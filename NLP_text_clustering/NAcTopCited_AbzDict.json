However, in vivo parcellation of these structures in humans has been rare, potentially impairing future research into the structural and functional characteristics and alterations of putative NAc subregions. Here, we used three complementary parcellation schemes based on tractography, task-independent functional connectivity, and task-dependent co-activation to investigate the regional differentiation within the NAc. We found that a 2-cluster solution with shell-like and core-like subdivisions provided the best description of the data and was consistent with the earlier anatomical shell/core architecture. The consensus clusters from this optimal solution, which was based on the three schemes, were used as the final parcels for the subsequent connection analyses. The resulting connectivity patterns presented inter-hemispheric symmetry, convergence and divergence across the modalities, and, most importantly, clearly distinct patterns between the two subregions. This convergent connectivity patterns also confirmed the connections  in animal models, supporting views that the two subregions could have antagonistic roles in some circumstances.

The NAc is necessary for using information about expected outcome values to guide behavior after reinforcer devaluation. Evidence suggests that core and shell subregions may play dissociable roles in guiding motivated behavior. Here, we recorded neural activity in the NAc core and shell during training and performance of a reinforcer devaluation task. Long-Evans male rats were trained that presses on a lever under an illuminated cue light delivered a flavored sucrose reward. On subsequent test days, each rat  was given free access to one of two distinctly flavored foods to consume to satiation and were then immediately tested on the lever pressing task under extinction conditions. Rats decreased pressing on the test day when the reinforcer earned during training was the sated flavor (devalued) compared with the test day when the reinforcer was not the sated flavor (nondevalued), demonstrating evidence of outcome-selective devaluation. Cue-selective encoding during training by NAc core (but not shell) neurons reliably predicted subsequent behavioral performance; that is, the greater the percentage of neurons that responded to the cue, the better the rats suppressed responding after devaluation. In contrast, NAc shell (but not core) neurons significantly decreased cue-selective encoding in the devalued condition compared with the nondevalued condition. These data reveal that NAc core and shell neurons encode information differentially about outcome-specific cues after reinforcer devaluation that are related to behavioral performance and outcome value, respectively.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Many neuropsychiatric disorders are marked by impairments in behavioral flexibility. Although the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is required for behavioral flexibility, it is not known how NAc neurons encode this  information. Here, we recorded NAc neurons during a training session in which rats learned that a cue predicted a specific reward and during a test session when that reward value was changed. Although encoding in the core during training predicted the ability of rats to change behavior after the reward value was altered, the NAc shell encoded information about the change in reward value during the test session. These findings suggest differential roles of the core and shell in behavioral flexibility.", "26691834": "We examined adaptations in nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons in mouse and rat peripheral nerve injury models of neuropathic pain. Injury selectively increased  excitability of NAc shell indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (iSPNs) and altered their synaptic connectivity.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides top-down control of sensory and affective processes. While animal and human imaging studies have shown that the PFC is involved in pain regulation, its exact role in pain states  remains incompletely understood. A key output target for the PFC is the nucleus accumbens (NAc), an important component of the reward circuitry. Interestingly, recent human imaging studies suggest that the projection from the PFC to the NAc  is altered in chronic pain. The function of this corticostriatal projection in pain states, however, is not known. Here we show that optogenetic activation of the PFC produces strong antinociceptive effects in a rat model (spared nerve injury model) of persistent neuropathic pain. PFC activation also reduces the affective symptoms of pain. Furthermore, we show that this pain-relieving function of the PFC is likely mediated by projections to the NAc. Thus, our results support a novel role for corticostriatal circuitry in pain regulation.", "25251489": "Nearly 40 years of research on the function of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has provided a wealth of information on its contributions to behavior but has also yielded controversies and misconceptions regarding these functions. A primary tenet of this review is that, rather than serving as a \"reward\" center, the NAc plays a key role in action selection, integrating cognitive and affective information processed by frontal and temporal lobe regions to augment the efficiency and vigor of appetitively or aversively motivated behaviors. Its involvement in these functions is most prominent when the appropriate course of action is ambiguous, uncertain, laden with distractors, or in a state of flux. To this end, different subregions of the NAc play dissociable roles in refining action selection, promoting approach toward motivationally relevant stimuli, suppressing inappropriate actions so that goals may be obtained more efficiently, and encoding action outcomes that guide the direction of subsequent ones.", "25082697": "Several symptoms associated with chronic pain, including fatigue and depression,  are characterized by reduced motivation to initiate or complete goal-directed tasks. However, it is unknown whether maladaptive modifications in neural circuits that regulate motivation occur during chronic pain.

Recently, the  processes and brain mechanisms underlying such behavior have been extensively studied from behavioral, neuroscientific and computational perspectives. This research has highlighted the processes underlying goal-directed behavior and associated brain systems including prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia and, in particular therein, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). This paper focusses on one particular process at the core of goal-directed behavior: how motivational value  is assigned to goals on the basis of internal states and environmental stimuli, and how this supports goal selection processes. Various biological and computational accounts have been given of this problem and of related multiple neural and behavior phenomena, but we still lack an integrated hypothesis on the  generation and use of value for goal selection. This paper proposes an hypothesis that aims to solve this problem and is based on this key elements: (a) amygdala and hippocampus establish the motivational value of stimuli and goals; (b) prefrontal cortex encodes various types of action outcomes; (c) NAcc integrates different sources of value, representing them in terms of a common currency with  the aid of dopamine, and thereby plays a major role in selecting action outcomes  within prefrontal cortex. The \"goals\" pursued by the organism are the outcomes selected by these processes. The hypothesis is developed in the context of a critical review of relevant biological and computational literature which offer it support. The paper shows how the hypothesis has the potential to integrate existing interpretations of motivational value and goal selection.", "24107968": "In addition to their well-established role in signaling rewarding outcomes and reward-predictive cues and in mediating positive reinforcement, there is growing  evidence that nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons also signal aversive events and cues that predict them. Here we use diffusion tractography to subdivide the right NAc into lateral-rostral (putative core, pcore) and medial-caudal (putative shell, pshell) subdivisions in humans. The two subregions exhibited differential  structural connectivity, based on probabilistic tractography, to prefrontal cortical and subcortical limbic regions. We also demonstrate unique roles for each of the two subdivisions for monetary reward and thermal pain perception tasks: pshell signaling impending pain and value predictions for monetary gambles and pcore activating with anticipation of cessation of thermal pain (signaling reward value of analgesia). We examined functional connectivity for resting state, monetary reward, and thermal pain tasks, and for all three conditions observed that pcore and pshell of right NAc exhibit distinct patterns of synchrony (functional connectivity) to prefrontal cortical and subcortical limbic targets within the right hemisphere. To validate the NAc segregation, we mirrored the coordinates of right NAc pcore and pshell onto the left hemisphere and examined structural and resting state connectivity in the left hemisphere. This latter analysis closely replicated target-specific connections we obtained for the right hemisphere. Overall, we demonstrate that the human NAc can be parceled  based on structural and functional connectivity, and that activity in these subdivisions differentially encodes values for expected pain relief and for expected monetary reward.", "23184995": "Relief of pain is rewarding. Using a model of experimental postsurgical pain we show that blockade of afferent input from the injury with local anesthetic elicits conditioned place preference, activates ventral tegmental dopaminergic cells, and increases dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens.

These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many long-distance correlations are decreased by subject motion, whereas many short-distance correlations are increased. These  changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development.

The NAc has two major components, the core and the shell. These two areas have different  inputs and outputs, suggesting that they contribute differentially to goal-directed behaviors. Using a discriminative stimulus (DS) task in rats and inactivating the NAc by blocking excitatory inputs with glutamate antagonists, we dissociated core and shell contributions to task performance. NAc core but not shell inactivation decreased responding to a reward-predictive cue. In contrast,  inactivation of either subregion induced a general behavioral disinhibition. This reveals that the NAc actively suppresses actions inappropriate to the DS task. Importantly, selective inactivation of the shell but not core significantly increased responding to the nonrewarded cue. To determine whether the different contributions of the NAc core and shell depend on the information encoded in their constituent neurons, we performed electrophysiological recording in rats performing the DS task. Although there was no firing pattern unique to either core or shell, the reward-predictive cue elicited more frequent and larger magnitude responses in the NAc core than in the shell. Conversely, more NAc shell neurons selectively responded to the nonrewarded stimulus. These quantitative differences might account for the different behavioral patterns that require either core or shell. Neurons with similar firing patterns could also have different effects on behavior due to their distinct projection targets.", "21352927": "Automatic segmentation of subcortical structures in human brain MR images is an important but difficult task due to poor and variable intensity contrast. Clear,  well-defined intensity features are absent in many places along typical structure boundaries and so extra information is required to achieve successful segmentation. A method is proposed here that uses manually labelled image data to provide anatomical training information. It utilises the principles of the Active Shape and Appearance Models but places them within a Bayesian framework, allowing probabilistic relationships between shape and intensity to be fully exploited. The model is trained for 15 different subcortical structures using 336 manually-labelled T1-weighted MR images. Using the Bayesian approach, conditional probabilities can be calculated easily and efficiently, avoiding technical problems of ill-conditioned covariance matrices, even with weak priors, and eliminating the need for fitting extra empirical scaling parameters, as is required in standard Active Appearance Models. Furthermore, differences in boundary vertex locations provide a direct, purely local measure of geometric change in structure between groups that, unlike voxel-based morphometry, is not dependent on tissue classification methods or arbitrary smoothing. In this paper  the fully-automated segmentation method is presented and assessed both quantitatively, using Leave-One-Out testing on the 336 training images, and qualitatively, using an independent clinical dataset involving Alzheimer's disease. Median Dice overlaps between 0.7 and 0.9 are obtained with this method,  which is comparable or better than other automated methods.

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been implicated in the ability to choose between options with different costs and overcome high costs when necessary, but it is not clear how NAc processing contributes to this  role. Here, neuronal activity in the rat NAc was monitored using multi-neuron electrophysiology during two cost-based decision tasks in which either reward effort or reward delay was manipulated. In each task, distinct visual cues predicted high-value (low effort/immediate) and low-value (high effort/delayed) rewards. After training, animals exhibited a behavioral preference for high-value rewards, yet overcame high costs when necessary to obtain rewards. Electrophysiological analysis indicated that a subgroup of NAc neurons exhibited  phasic increases in firing rate during cue presentations. In the effort-based decision task (but not the delay-based task), this population reflected the cost-discounted value of the future response. In contrast, other subgroups of cells were activated during response initiation or reward delivery, but activity  did not differ on the basis of reward cost. Finally, another population of cells  exhibited sustained changes in firing rate while animals completed high-effort requirements or waited for delayed rewards. These findings are consistent with previous reports that implicate NAc function in reward prediction and behavioral  allocation during reward-seeking behavior, and suggest a mechanism by which NAc activity contributes to both cost-based decisions and actual cost expenditure.", "19846724": "The ventral striatum (VS) is thought to serve as a gateway whereby associative information from the amygdala and prefrontal regions can influence motor output to guide behavior. If VS mediates this \"limbic-motor\" interface, then one might expect neural correlates in VS to reflect this information. Specifically, neural  activity should reflect the integration of motivational value with subsequent behavior. To test this prediction, we recorded from single units in VS while rats performed a choice task in which different odor cues indicated that reward was available on the left or on the right. The value of reward associated with a left or rightward movement was manipulated in separate blocks of trials by either varying the delay preceding reward delivery or by changing reward size. Rats' behavior was influenced by the value of the expected reward and the response required to obtain it, and activity in the majority of cue-responsive VS neurons  reflected the integration of these two variables. Unlike similar cue-evoked activity reported previously in dopamine neurons, these correlates were only observed if the directional response was subsequently executed. Furthermore, activity was correlated with the speed at which the rats' executed the response.  These results are consistent with the notion that VS serves to integrate information about the value of an expected reward with motor output during decision making.", "19812543": "Although cells in many brain regions respond to reward, the cortical-basal ganglia circuit is at the heart of the reward system. The key structures in this  network are the anterior cingulate cortex, the orbital prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum, the ventral pallidum, and the midbrain dopamine neurons. In addition, other structures, including the dorsal prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and lateral habenular nucleus, and specific brainstem structures such as the pedunculopontine nucleus, and the raphe nucleus, are key components in regulating the reward circuit. Connectivity between these areas forms a complex neural network that mediates different aspects of reward processing. Advances in neuroimaging techniques allow better spatial and temporal resolution. These studies now demonstrate that human functional and structural imaging results map increasingly close to primate anatomy.", "17574681": "Anatomical and functional refinements of the meso-limbic dopamine system of the rat are discussed. Present experiments suggest that dopaminergic neurons localized in the posteromedial ventral tegmental area (VTA) and central linear nucleus raphe selectively project to the ventromedial striatum (medial olfactory  tubercle and medial nucleus accumbens shell), whereas the anteromedial VTA has few if any projections to the ventral striatum, and the lateral VTA largely projects to the ventrolateral striatum (accumbens core, lateral shell and lateral tubercle). These findings complement the recent behavioral findings that cocaine  and amphetamine are more rewarding when administered into the ventromedial striatum than into the ventrolateral striatum. Drugs such as nicotine and opiates are more rewarding when administered into the posterior VTA or the central linear nucleus than into the anterior VTA. A review of the literature suggests that (1)  the midbrain has corresponding zones for the accumbens core and medial shell; (2) the striatal portion of the olfactory tubercle is a ventral extension of the nucleus accumbens shell; and (3) a model of two dopamine projection systems from  the ventral midbrain to the ventral striatum is useful for understanding reward function. The medial projection system is important in the regulation of arousal  characterized by affect and drive and plays a different role in goal-directed learning than the lateral projection system, as described in the variation-selection hypothesis of striatal functional organization.", "12117573": "There is a long-standing interest in the role of endogenous opioid peptides in feeding behavior and, in particular, in the modulation of food reward and palatability. Since drugs such as heroin, morphine, alcohol, and cannabinoids, interact with this system, there may be important common neural substrates between food and drug reward with regard to the brain's opioid systems. In this paper, we review the proposed functional role of opioid neurotransmission and mu  opiate receptors within the nucleus accumbens and surrounding ventral striatum. Opioid compounds, particularly those selective for the mu receptor, induce a potent increase in food intake, sucrose, salt, saccharin, and ethanol intake. We  have explored this phenomenon with regard to macronutrient selection, regional specificity, role of output structures, Fos mapping, analysis of motivational state, and enkephalin gene expression. We hypothesize that opioid-mediated mechanisms within ventral striatal medium spiny neurons mediate the affective or  hedonic response to food ('liking' or food 'pleasure'). A further refinement of this hypothesis is that activation of ventral striatal opioids specifically encodes positive affect induced by tasty and/or calorically dense foods (such as  sugar and fat), and promotes behaviors associated with this enhanced palatability. It is proposed that this brain mechanism was beneficial in evolutionary development for ensuring the consumption of relatively scarce, high-energy food sources. However, in modern times, with unlimited supplies of high-calorie food, it has contributed to the present epidemic of obesity.", "10415642": "The ventral striatum, which prominently includes the nucleus accumbens (Acb), is  a heterogeneous area. Within the Acb of rats, a peripherally located shell and a  centrally situated core can be recognized that have different connectional, neurochemical, and functional identities. Although the Acb core resembles in many respects the dorsally adjacent caudate-putamen complex in its striatal character, the Acb shell has, in addition to striatal features, a more diverse array of neurochemical characteristics, and afferent and efferent connections. Inputs and  outputs of the Acb, in particular of the shell, are inhomogeneously distributed,  resulting in a mosaical arrangement of concentrations of afferent fibers and terminals and clusters of output neurons. To determine the precise relationships  between the distributional patterns of various afferents (e.g., from the prefrontal cortex, the basal amygdaloid complex, the hippocampal formation, and the midline/intralaminar thalamic nuclei) and efferents to the ventral pallidum and mesencephalon, neuroanatomical anterograde and retrograde tracing experiments were carried out. The results of the double anterograde, double retrograde, and anterograde/retrograde tracing experiments indicate that various parts of the shell (dorsomedial, ventromedial, ventral, and lateral) and the core (medial and  lateral) have different input-output characteristics. Furthermore, within these Acb regions, various populations of neurons can be identified, arranged in a cluster-like fashion, onto which specific sets of afferents converge and that project to particular output stations, distinct from the input-output relationships of neighboring, cluster-like neuronal populations. These results support the idea that the nucleus accumbens may consist of a collection of neuronal ensembles with different input-output relationships and, presumably, different functional characteristics.", "9580643": "The present study was designed to further investigate the nature of feeding induced by opioid stimulation of the nucleus accumbens through an examination of  the effects of intra-accumbens (ACB) opioids on macronutrient selection. In 3-hr  tests of free-feeding (satiated) rats, intra-ACB administration of the mu receptor agonist D-Ala2,N,Me-Phe4, Gly-ol5-enkephalin (DAMGO; 0, 0.025, 0.25 and  2.5 micrograms bilaterally) markedly enhanced the intake of fat or carbohydrate when the diets were presented individually (although the effect on fat intake was much greater in magnitude). Intra-ACB injections of DAMGO, however, produced potent preferential stimulatory effects on fat ingestion with no effect on carbohydrate ingestion when both fat and carbohydrate diets were present simultaneously. Moreover, this selective stimulation of fat intake was independent of base-line diet preference and could be blocked by systemic injection of naltrexone (5 mg/kg). We also examined the effect of 24-hr food deprivation on the pattern of macronutrient intake in rats with access to both carbohydrate and fat. In contrast to the DAMGO-induced selective enhancement of fat intake, food deprivation significantly increased the intake of both diets to  the same extent; however, in this case, only the stimulated fat intake was blocked by systemic naltrexone. Intra-ACB administration of DAMGO in hungry rats  produced an effect similar to that observed in free-feeding rats; preference was  strongly shifted to fat intake. Similarly, the opioid antagonist naltrexone (20 micrograms) infused directly into ACB preferentially decreased fat intake in hungry rats. These findings suggest that endogenous opioids within the ventral striatum may participate in the mechanisms governing preferences for highly palatable foods, especially those rich in fat.", "8782538": "Author information:  (1)Graduate School of Neurosciences Amsterdam, Research Institute Neurosciences Vrije Universiteit, The Netherlands.", "6999537": "From motivation to action: functional interface between the limbic system and the motor system.", "30459564": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is clearly implicated in reward processing and drug addiction, as well as in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders; nevertheless, the circuit mechanisms underlying the diverse functions of the NAc  remain poorly understood.

We discovered that D1R-MSNs and D2R-MSNs in both NAc subregions receive  similar inputs from diverse sources. Inputs to the NAc core are broadly scattered, whereas inputs to the NAc shell are relatively concentrated. Furthermore, we identified numerous brain areas providing important contrasting inputs to different NAc subregions.

We discuss potential mechanisms by which MSN subtype function promotes dichotomous behavioral outcomes caused by differences in cellular plasticity, subcellular signaling pathways, and genetic expression.

Here we focus on the potential role of the nucleus accumbens (NAc; ventral striatum) and its dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which form the mesolimbic dopamine system, in depression. The mesolimbic dopamine system is most often associated with the rewarding effects of food, sex, and drugs of abuse. Given the prominence of anhedonia, reduced motivation, and decreased energy level in most individuals with depression, we propose that the NAc and VTA contribute importantly to the pathophysiology and symptomatology of depression and may even be involved in its etiology. We review recent studies showing that manipulations of key proteins (e.g. CREB, dynorphin, BDNF, MCH, or Clock) within the VTA-NAc circuit of rodents produce unique behavioral phenotypes, some of which are directly relevant to depression.

Non-invasive brain imaging has, over the past several decades, contributed important new insights into the neuroplastic adaptations that result from chronic drug intake, but additional experimental approaches and neurobiological hypotheses are needed to better capture the totality of the motivational, affective, cognitive, genetic and pharmacological complexities of the disease. Recent advances in assessing network dynamics through resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) may allow for such systems-level assessments. In this review, we first summarize the nascent addiction-related rsFC literature and suggest that in using this tool, circuit connectivity may inform specific neurobiological substrates underlying psychological dysfunctions associated with reward, affective and cognitive processing often observed in drug addicts. Using nicotine addiction as an exemplar, we subsequently provide a heuristic framework to guide  future research by linking recent findings from intrinsic network connectivity studies with those interrogating nicotine's neuropharmacological actions. Emerging evidence supports a critical role for the insula in nicotine addiction.  Likewise, the anterior insula, potentially together with the anterior cingulate cortex, appears to pivotally influence the dynamics between large-scale brain networks subserving internal (default-mode network) and external (executive control network) information processing. We suggest that a better understanding of how the insula modulates the interaction between these networks is critical for elucidating both the cognitive impairments often associated with withdrawal and the performance-enhancing effects of nicotine administration.

An ongoing controversy in the field is to what extent the behavioral effects of nicotine result from activation of nAChRs, and to what extent receptor desensitization is involved in these behavioral processes. Recent electrophysiological studies have shown that both nAChR activation and desensitization contribute to the effects of nicotine in the brain, and these experiments have provided cellular mechanisms that could underlie the contribution of both these processes to nicotine-mediated behaviors. For instance, desensitization of nAChRs may contribute to the salience of environmental cues associated with smoking behavior and activation and desensitization of nAChRs may contribute to both primary and conditioned drug reward. Similarly, studies of the antidepressant-like effects of nicotinic agents have revealed a balance between activation and desensitization of nAChRs. This review will examine the evidence for the contribution of these two very different consequences of nicotine administration to behaviors related to nicotine addiction, including processes related to drug reinforcement and affective modulation.

By monitoring neuronal ensembles in mouse dCA1\u2192NAc pathway, combined with cell-type selective optogenetic manipulations of input-defined postsynaptic neurons, we show that dCA1 PYRs drive NAc medium spiny neurons and orchestrate their spiking activity using feedforward inhibition mediated by dCA1-connected parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking interneurons. This tripartite cross-circuit motif supports spatial appetitive memory and associated  NAc assemblies, being independent of dorsal subiculum and dispensable for both spatial novelty detection and reward seeking.

Specifically, we asked whether D1-Cre mice would instrumentally seek optogenetic  self-stimulation specifically targeted at D1 MSNs in NAc, and similarly if D2-Cre mice would self-stimulate D2 neurons in NAc. Mice were implanted with Cre-targeted channelrhodopsin (ChR2) virus and optic fibers in NAc. Subsequently, mice could earn brief NAc laser illuminations by actively touching a metal spout  in one task, or by going to a particular location in a separate task. Results indicated that D1 neuronal excitation in NAc supported intense self-stimulation in both tasks. D1-Cre mice earned hundreds to thousands of spout-touches per half-hour session, and also sought out locations that delivered NAc laser to excite D1 MSNs. By comparison, D2 ChR2 mice showed lower but still positive levels of self-stimulation in the spout-touch task, earning dozens to hundreds of NAc laser illuminations. However, in the location task, D2 mice failed to show positive self-stimulation. If anything, a few D2 individuals gradually avoided the laser location. Brain-wide measures indicated that D1 and D2 stimulations in  NAc recruited heavily overlapping patterns of Fos activation in distant limbic structures.

The information encoded in each excitatory afferent to the NAc is unknown, in part because it is unclear when these pathways are active  in relation to behavior. Here we compare the activity profiles of amygdala, hippocampal, and thalamic inputs to the NAc shell in mice performing a cued reward-seeking task using GCaMP-based fiber photometry. We find that the rostral  and caudal ends of the NAc shell are innervated by distinct but intermingled populations of forebrain neurons that exhibit divergent feeding-related activity. In the rostral NAc shell, a coordinated network-wide reduction in excitatory drive correlates with feeding, and reduced input from individual pathways is sufficient to promote it. Overall, the data suggest that pathway-specific input activity at a population level may vary more across the NAc than between pathways.", "27337658": "Striatal dopamine receptor D1-expressing neurons have been classically associated with positive reinforcement and reward, whereas D2 neurons are associated with negative reinforcement and aversion. Here we demonstrate that the pattern of activation of D1 and D2 neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) predicts motivational drive, and that optogenetic activation of either neuronal population enhances motivation in mice. Using a different approach in rats, we further show  that activating NAc D2 neurons increases cue-induced motivational drive in control animals and in a model that presents anhedonia and motivational deficits; conversely, optogenetic inhibition of D2 neurons decreases motivation. Our results suggest that the classic view of D1-D2 functional antagonism does not hold true for all dimensions of reward-related behaviours, and that D2 neurons may play a more prominent pro-motivation role than originally anticipated.", "26593092": "Feeding satisfies metabolic need but is also controlled by external stimuli, like palatability or predator threat. Nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) projections to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) are implicated in mediating such feeding control, but the neurons involved and their mechanism of action remain elusive. We show that dopamine D1R-expressing NAcSh neurons (D1R-MSNs) provide the dominant source of accumbal inhibition to LH and provide rapid control over feeding via LH GABA neurons. In freely feeding mice, D1R-MSN activity reduced during consumption, while their optogenetic inhibition prolonged feeding, even in the face of distracting stimuli. Conversely, activation of D1R-MSN terminals in LH was sufficient to abruptly stop ongoing consumption, even during hunger. Direct inhibition of LH GABA neurons, which received input from D1R-MSNs, fully recapitulated these findings. Together, our study resolves a feeding circuit that overrides immediate metabolic need to allow rapid consumption control in response to changing external stimuli. VIDEO ABSTRACT.", "24853771": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has a central role in the mechanism of action of drugs of abuse. The major neuronal type within the NAc is the GABAergic medium spiny neuron (MSN), with two major subpopulations defined-termed D1-type and D2-type MSNs-based on the predominant dopamine receptor expressed. However, very  little is known about the contribution of altered GABAergic function in NAc MSNs  to the neural and behavioral plasticity that contributes to the lasting actions of drugs of abuse. In the present study, we show that GABAergic activity is selectively modulated in D1-type MSNs of the NAc by signaling of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB), and that such adaptations control rewarding responses to morphine. Optical activation of D1-type MSNs, or the knockout of TrkB from D1-type MSNs (D1-TrkB KO), enhances morphine reward, effects not seen for D2-type MSNs. In addition, D1-TrkB KO mice, but not D2-TrkB KO mice, display decreased GABAA receptor (GABAAR) subunit expression and reduced spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in D1-type, but not D2-type, MSNs in the NAc. Furthermore, we found that GABAAR antagonism in the NAc enhances morphine reward and that morphine exposure decreases TrkB expression as well as GABAergic activity in D1-type MSNs. Together, these data provide evidence for the enhancement of morphine reward through reduction of inhibitory GABAAR responses, an adaptation mediated by morphine-induced reduction of BDNF-TrkB signaling in D1-type MSNs.", "23551138": "Intense fearful behavior and/or intense appetitive eating behavior can be generated by localized amino acid inhibitions along a rostrocaudal anatomical gradient within medial shell of nucleus accumbens of the rat. This can be produced by microinjections in medial shell of either the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A agonist muscimol (mimicking intrinsic GABAergic inputs) or the AMPA (\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid) antagonist DNQX (6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione), disrupting corticolimbic glutamate inputs). At rostral sites in medial shell, each drug robustly stimulates appetitive eating and food intake, whereas at more caudal sites the same drugs instead produce increasingly fearful behaviors such as escape, distress vocalizations and defensive treading (an antipredator behavior rodents emit to snakes and scorpions). Previously we showed that intense motivated behaviors generated by glutamate blockade require local endogenous dopamine and can be modulated in valence by environmental ambience. Here we investigated whether GABAergic generation of intense appetitive and fearful motivations similarly depends on local dopamine signals, and whether the valence of motivations generated by GABAergic inhibition can also be retuned by changes in environmental ambience. We report that the answer to both questions is 'no'. Eating and fear generated by GABAergic inhibition of accumbens shell does not need endogenous dopamine. Also,  the appetitive/fearful valence generated by GABAergic muscimol microinjections resists environmental retuning and is determined almost purely by rostrocaudal anatomical placement. These results suggest that nucleus accumbens GABAergic release of fear and eating are relatively independent of modulatory dopamine signals, and more anatomically pre-determined in valence balance than release of  the same intense behaviors by glutamate disruptions.", "22981656": "BACKGROUND: Corticolimbic circuits, including direct projections from prefrontal  cortex to nucleus accumbens (NAc), permit top-down control of intense motivations generated by subcortical circuits. In rats, localized disruptions of glutamate signaling within medial shell of NAc generate desire or dread, anatomically organized along a rostrocaudal gradient analogous to a limbic keyboard. At rostral locations in shell, these disruptions generate appetitive eating, but at  caudal locations the disruptions generate progressively fearful behaviors (distress vocalizations, escape attempts, and antipredator reactions). Here, we asked whether medial prefrontal cortex can modulate intense motivations generated by subcortical NAc disruptions. METHODS: We used simultaneous microinjections in medial prefrontal cortex regions and in NAc shell to examine whether the desire or dread generated by NAc shell disruptions is modulated by activation/inhibition of three specific regions of prefrontal cortex: medial orbitofrontal cortex, infralimbic cortex (homologous to area 25 or subgenual anterior cingulate in the human), or prelimbic cortex (midventral anterior cingulate). RESULTS: We found that activation of medial orbitofrontal cortex biased intense bivalent motivation in an appetitive direction by amplifying generation of eating behavior by middle to caudal NAc disruptions, without altering fear. In contrast, activation of infralimbic prefrontal cortex powerfully and generally suppressed both appetitive eating and fearful behaviors generated by NAc shell disruptions.

Insofar as the connections of this hedonic \"hotspot\" were not singled out for special attention in the earlier neuroanatomical literature, we undertook to examine them. We observed that the patterns of inputs and outputs of the rdAcbSh are not qualitatively different from those of the rest of the Acb, except that outputs from the rdAcbSh to the lateral preoptic area and anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas are anomalously robust and overlap extensively with those of the lateral septum. We also detected reciprocal interconnections between the rdAcbSh and lateral septum. Whether and how these connections subserve hedonic impact remains to be learned, but these observations lead us to hypothesize that the rdAcbSh represents a basal forebrain transition area, in the sense that it is invaded by neurons of the lateral septum, or possibly transitional neuronal forms sharing properties of both structures. We note that the proposed transition zone between lateral septum and rdAcbSh would be but one  of many in the basal forebrain and conclude by reiterating the longstanding argument that the transitional nature of such boundary areas has functional importance, of which the precise nature will remain elusive until the neurophysiological and neuropharmacological implications of such zones of transition are more generally acknowledged and better addressed.", "22019344": "Pronounced feeding can be elicited by injections of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol  into the medial shell region of the nucleus accumbens (AcbSh). This region of AcbSh has been shown to project to both the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and the medial ventral pallidum (VPm). The current study examined the effects of unilateral LH or VPm lesions on the ingestive responses induced by injections of  muscimol into the AcbSh on either the same or the opposite side of the brain. We  found that lesions of either of these structures drastically attenuated feeding induced from the ipsilateral, as compared to the contralateral, AcbSh. The \"ipsilateral/contralateral disruption design\" employed here virtually rules out the possibility that the suppressive effects of the lesions were nonspecific and  suggests that the VPm and LH play essential roles in mediating the ingestive effects of inactivation of the AcbSh.", "21900565": "The medial shell of nucleus accumbens (NAc) and its mesolimbic dopamine inputs mediate forms of fearful as well as of incentive motivation. For example, either  appetitive and/or actively fearful behaviors are generated in a keyboard pattern  by localized glutamate disruptions in NAc (via microinjection of the AMPA receptor antagonist DNQX) at different anatomical locations along a rostrocaudal  gradient within the medial shell of rats. Rostral glutamate disruptions produce intense increases in eating, but more caudally placed disruptions produce increasingly fearful behaviors: distress vocalizations and escape attempts to human touch, and a spontaneous and directed antipredator response called defensive treading/burying. Local endogenous dopamine is required for either intense motivation to be generated by AMPA disruptions. Here we report that only  endogenous local signaling at D(1) dopamine receptors is needed for rostral generation of excessive eating, potentially implicating a direct output pathway contribution. In contrast, fear generation at caudal sites requires both D(1) and D(2) signaling simultaneously, potentially implicating an indirect output pathway contribution. Finally, when motivation valence generated by AMPA disruptions at intermediate sites was flipped by manipulating environmental ambience, from mostly appetitive in a comfortable home environment to mostly fearful in a stressful environment, the roles of local D(1) and D(2) signaling in dopamine/glutamate interaction at microinjection sites also switched dynamically  to match the motivation valence generated at the moment. Thus, NAc D(1) and D(2)  receptors, and their associated neuronal circuits, play different and dynamic roles in enabling desire and dread to be generated by localized NAc glutamate disruptions in medial shell.", "21670308": "Multiple signals for reward-hedonic impact, motivation, and learned associative prediction-are funneled through brain mesocorticolimbic circuits involving the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum. Here, we show how the hedonic \"liking\" and motivation \"wanting\" signals for a sweet reward are distinctly modulated and  tracked in this circuit separately from signals for Pavlovian predictions (learning). Animals first learned to associate a fixed sequence of Pavlovian cues with sucrose reward. Subsequent intraaccumbens microinjections of an opioid-stimulating drug increased the hedonic liking impact of sucrose in behavior and firing signals of ventral pallidum neurons, and likewise, they increased incentive salience signals in firing to the reward-proximal incentive cue (but did not alter firing signals to the learned prediction value of a reward-distal cue). Microinjection of a dopamine-stimulating drug instead enhanced only the motivation component but did not alter hedonic impact or learned prediction signals. Different dedicated neuronal subpopulations in the ventral pallidum tracked signal enhancements for hedonic impact vs. incentive salience, and a faster firing pattern also distinguished incentive signals from slower hedonic signals, even for a third overlapping population. These results reveal separate neural representations of wanting, liking, and prediction components of the same reward within the nucleus accumbens to ventral pallidum segment of mesocorticolimbic circuitry.", "20947769": "The nucleus accumbens is a key mediator of cocaine reward, but the distinct roles of the two subpopulations of nucleus accumbens projection neurons, those expressing dopamine D1 versus D2 receptors, are poorly understood. We show that deletion of TrkB, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor, selectively from D1+ or D2+ neurons oppositely affects cocaine reward. Because loss of TrkB in D2+ neurons increases their neuronal excitability, we next used optogenetic tools to control selectively the firing rate of D1+ and D2+ nucleus accumbens neurons and studied consequent effects on cocaine reward. Activation of D2+ neurons, mimicking the loss of TrkB, suppresses cocaine reward, with opposite effects induced by activation of D1+ neurons. These results provide insight into  the molecular control of D1+ and D2+ neuronal activity as well as the circuit-level contribution of these cell types to cocaine reward.", "20696892": "The brain is usually described as hierarchically organized, although an alternative network model has been proposed. To help distinguish between these two fundamentally different structure-function hypotheses, we developed an experimental circuit-tracing strategy that can be applied to any starting point in the nervous system and then systematically expanded, and applied it to a previously obscure dorsomedial corner of the nucleus accumbens identified functionally as a \"hedonic hot spot.\" A highly topographically organized set of connections involving expected and unexpected gray matter regions was identified  that prominently features regions associated with appetite, stress, and clinical  depression. These connections are arranged as a longitudinal series of circuits (closed loops). Thus, the results do not support a rigidly hierarchical model of  nervous system organization but instead indicate a network model of organization. In principle, the double-coinjection circuit tracing strategy can be applied systematically to the rest of the nervous system to establish the architecture of the global structural wiring diagram, and its abstraction, the connectome.", "20585461": "BACKGROUND: GABAergic signals to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell arise from predominantly subcortical sources whereas glutamatergic signals arise mainly from cortical-related sources. Here we contrasted GABAergic and glutamatergic generation of hedonics versus motivation processes, as a proxy for comparing subcortical and cortical controls of emotion. Local disruptions of either signals in medial shell of NAc generate intense motivated behaviors corresponding to desire and/or dread, along a rostrocaudal gradient. GABA or glutamate disruptions in rostral shell generate appetitive motivation whereas disruptions in caudal shell elicit fearful motivation. However, GABA and glutamate signals in NAc differ in important ways, despite the similarity of their rostrocaudal motivation gradients. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Microinjections of a GABA(A) agonist (muscimol),  or of a glutamate AMPA antagonist (DNQX) in medial shell of rats were assessed for generation of hedonic \"liking\" or \"disliking\" by measuring orofacial affective reactions to sucrose-quinine taste. Motivation generation was independently assessed measuring effects on eating versus natural defensive behaviors. For GABAergic microinjections, we found that the desire-dread motivation gradient was mirrored by an equivalent hedonic gradient that amplified affective taste \"liking\" (at rostral sites) versus \"disliking\" (at caudal sites). However, manipulation of glutamatergic signals completely failed to alter pleasure-displeasure reactions to sensory hedonic impact, despite producing a strong rostrocaudal gradient of motivation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that the nucleus accumbens contains two functional affective keyboards for amino-acid signals: a motivation-generating keyboard and a hedonic-generating keyboard. Corticolimbic glutamate signals and subcortical GABA signals equivalently engage the motivation keyboard to generate  desire and-or dread. Only subcortical GABA signals additionally engage the hedonic keyboard to amplify affective \"liking\" and \"disliking\" reactions. We thus suggest that top-down cortical glutamate signals powerfully regulate motivation components, but are relatively unable to penetrate core hedonic components of emotion. That may carry implications of limits to therapeutic regulation of pathological emotions.", "20357125": "Nucleus accumbens (NAc) inactivation increases food intake, indicating that NAc neurons exert ongoing inhibition of feeding. We previously described a subpopulation of NAc neurons that pause during sucrose licking and proposed that  the pause permits consumption. We tested this hypothesis by first recording NAc neurons during sucrose consumption, and then electrically stimulating through the same electrodes. A large proportion of NAc shell and core neurons were inhibited  during sucrose consumption, and local electrical stimulation abruptly interrupted licking. Effective stimulation sites were more anterior than ineffective sites in NAc. At low stimulus intensities, licking resumed immediately on stimulation offset. The latency to lick resumption from NAc neuron inhibition onset ( approximately 460 ms) was very similar to that after electrical stimulation offset ( approximately 440 ms). These results directly support the hypothesis that a significant subpopulation of NAc neurons inhibit palatable food consumption and that a pause in their firing is required to initiate and maintain consumption.", "19941931": "The basal ganglia are often conceptualised as three parallel domains that include all the constituent nuclei. The 'ventral domain' appears to be critical for learning flexible behaviours for exploration and foraging, as it is the recipient of converging inputs from amygdala, hippocampal formation and prefrontal cortex,  putatively centres for stimulus evaluation, spatial navigation, and planning/contingency, respectively. However, compared to work on the dorsal domains, the rich potential for quantitative theories and models of the ventral domain remains largely untapped, and the purpose of this review is to provide the stimulus for this work. We systematically review the ventral domain's structures  and internal organisation, and propose a functional architecture as the basis for computational models. Using a full schematic of the structure of inputs to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens core and shell), we argue for the existence of many identifiable processing channels on the basis of unique combinations of afferent inputs. We then identify the potential information represented in these  channels by reconciling a broad range of studies from the hippocampal, amygdala and prefrontal cortex literatures with known properties of the ventral striatum from lesion, pharmacological, and electrophysiological studies. Dopamine's key role in learning is reviewed within the three current major computational frameworks; we also show that the shell-based basal ganglia sub-circuits are well placed to generate the phasic burst and dip responses of dopaminergic neurons. We detail dopamine's modulation of ventral basal ganglia's inputs by its actions on  pre-synaptic terminals and post-synaptic membranes in the striatum, arguing that  the complexity of these effects hint at computational roles for dopamine beyond current ideas. The ventral basal ganglia are revealed as a constellation of multiple functional systems for the learning and selection of flexible behaviours and of behavioural strategies, sharing the common operations of selection-by-disinhibition and of dopaminergic modulation.", "18978779": "Rewarding and aversive stimuli evoke very different patterns of behavior and are  rapidly discriminated. Here taste stimuli of opposite hedonic valence evoked opposite patterns of dopamine and metabolic activity within milliseconds in the nucleus accumbens. This rapid encoding may serve to guide ongoing behavioral responses and promote plastic changes in underlying circuitry.", "18675281": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a critical element of the mesocorticolimbic system, a brain circuit implicated in reward and motivation. This basal forebrain structure receives dopamine (DA) input from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and  glutamate (GLU) input from regions including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMG), and hippocampus (HIP). As such, it integrates inputs from limbic  and cortical regions, linking motivation with action. The NAc has a well-established role in mediating the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse and natural rewards such as food and sexual behavior. However, accumulating pharmacological, molecular, and electrophysiological evidence has raised the possibility that it also plays an important (and sometimes underappreciated) role in mediating aversive states. Here we review evidence that rewarding and aversive states are encoded in the activity of NAc medium spiny GABAergic neurons, which account for the vast majority of the neurons in this region. While admittedly simple, this working hypothesis is testable using combinations of available and emerging technologies, including electrophysiology, genetic engineering, and functional brain imaging. A deeper understanding of the basic neurobiology of mood states will facilitate the development of well-tolerated medications that treat and prevent addiction and other conditions (e.g., mood disorders) associated with dysregulation of brain motivation systems.", "18344996": "The nucleus accumbens mediates both appetitive motivation for rewards and fearful motivation toward threats, which are generated in part by glutamate-related circuits organized in a keyboard fashion. At rostral sites of the medial shell, localized glutamate disruptions typically generate intense appetitive behaviors in rats, but the disruption incrementally generates fearful behaviors as microinjection sites move more caudally. We found that exposure to stressful environments caused caudal fear-generating zones to expand rostrally, filling approximately 90% of the shell. Conversely, a preferred home environment caused fear-generating zones to shrink and appetitive-generating zones to expand caudally, filling approximately 90% of the shell. Thus, the emotional environments retuned the generation of motivation in corticolimbic circuits.", "18341996": "The motivation to seek cocaine comes in part from a dysregulation of reward processing manifested in dysphoria, or affective withdrawal. Learning is a critical aspect of drug abuse; however, it remains unclear whether drug-associated cues can elicit the emotional withdrawal symptoms that promote cocaine use. Here we report that a cocaine-associated taste cue elicited a conditioned aversive state that was behaviorally and neurophysiologically quantifiable and predicted subsequent cocaine self-administration behavior. Specifically, brief intraoral infusions of a cocaine-predictive flavored saccharin solution elicited aversive orofacial responses that predicted early-session cocaine taking in rats. The expression of aversive taste reactivity also was associated with a shift in the predominant pattern of electrophysiological activity of nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons from inhibitory  to excitatory. The dynamic nature of this conditioned switch in affect and the neural code reveals a mechanism by which cues may exert control over drug self-administration.", "18256852": "The striatum can be divided into dorsal (caudate-putamen) and ventral parts. In the ventral division, the nucleus accumbens, which subserves adaptive and goal-directed behaviors, is further subdivided into shell and core. Accumbal neurons show different types of experience-dependent plasticity: those in the core seem to discriminate the motivational value of conditioned stimuli, features that rely on the integration of information and enhanced synaptic plasticity at the many spines on these cells, whereas shell neurons seem to be involved with the release of predetermined behavior patterns in relation to unconditioned stimuli, and the behavioral consequences of repeated administration of addictive  drugs. In the core, the principal neurons are medium sized and densely spiny, but in the medial shell, these same neurons are much smaller and their dendrites, significantly less spiny, suggesting that morphological differences could mediate unique neuroadaptations associated with each region. This review is focused on evaluating the structural differences in nucleus accumbens core and shell neurons and discusses how such different morphologies could underlie distinguishable behavioral processes.", "16399690": "The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is critical in the control of goal-directed behavior. Pharmacological studies suggest that the NAcc may act in both instructive and permissive modes; however, previous electrophysiological studies  in behaving rats have reported firing patterns consistent with an instructive, but not permissive, role for NAcc neurons. We now report that a subset of NAcc neurons shows a long-lasting inhibition in firing rate whose onset precedes initiation of goal-directed sequences of behavior and terminates at the conclusion of the sequence. Together with data from previous behavioral studies,  this firing pattern suggests that, when active, these neurons tonically inhibit appetitive and consummatory behaviors and that, when inhibited, these neurons permissively gate those behaviors.", "12895518": "Projection neurons in the ventral striatum, the accumbens nucleus and olfactory tubercle, were examined by combining the retrograde tracing method and immunocytochemistry with antibodies against C-terminals of the preprodynorphin (PPD), preproenkephalin (PPE), preprotachykinin A (PPTA) and preprotachykinin B (PPTB). When the retrograde tracer was injected into the ventral pallidum, about  60% and 40% of retrogradely labeled neurons in the accumbens nucleus were immunoreactive for PPD and PPE, respectively. In contrast, all accumbens nucleus  neurons projecting to the ventral mesencephalic regions including the substantia  nigra and ventral tegmental area were immunopositive for PPD but not for PPE. Although no olfactory tubercle neurons projected fibers to the mesencephalic regions, 60% and 40% of olfactory tubercle neurons projecting to the ventrolateral portion of the ventral pallidum were immunoreactive for PPD and PPE, respectively, as were the accumbens nucleus neurons. About 70% of accumbens  nucleus and olfactory tubercle neurons projecting to the ventral pallidum and all accumbens nucleus neurons projecting to the ventral mesencephalic regions showed  PPTA immunoreactivity. A small population (2-12%) of accumbens neurons projecting to the ventral pallidum and mesencephalic regions displayed immunoreactivity for  PPTB. Compared with the dorsal striatopallidal projection neurons that were reported to mostly express PPE, it was characteristic of the ventral striatum that only the smaller population (about 40%) of ventral striatopallidal projection neurons expressed PPE. This suggests that the ventral striatopallidal  projection system is less specialized than the dorsal striatopallidal system in terms of peptide production, or that the ventral pallidum should be compared with a combined region of the globus pallidus and entopeduncular nucleus in the dorsal system.", "12786986": "This study demonstrates that microinjection of an AMPA/kainate glutamate antagonist elicits motivated fear and feeding behaviour mapped along rostrocaudal gradients of positive-to-negative valence in nucleus accumbens shell (similar to  rostrocaudal shell gradients recently reported for GABA agonist microinjections).

Another group received rostral or caudal microinjections of DNQX in nucleus accumbens core. Rostral shell DNQX microinjections potently increased appetitive food intake and established only weak conditioned place avoidance. Caudal shell DNQX microinjections elicited defensive treading behaviour, caused rats to defensively bite the experimenter and emit fearful distress vocalizations when handled, and established strong conditioned place avoidance. By contrast, no rostrocaudal gradients of motivational bivalence were produced by microinjections of the glutamate AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist DNQX into the core, or by microinjections of the NMDA antagonist MK-801 into the shell. Our results indicate that appetitive and aversive motivation is carried in anatomically differentiated channels by mesocorticolimbic glutamate signals to microcircuits in the medial shell.

To further test the hypothesis that  rostral shell muscimol microinjections produce positive motivational states, whereas caudal shell muscimol produces negative states, we measured behavioral place preference/avoidance conditioning and affective hedonic and aversive orofacial expressions of taste-elicited \"liking\" and \"disliking\" (gapes, etc.) in addition to fear and feeding behaviors. Farthest rostral muscimol microinjections (75 ng) caused increased eating behavior and also caused positive conditioned place preferences and increased positive hedonic reactions to the taste of sucrose. By contrast, caudal shell microinjections elicited negative defensive treading and caused robust negative conditioned place avoidance and negative aversive reactions to sucrose or quinine tastes. Intermediate rostral microinjections elicited effects of mixed positive/negative valence (positive appetitive eating behavior but negative place avoidance and negative taste reactions at mid-rostral sites, and sometimes positive eating simultaneously with fearful defensive treading more caudally).

Microinjections of a GABA(A) agonist (0, 25, 75, and 225 ng/0.5 microl muscimol) in rostral shell sites elicited appetitive increases in eating behavior. In contrast, microinjections in caudal shell sites elicited defensive burying or paw-treading  behavior. Rats whose microinjections landed bilaterally outside of the accumbens  shell did not display either behavior. Defensive treading elicited by caudal shell muscimol microinjection appeared to be a negative motivated response to threat (similar in parameters and orientation to normal defensive burying of a threatening electrified shock prod). The nucleus accumbens shell thus appears functionally heterogeneous in coding motivational valence. The demonstration that muscimol elicits positive eating behavior from rostral shell versus negative defensive behavior from caudal shell suggests in particular that GABAergic substrates of positive and negative types of motivated behavior in the nucleus accumbens shell are segregated along a rostrocaudal gradient.", "10415649": "Pennartz et al. have proposed that functions of the nucleus accumbens (NA) are subserved by the activity of ensembles of neurons rather than by an overall neuronal activation. Indeed, the NA is a site of convergence for a large number of inputs from limbic structures that may modulate the flow of prefrontal cortical information and contribute to defining such ensembles, as exemplified in the ability of hippocampal input to gate cortical throughput in the nucleus accumbens. NA neurons exhibit a bistable membrane potential, characterized by a very negative resting membrane potential (down state), periodically interrupted by plateau depolarizations (up state), during which the cells may fire in response to cortical inputs. A dynamic ensemble can be the result of a distributed set of neurons in their up state, determined by the moment-to-moment  changes in the spatial distribution of hippocampal inputs responsible for transitions to the up state. Ensembles may change as an adaptation to the contextual information provided by the hippocampal input. Furthermore, for dynamic ensembles to be functionally relevant, the model calls for near synchronous transitions to the up state in a group of neurons. This can be accomplished by the cell-to-cell transfer of information via gap junctions, a mechanism that can allow for a transfer of slow electrical signals, including \"up\" events between coupled cells. Furthermore, gap junction permeability is tightly modulated by a number of factors, including levels of dopamine and nitric oxide, and cortical inputs, allowing for fine-tuning of this synchronization of up events. The continuous selection of such dynamic ensembles in the NA may be disputed in schizophrenia, resulting in an inappropriate level of activity of thalamocortical systems.", "9630528": "The nucleus accumbens (Acb) of the rat has been divided immunohistochemically into shell and core, and further, it was subdivided into several portions in relation to functional significance.

In rostral Acb, the dorsomedial shell mainly projected to the dorsomedial ventral pallidum (VP), lateral hypothalamus (LH) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), while the ventromedial shell projected to the ventromedial VP, lateral preoptic area, LH and ventral tegmental area (VTA).

Furthermore, the ventromedial shell projected to the parabrachial nucleus (PB). The dorsomedial core projected to the dorsal VP, LH, SNc and SNr, and the ventral and lateral core sent axons to the dorsolateral VP,  GP and SNc.

Neurons were quantified in both the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens to estimate the proportion of neurons projecting to the ventral pallidum or ventral tegmental area that contain transcripts for D1 receptors, D2  receptors, beta-preprotachykinin or preproenkephalin. Following the deposition of FluoroGold into the central ventral pallidum, both the core and the shell of the  nucleus accumbens were retrogradely labelled, while deposits into the ventral tegmental area selectively labelled cells in the shell. A high percentage of nucleus accumbens neurons innervating the ventral tegmental area expressed messenger RNAs for D1 receptors (72%) and beta-preprotachykinin (62%), while less than 3% of the neurons contained messenger RNAs for preproenkephalin or D2 receptors. The neurons projecting to the ventral pallidum did not show the discrete distribution of transcripts as was observed in the accumbens-ventral tegmental area projection. Preproenkephalin messenger RNA was identified in 46% of the neurons innervating the ventral pallidum, and D2 receptor messenger RNA was found in approximately 40% of the cells. A large minority of neurons projecting from the nucleus accumbens to the ventral pallidum also expressed messenger RNAs for D1 receptors (37%) and beta-preprotachykinin (35%). While a higher percentage of D1 receptor, and beta-preprotachykinin messenger RNA expressing cells were located in the shell than in the core of the nucleus accumbens, the percentage tended to be higher in the core for cells expressing D2 receptors or preproenkephalin messenger RNA. These data indicate that messenger RNAs for D2 receptors and enkephalin are selectively expressed in the accumbens-pallidal projection while transcripts encoding D1 receptors and substance P are contained in the efferent projections to both the ventral pallidum and ventral tegmental area. The presence of D1 receptor and beta-preprotachykinin messenger RNAs in both mesencephalic and pallidal projections contrasts output from the striatum where the expression of D1 receptor and beta-preprotachykinin messenger RNAs is primarily restricted to the  mesencephalic projection.", "9151760": "We have demonstrated previously that injections of 6, 7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione into the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) elicits pronounced feeding in satiated rats. This glutamate antagonist blocks AMPA and kainate receptors and most likely increases food intake by disrupting a tonic excitatory input to the AcbSh, thus decreasing the firing rate of a population of local neurons. Because the application of GABA agonists also decreases neuronal activity, we hypothesized that administration of GABA agonists into the AcbSh would stimulate feeding in satiated rats. We found that acute inhibition of cells in the AcbSh via administration of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol or the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen elicited intense, dose-related feeding without altering water intake. Muscimol-induced feeding was blocked by coadministration of the selective GABAA receptor blocker bicuculline, but not by the GABAB receptor blocker saclofen. Conversely, baclofen-induced feeding was blocked by coadministration of saclofen, but was not affected by bicuculline. Furthermore, we found that increasing local levels of GABA by administration of a selective GABA-transaminase inhibitor, gamma-vinyl-GABA, elicited robust feeding in satiated rats, suggesting a physiological role for endogenous AcbSh GABA in the control of feeding. A mapping study showed that although some feeding can be elicited by muscimol injections near the lateral ventricles, the ventromedial AcbSh is the most sensitive site for eliciting feeding. These findings demonstrate that manipulation of GABA-sensitive cells in the AcbSh can have a pronounced, but specific, effect on feeding behavior in rats. They also constitute the initial description of a novel and potentially important component of the central mechanisms controlling food intake.", "7938546": "The nucleus accumbens as a complex of functionally distinct neuronal ensembles: an integration of behavioural, electrophysiological and anatomical data.", "7751934": "The interactions among excitatory inputs arising from the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, and innervating nucleus accumbens neurons were studied using in vivo intracellular recording techniques. Neurons recorded in the accumbens displayed one of three activity states: (1) silent, (2) spontaneously firing at low, constant rates, or (3) a bistable membrane potential, characterized by alternating periods of activity and silence occurring in concert with spontaneous transitions between two steady-state membrane potentials (average, -77.3 +/- 7.1 mV base, -63.0 +/- 7.4 mV plateau). These neurons also exhibited a high degree of convergence of responses elicited by stimulation of each of the three excitatory inputs tested. Activation of hippocampal afferents,  but not cortical, amygdaloid, or thalamic afferents, induced bistable cells to switch to the depolarized (active) state. In contrast, no bistable cells were encountered in the nucleus accumbens following an acute transection of the fornix. Furthermore, microinjection of lidocaine in the vicinity of the hippocampal afferents at the level of the fornix caused a reversible elimination  of the plateau phase in bistable cells. These data suggest that hippocampal input is necessary for accumbens neurons to enter a depolarized, active state. Furthermore, activation of prefrontal cortical inputs fail to evoke spike firing  in accumbens neurons unless they are in this active state. Consequently, the hippocampus appears to be capable of gating prefrontal corticoaccumbens throughput.", "7472436": "The nucleus accumbens in a brain region considered to be important in the regulation of appetitive behavior and reinforcement. The accumbens receives afferent input from corticolimbic and thalamic structures, which is primarily coded by excitatory amino acids (EAAs). The present studies investigated the role of EAA input to the nucleus accumbens in feeding behavior in rats, in two recently characterized subregions of the accumbens, the \"core\" and \"shell\". In the first series of experiments, it was shown that blockade of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate glutamate receptors in the medial part of the accumbens, corresponding to the medial shell subregion, resulted in a pronounced feeding response. Bilateral microinfusion of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX, 0.25-0.75 micrograms/0.5 microliters), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline (CNQX, 0.75-1.5 micrograms), and 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo-(F) quinoxaline (NBQX, 0.2-1.0 micrograms) markedly stimulated food intake immediately following infusion, in a dose-dependent manner. Infusion of DNQX into the central accumbens region, corresponding to the core, did not elicit feeding. Infusion of the NMDA antagonists 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5) and MK-801 (dizocilpine maleate) did not elicit feeding in either region. The feeding response to DNQX was blocked by local coinfusion of AMPA. Systemic pretreatment with naltrexone (5 mg/kg) had no effect on the DNQX-feeding response; however, prior systemic administration of both D-1 and D-2 antagonists reduced the response by half, suggesting a modulatory role for dopamine in the response. Moreover, the feeding  response was completely inhibited by concurrent infusion of the GABAA agonist muscimol (10, 25 ng) into the lateral hypothalamus, a major projection area of the accumbens shell. These findings demonstrate a selective role for non-NMDA receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell in ingestive behavior, and suggest an important functional link between two major brain regions involved in reward, the nucleus accumbens and lateral hypothalamus.", "6822855": "The anatomical organization and electrophysiological characteristics of a projection from the nucleus accumbens to anteroventral parts of the globus pallidus and to a subpallidal region that includes the substantia innominata (SI), the lateral preoptic area (LPO), and anterior parts of the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) were investigated in the rat. Autoradiographic experiments, with injections of 3H-proline into different sites in the nucleus accumbens and adjacent caudoputamen, indicate that the descending fibers are organized topographically along both mediolateral and dorsoventral gradients, although labeled fibers from adjacent regions of the nucleus accumbens overlap considerably in the ventral globus pallidus and subpallidal region. Injections confined to the caudoputaman only labeled fibers in the globus pallidus. Retrograde transport experiments with the marker true blue confirmed that only the nucleus accumbens projects to the subpallidal region and that the caudoputamen projects upon the glubus pallidus in a topographically organized manner. In electrophysiological recording experiments single pulse stimulation (0.1 to 0.7 mA; 0.15 msec duration) of the nucleus accumbens changed the discharge rate of single neurons in the ventral globus pallidus and in the SI, LPO, and LHA. Typically, the responses were inhibition of neuronal discharge with latencies of 6 to 18 msec. Single pulse stimulation of the dorsolateral caudoputamen altered the discharge rate of single neurons in dorsal regions of the globus pallidus, with inhibition being the most frequently observed response. The results of these anatomical and electrophysiological experiments are complementary and indicate that fibers from the nucleus accumbens innervate the anteroventral region of the globus pallidus as well as the subpallidal region, while most fibers of the caudoputamen innervate the globus pallidus but not the subpallidal region. It appears, therefore, that these two components of the striatum have different output connections. The possible functional significance  of these findings is discussed in relation to the projections of the subpallidal  region, which may include an output to the mesencephalic locomotor region, and in relation to the nucleus accumbens afferents from the amygdala and hippocampal formation.", "2057066": "The efferent projections of the core and shell areas of the nucleus accumbens were studied with a combination of anterograde and retrograde tract-tracing methods, including Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin, horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent tracers. Both the core and shell regions project to pallidal areas, i.e. ventral pallidum and entopeduncular nucleus, with a distinct topography in the sense that the core projection is located in the dorsolateral part of ventral pallidum, whereas the shell projects to the medial part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum. Both regions of the accumbens also project to mesencephalon with a bias for the core projection to innervate the substantia nigra-lateral mesencephalic tegmentum, and for the shell projection to reach primarily the ventral tegmental-paramedian tegmentum area. The most pronounced differences between core and shell projections exist in regard to the hypothalamus and extended amygdala. Whereas the core projects primarily to the entopeduncular nucleus including a part that invades the lateral hypothalamus, the shell, in addition, projects diffusely throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the lateral hypothalamus as well as to the extended amygdala, especially its sublenticular part. Both the core and shell of the accumbens have unmistakable striatal characteristics both histologically and in their connectional patterns. The shell, however, has additional features that are reminiscent of the recently described extended amygdala [Alheid G.F. and Heimer L. (1988) Neuroscience 27, 1-39; de Olmos J.S. et al. (1985) In The Rat Nervous System, pp. 223-334]; in fact, the possibility exists that the shell represents a transitional zone that seems to characterize most of the fringes of the striatal complex, where it adjoins the extended amygdala.", "1702109": "The striatopallidal projection originating in the nucleus accumbens was investigated by using anterograde transport of PHA-L in combination with peptide  immunohistochemistry in order to localize the injection sites and transported lectin with respect to neurochemically defined subterritories in the nucleus accumbens and subcommissural ventral pallidum. The results reported here supplement our previous observations, which indicated that the subcommissural ventral pallidum of the rat comprises two immunohistochemically defined subterritories (Zahm and Heimer, '88: J. Comp. Neurol., 272:516-535) which give rise to dichotomous downstream projection systems (Zahm, '89: Neuroscience, 30:33-50). The present data indicate that the neurotensin immunoreactivity-rich ventromedial district of ventral pallidum receives its accumbal input almost exclusively from the shell district of the nucleus accumbens. The accumbal core,  alternatively, projects to the dorsolateral ventral pallidal subterritory that lacks appreciable neurotensin immunoreactivity and in many other respects more resembles the adjoining striatopallidal components of the caudate-putamen. In addition to direct topographic relationships in the frontal plane among the accumbal injection sites and ventral pallidal terminations, it was observed that  more caudally placed core injections resulted in patches of striatopallidal terminations that were more caudally located in ventral pallidum. Shell injections, in contrast, produced columns of terminations that extended continuously from the rostralmost level that they appeared to the caudal end of ventromedial ventral pallidum. The accumbal shell, its exclusive projection to the ventromedial subterritory in the subcommissural ventral pallidum, and the previously reported, almost exclusive projection of that pallidal subdistrict to  the mesencephalic ventral tegmental area are discussed in terms of a number of other neurochemical and hodological features that serve to distinguish them sufficiently to suggest that they represent a uniquely specialized part of the basal ganglia.", "27239940": "Exposures to cocaine and morphine produce similar adaptations in nucleus accumbens (NAc)-based behaviors, yet produce very different adaptations at NAc excitatory synapses. In an effort to explain this paradox, we found that both drugs induced NMDA receptor-containing, AMPA receptor-silent excitatory synapses, albeit in distinct cell types through opposing cellular mechanisms. Cocaine selectively induced silent synapses in D1-type neurons, likely via a synaptogenesis process, whereas morphine induced silent synapses in D2-type neurons via internalization of AMPA receptors from pre-existing synapses. After drug withdrawal, cocaine-generated silent synapses became 'unsilenced' by recruiting AMPA receptors to strengthen excitatory inputs to D1-type neurons, whereas morphine-generated silent synapses were likely eliminated to weaken excitatory inputs to D2-type neurons. Thus, these cell type-specific, opposing mechanisms produced the same net shift of the balance between excitatory inputs to D1- and D2-type NAc neurons, which may underlie certain common alterations in  NAc-based behaviors induced by both classes of drugs.", "21967517": "Abstract Stress can have a lasting impact on the structure and function of brain  circuitry that results in long-lasting changes in the behavior of an organism. Synaptic plasticity is the mechanism by which information is stored and maintained within individual synapses, neurons, and neuronal circuits to guide the behavior of an organism. Although these mechanisms allow the organism to adapt to its constantly evolving environment, not all of these adaptations are beneficial. Under prolonged bouts of physical or psychological stress, these mechanisms become dysregulated, and the connectivity between brain regions becomes unbalanced, resulting in pathological behaviors. In this review, we highlight the effects of stress on the structure and function of neurons within the mesocorticolimbic brain systems known to regulate mood and motivation. We then discuss the implications of these spine adaptations on neuronal activity and pathological behaviors implicated in mood disorders. Finally, we end by discussing recent brain imaging studies in human depression within the context of these basic findings to provide insight into the underlying mechanisms leading to neural dysfunction in depression.", "17174602": "Addictive drugs share with palatable food the property of increasing extracellular dopamine (DA), preferentially in the nucleus accumbens shell rather than in the core. However, by acting directly on the brain, drugs bypass the adaptive mechanisms (habituation) that constrain the responsiveness of accumbens  shell DA to food reward, abnormally facilitating Pavlovian incentive learning and promoting the acquisition of abnormal DA-releasing properties by drug conditioned stimuli. Thus, whereas Pavlovian food conditioned stimuli release core but not shell DA, drug conditioned stimuli do the opposite, releasing shell but not core  DA. This process, which results in the acquisition of excessive incentive-motivational properties by drug conditioned stimuli, initiates the drug addiction process. Neuroadaptive processes related to the chronic influence of drugs on subcortical DA might secondarily impair the function of prefronto-striatal loops, resulting in impairments in impulse control and decision making that form the basis for the compulsive feature of drug seeking and its relapsing character.", "15034590": "Nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine is widely implicated in mediating the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. However, the precise function of the NAc itself in drug self-administration has been difficult to establish. Here we show  a neural double-dissociation of the behavioral processes that underlie cocaine self-administration in rats. Whereas selective excitotoxic lesions of the NAc core had only a minor effect on the acquisition of responding for cocaine under a standard schedule of continuous reinforcement, these lesions profoundly impaired  the acquisition of drug-seeking behavior that was maintained by drug-associated conditioned reinforcers and assessed using a second-order schedule of cocaine reinforcement. In contrast, selective excitotoxic lesions of the NAc shell did not impair drug self-administration or the acquisition of cocaine-seeking, but they did attenuate the psychostimulant effects of cocaine. These results further  our understanding of how the NAc controls drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior.", "10215912": "Repeated treatment with psychostimulant drugs produces changes in brain and behaviour that far outlast their initial neuropharmacological actions. The nature of persistent drug-induced neurobehavioural adaptations is of interest because they are thought to contribute to the development of dependence and addiction, and other forms of psychopathology, e.g. amphetamine psychosis. There are many reports that psychostimulants produce biochemical adaptations in brain monoamine  systems, especially dopamine systems. The purpose of the present study was to determine if they might also alter the morphology of neurons in brain regions that receive monoaminergic innervation. Rats were given repeated injections of either amphetamine or cocaine, or, to control for general motor activity, allowed access to a running wheel. They were then left undisturbed for 24-25 days before  their brains were processed for Golgi-Cox staining. Treatment with either amphetamine or cocaine (but not wheel running experience) increased the number of dendritic branches and the density of dendritic spines on medium spiny neurons in the shell of the nucleus accumbens, and on apical dendrites of layer V pyramidal  cells in the prefrontal cortex. Cocaine also increased dendritic branching and spine density on the basilar dendrites of pyramidal cells. In addition, both drugs doubled the incidence of branched spines on medium spiny neurons. It is suggested that some of the persistent neurobehavioural consequences of repeated exposure to psychostimulant drugs may be due to their ability to reorganize patterns of synaptic connectivity in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex.", "9204911": "The mechanism underlying dopamine D1 receptor-mediated attenuation of glutamatergic synaptic input to nucleus accumbens (NAcc) neurons was investigated in slices of rat forebrain, using whole-cell patch-clamp recording. The depression by dopamine of EPSCs evoked by single-shock cortical stimulation was stimulus-dependent. Synaptic activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors was critical for this effect, because dopamine-induced EPSC depressions were blocked  by the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist D/L-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5). Application of NMDA also depressed the EPSC, and both this effect and the  dopamine depressions were blocked by the A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), implicating adenosine release in the  EPSC depression. A1 receptor agonists also depressed EPSCs by a presynaptic action, causing increased paired-pulse facilitation, but this was insensitive to  AP5. Activation of D1 receptors enhanced both postsynaptic inward currents evoked by NMDA application and the isolated NMDA receptor-mediated component of synaptic transmission. The biochemical processes underlying the dopamine-induced EPSC depression did not involve either protein kinase A or the production of cAMP and  its metabolites, because this effect was resistant to the protein kinase inhibitors H89 and H7 and the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram. We conclude that activation of postsynaptic D1 receptors enhances the synaptic activation of NMDA receptors in nucleus accumbens neurons, thereby promoting a transsynaptic feedback inhibition of glutamatergic synaptic transmission via release of adenosine. Unusually for D1 receptors, this phenomenon occurs independently of adenylyl cyclase stimulation. This process may contribute to the locomotor stimulant action of dopaminergic agents in the NAcc.", "28275709": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to be a site of integration of positively  and negatively valenced information and action selection. Functional differentiation in valence processing has previously been found along the rostrocaudal axis of the shell region of the NAc in assessments of unconditioned  motivation. Given that the core region of the NAc has been implicated in the elicitation of motivated behavior in response to conditioned cues, we sought to assess the role of caudal, intermediate, and rostral sites within this subregion  in cue-elicited approach-avoidance decisions. Rats were trained to associate visuo-tactile cues with appetitive, aversive, and neutral outcomes. Following the successful acquisition of the cue-outcome associations, rats received microinfusions of GABAA and GABAB receptor agonists (muscimol/baclofen) or saline into the caudal, intermediate, or rostral NAc core and were then exposed to a superimposition of appetitively and aversively valenced cues versus neutral cues  in a \"conflict test,\" as well as to the appetitive versus neutral cues, and aversive cues versus neutral cues, in separate conditioned preference/avoidance tests. Disruption of activity in the intermediate to caudal parts of the NAc core resulted in a robust avoidance bias in response to motivationally conflicting cues, as well as a potentiated avoidance of aversive cues as compared with control animals, coupled with an attenuated conditioned preference for the appetitive cue. These results suggest that the caudal NAc core may have the capacity to exert bidirectional control over appetitively and aversively motivated responses to valence signals.", "26869075": "Prolonged mesolimbic dopamine concentration changes have been detected during spatial navigation, but little is known about the conditions that engender this signaling profile or how it develops with learning. To address this, we monitored dopamine concentration changes in the nucleus accumbens core of rats throughout acquisition and performance of an instrumental action sequence task. Prolonged dopamine concentration changes were detected that ramped up as rats executed each action sequence and declined after earned reward collection. With learning, dopamine concentration began to rise increasingly earlier in the execution of the sequence and ultimately backpropagated away from stereotyped sequence actions, becoming only transiently elevated by the most distal and unexpected reward predictor. Action sequence-related dopamine signaling was reactivated in well-trained rats if they became disengaged in the task and in response to an unexpected change in the value, but not identity of the earned reward. Throughout training and test, dopamine signaling correlated with sequence performance. These results suggest that action sequences can engender a prolonged mode of dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens core and that such signaling relates to elements of the motivation underlying sequence execution and is dynamic with learning, overtraining and violations in reward expectation.", "26323245": "It has been known for some time that nucleus accumbens dopamine (DA) is involved  in aspects of motivation , but theoretical approaches to understanding the functions of DA have continued to evolve based upon emerging data and novel concepts. Although it has become traditional to label DA neurons as \"reward\" neurons, the actual findings are more complicated than that, because they indicate that DA neurons can respond to a variety of motivationally significant stimuli. Moreover, it is important to distinguish between aspects of motivation that are differentially affected by dopaminergic manipulations. Studies that involve nucleus accumbens DA antagonism or depletion indicate that accumbens DA does not mediate primary food motivation or appetite. Nevertheless, DA is involved in appetitive and aversive motivational processes including behavioral activation , exertion of effort, sustained task engagement, and Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer. Interference with accumbens DA transmission affects instrumental behavior in a manner that interacts with the response requirements of the task and also shifts effort-related choice behavior, biasing  animals toward low-effort alternatives. Dysfunctions of mesolimbic DA may contribute to motivational symptoms seen in various psychopathologies, including  depression , schizophrenia, parkinsonism, and other disorders.", "25339748": "Approach to reward is a fundamental adaptive behavior, disruption of which is a core symptom of addiction and depression. Nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine is required for reward-predictive cues to activate vigorous reward seeking, but the  underlying neural mechanism is unknown. Reward-predictive cues elicit both dopamine release in the NAc and excitations and inhibitions in NAc neurons. However, a direct link has not been established between dopamine receptor activation, NAc cue-evoked neuronal activity, and reward-seeking behavior. Here,  we use a novel microelectrode array that enables simultaneous recording of neuronal firing and local dopamine receptor antagonist injection. We demonstrate  that, in the NAc of rats performing a discriminative stimulus task for sucrose reward, blockade of either D1 or D2 receptors selectively attenuates excitation,  but not inhibition, evoked by reward-predictive cues. Furthermore, we establish that this dopamine-dependent signal is necessary for reward-seeking behavior. These results demonstrate a neural mechanism by which NAc dopamine invigorates environmentally cued reward-seeking behavior.", "25258080": "Animal behaviors are reinforced by subsequent rewards following within a narrow time window. Such reward signals are primarily coded by dopamine, which modulates the synaptic connections of medium spiny neurons in the striatum. The mechanisms  of the narrow timing detection, however, remain unknown. Here, we optically stimulated dopaminergic and glutamatergic inputs separately and found that dopamine promoted spine enlargement only during a narrow time window (0.3 to 2 seconds) after the glutamatergic inputs. The temporal contingency was detected by rapid regulation of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate in thin distal dendrites, in which protein-kinase A was activated only within the time window because of a high phosphodiesterase activity. Thus, we describe a molecular basis of reinforcement plasticity at the level of single dendritic spines.", "24705184": "Drug addiction is a neuropsychiatric disorder marked by escalating drug use. Dopamine neurotransmission in the ventromedial striatum (VMS) mediates acute reinforcing effects of abused drugs, but with protracted use the dorsolateral striatum is thought to assume control over drug seeking. We measured striatal dopamine release during a cocaine self-administration regimen that produced escalation of drug taking in rats. Surprisingly, we found that phasic dopamine decreased in both regions as the rate of cocaine intake increased, with the decrement in dopamine in the VMS significantly correlated with the rate of escalation. Administration of the dopamine precursor L-DOPA at a dose that replenished dopamine signaling in the VMS reversed escalation, thereby demonstrating a causal relationship between diminished dopamine transmission and  excessive drug use. Together these data provide mechanistic and therapeutic insight into the excessive drug intake that emerges following protracted use.", "24259575": "The direct and indirect efferent pathways from striatum ultimately reconverge to  influence basal ganglia output nuclei, which in turn regulate behavior via thalamocortical and brainstem motor circuits. However, the distinct contributions of these two efferent pathways in shaping basal ganglia output are not well understood. We investigated these processes using selective optogenetic control of the direct and indirect pathways, in combination with single-unit recording in the basal ganglia output nucleus substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) in mice.  Optogenetic activation of striatal direct and indirect pathway projection neurons produced diverse cellular responses in SNr neurons, with stimulation of each pathway eliciting both excitations and inhibitions. Despite this response heterogeneity, the effectiveness of direct pathway stimulation in producing movement initiation correlated selectively with the subpopulation of inhibited SNr neurons. In contrast, effective indirect pathway-mediated motor suppression was most strongly influenced by excited SNr neurons. Our results support the theory that key basal ganglia output neurons serve as an inhibitory gate over motor output that can be opened or closed by striatal direct and indirect pathways, respectively.", "23933141": "Certain Pavlovian conditioned stimuli (CSs) paired with food unconditioned stimuli (USs) come to elicit approach and even consumption-like behaviors in rats (sign-tracking). We investigated the effects of lesions of the nucleus accumbens  core (ACbC) or shell (ACbS) on the acquisition of sign-tracking in a discriminative autoshaping procedure in which presentation of one lever CS was followed by delivery of sucrose, and another was not. Although we previously found that bilateral lesions of the whole ACb disrupted the initial acquisition of sign-tracking, neither ACbC or ACbS lesions affected the rate or percentage of trials in which rats pressed the CS+. In addition, detailed video analysis showed no effect of either lesion on the topography of the sign-tracking conditioned response (CR). These and other results from lesion studies of autoshaping contrast with those from previous sign-tracking experiments that used purely visual cues (Parkinson et al., 2000a,b), suggesting that the neural circuitry involved in assigning incentive value depends upon the nature of the CS.", "23764290": "A key function of the nucleus accumbens is to promote vigorous reward seeking, but the corresponding neural mechanism has not been identified despite many years of research. Here, we study cued flexible approach behavior, a form of reward seeking that strongly depends on the accumbens, and we describe a robust, single-cell neural correlate of behavioral vigor in the excitatory response of accumbens neurons to reward-predictive cues. Well before locomotion begins, this  cue-evoked excitation predicts both the movement initiation latency and the speed of subsequent flexible approach responses, but not those of stereotyped, inflexible responses. Moreover, the excitation simultaneously signals the subject's proximity to the approach target, a signal that appears to mediate greater response vigor on trials that begin with the subject closer to the target. These results demonstrate a neural mechanism for response invigoration whereby accumbens neuronal encoding of reward availability and target proximity together drive the onset and speed of reward-seeking locomotion.", "23426680": "Dopamine is highly implicated both as a teaching signal in reinforcement learning and in motivating actions to obtain rewards. However, theoretical disconnects remain between the temporal encoding properties of dopamine neurons and the behavioral consequences of its release. Here, we demonstrate in rats that dopamine evoked by Pavlovian cues increases during acquisition, but dissociates from stable conditioned appetitive behavior as this signal returns to preconditioning levels with extended training. Experimental manipulation of the statistical parameters of the behavioral paradigm revealed that this attenuation  of cue-evoked dopamine release during the postasymptotic period was attributable  to acquired knowledge of the temporal structure of the task. In parallel, conditioned behavior became less dopamine dependent after extended training. Thus, the current work demonstrates that as the presentation of reward-predictive stimuli becomes anticipated through the acquisition of task information, there is a shift in the neurobiological substrates that mediate the motivational properties of these incentive stimuli.", "23141060": "Nucleus accumbens dopamine is known to play a role in motivational processes, and dysfunctions of mesolimbic dopamine may contribute to motivational symptoms of depression and other disorders, as well as features of substance abuse. Although  it has become traditional to label dopamine neurons as \"reward\" neurons, this is  an overgeneralization, and it is important to distinguish between aspects of motivation that are differentially affected by dopaminergic manipulations. For example, accumbens dopamine does not mediate primary food motivation or appetite, but is involved in appetitive and aversive motivational processes including behavioral activation, exertion of effort, approach behavior, sustained task engagement, Pavlovian processes, and instrumental learning. In this review, we discuss the complex roles of dopamine in behavioral functions related to motivation.", "22780554": "The role of dopamine in reward is a topic of debate. For example, some have argued that phasic dopamine signaling provides a prediction-error signal necessary for stimulus-reward learning, whereas others have hypothesized that dopamine is not necessary for learning per se, but for attributing incentive motivational value ('incentive salience') to reward cues. These psychological processes are difficult to tease apart, because they tend to change together. To  disentangle them we took advantage of natural individual variation in the extent  to which reward cues are attributed with incentive salience, and asked whether dopamine (specifically in the core of the nucleus accumbens) is necessary for the expression of two forms of pavlovian-conditioned approach behavior--one in which  the cue acquires powerful motivational properties (sign-tracking) and another closely related one in which it does not (goal-tracking). After acquisition of these conditioned responses (CRs), intra-accumbens injection of the dopamine receptor antagonist flupenthixol markedly impaired the expression of a sign-tracking CR, but not a goal-tracking CR. Furthermore, dopamine antagonism did not produce a gradual extinction-like decline in behavior, but maximally impaired expression of a sign-tracking CR on the very first trial, indicating the effect was not due to new learning (i.e. it occurred in the absence of new prediction-error computations). The data support the view that dopamine in the accumbens core is not necessary for learning stimulus-reward associations, but for attributing incentive salience to reward cues, transforming predictive conditional stimuli into incentive stimuli with powerful motivational properties.", "22469749": "Initially-neutral cues paired with rewards are thought to acquire motivational significance, as if the incentive motivational value of the reward is transferred to the cue. Such cues may serve as secondary reinforcers to establish new learning, modulate the performance of instrumental action (Pavlovian-instrumental transfer, PIT), and be the targets of approach and other cue-directed behaviors.  Here we examined the effects of lesions of the ventral striatal nucleus accumbens (ACb) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) on the acquisition of discriminative autoshaped lever-pressing in rats. Insertion of one lever into the experimental chamber was reinforced by sucrose delivery, but insertion of another lever was not reinforced. Although sucrose was delivered independently of the rats' behavior, sham-lesioned rats rapidly came to press the reinforced but not the nonreinforced lever. Bilateral ACb lesions impaired the initial acquisition of sign-tracking but not its terminal levels. In contrast, BLA lesions produced substantial deficits in terminal levels of sign-tracking. Furthermore, whereas ACb lesions primarily affected the probability of lever press responses, BLA lesions mostly affected the rate of responding once it occurred. Finally, disconnection lesions that disrupted communication between ACb and BLA produced both sets of deficits. We suggest that ACb is important for initial acquisition of consummatory-like responses that incorporate hedonic aspects of the reward, while BLA serves to enhance such incentive salience once it is acquired.", "21704115": "The purpose of this review is to describe the molecular mechanisms in the striatum that mediate reward-based learning and action control during instrumental conditioning. Experiments assessing the neural bases of instrumental conditioning have uncovered functional circuits in the striatum, including dorsal and ventral striatal sub-regions, involved in action-outcome learning, stimulus-response learning, and the motivational control of action by reward-associated cues. Integration of dopamine (DA) and glutamate neurotransmission within these striatal sub-regions is hypothesized to enable learning and action control through its role in shaping synaptic plasticity and cellular excitability. The extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) appears to be particularly important for reward-based learning and action control due to its sensitivity to combined DA and glutamate receptor activation and its involvement  in a range of cellular functions. ERK activation in striatal neurons is proposed  to have a dual role in both the learning and performance factors that contribute  to instrumental conditioning through its regulation of plasticity-related transcription factors and its modulation of intrinsic cellular excitability. Furthermore, perturbation of ERK activation by drugs of abuse may give rise to behavioral disorders such as addiction.", "21150898": "Individuals make choices and prioritize goals using complex processes that assign value to rewards and associated stimuli. During Pavlovian learning, previously neutral stimuli that predict rewards can acquire motivational properties, becoming attractive and desirable incentive stimuli. However, whether a cue acts  solely as a predictor of reward, or also serves as an incentive stimulus, differs between individuals. Thus, individuals vary in the degree to which cues bias choice and potentially promote maladaptive behaviour. Here we use rats that differ in the incentive motivational properties they attribute to food cues to probe the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in stimulus-reward learning. We show that intact dopamine transmission is not required for all forms of learning  in which reward cues become effective predictors. Rather, dopamine acts selectively in a form of stimulus-reward learning in which incentive salience is  assigned to reward cues. In individuals with a propensity for this form of learning, reward cues come to powerfully motivate and control behaviour. This work provides insight into the neurobiology of a form of stimulus-reward learning that confers increased susceptibility to disorders of impulse control.", "12445721": "The involvement of mesoaccumbens dopamine in adaptive learning and behaviour is unclear. For example, dopamine may act as a teaching signal to enable learning, or more generally modulate the behavioural expression, or selection, of an already-learned response. The present study investigated the involvement of the mesoaccumbens dopamine system in a fundamental form of learning: Pavlovian conditioning. In this case, the temporal association of a previously neutral visual stimulus and a biologically significant unconditioned stimulus (US), subsequently led to the production of the conditioned response (CR) of discriminated approach behaviour directed toward the conditioned stimulus (CS+),  relative to a control (CS-) stimulus. 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), leading to approximately 80% reductions in tissue dopamine, were made at varying time points in four experimental groups of rats, either before or subsequent to the acquisition of the CR. NAcc dopamine depletion produced long-term neuroadaptations in dopamine function 2 months after surgery,  and profoundly impaired discriminated Pavlovian approach regardless of when the lesion was made. Thus, NAcc dopamine not only plays a role in conditioned behavioural activation, but also in making the appropriate discriminated response i.e. the direction of response. Further, acquisition lesions produced a far greater impact on discriminated approach than performance lesions. This difference in lesion-induced impairment implies that mesoaccumbens dopamine may play differential roles in the learning and performance of preparatory Pavlovian  conditioning.", "12445716": "Dopamine (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) respond to a wide category of salient stimuli. Activation of SN and VTA DA  neurons, and consequent release of nigrostriatal and mesolimbic DA, modulates the processing of concurrent glutamate inputs to dorsal and ventral striatal target regions. According to the view described here, this occurs under conditions of unexpected environmental change regardless of whether that change is rewarding or aversive. Nigrostriatal and mesolimbic DA activity gates the input of sensory, motor, and incentive motivational (e.g. reward) signals to the striatum. In light of recent single-unit and brain imaging data, it is suggested that the striatal reward signals originate in the orbitofrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala (BLA), regions that project strongly to the striatum. A DA signal of salient unexpected event occurrence, from this framework, gates the throughput of the orbitofrontal glutamate reward input to the striatum just as it gates the throughput of corticostriatal sensory and motor signals needed for normal response execution. Processing of these incoming signals is enhanced when synaptic DA levels are high, because DA enhances the synaptic efficacy of strong  concurrent glutamate inputs while reducing the efficacy of weak glutamate inputs. The impairments in motor performance and incentive motivational processes that follow from nigrostriatal and mesolimbic DA loss can be understood in terms of a  single mechanism: abnormal processing of sensorimotor and incentive motivation-related glutamate input signals to the striatum.", "11717381": "Stimuli paired with primary rewards can acquire emotional valence and the ability to elicit automatic, Pavlovian approach responses that have been shown to be mediated by the nucleus accumbens. The present experiment investigated the effects of infusions of glutamatergic or dopaminergic receptor antagonists into the core of the nucleus accumbens on the acquisition and performance of Pavlovian discriminated approach to an appetitive conditioned stimulus. Rats were trained on an autoshaping task in which a conditioned stimulus (CS+; a lever) was inserted into the operant chamber for 10 sec, after which a food pellet was delivered. Presentation of another lever (CS-) was never followed by food. Subjects developed a conditioned response of approaching and contacting the CS+ selectively, although food delivery was not in any way contingent on the animals' response. A triple dissociation in the effects of AP-5, LY293558 [(3SR, 4aRS, 6RS, 8aRS)-6-[2-(iH-tetrazol-5-yl)ethyl]-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroiso-quinoline- 3-carboxylic acid], and alpha-flupenthixol infused into the nucleus accumbens core on the acquisition and performance of this conditioned response was observed. The AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist LY293558 disrupted discriminated approach performance but not acquisition, as evidenced by increased approaches to the CS-. In contrast, the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 impaired only the acquisition, but not performance, of autoshaping whereas the dopamine D1/D2 receptor antagonist alpha-flupenthixol decreased approaches to the CS+ during both acquisition and performance. The data are discussed with reference to dissociable interactions of these receptor types with limbic cortical and dopaminergic afferents to the nucleus accumbens core during the acquisition and expression of Pavlovian conditioned approach.", "10718261": "The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) has been implicated in a variety of forms of reward-related learning, reflecting its anatomical connections with limbic cortical structures. After confirming that excitotoxic lesions of the anterior cingulate cortex (Ant Cing) impaired the acquisition of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in an autoshaping procedure, the effects of excitotoxic lesions to the NAcc core or shell on autoshaping were also assessed. Only selective core lesions impaired Pavlovian approach. A subsequent experiment studied the effects  of a disconnection of the Ant Cing and NAcc core, using an asymmetric lesion procedure, to determine whether these structures interact sequentially as part of a limbic corticostriatal system. Such lesioned rats were also significantly impaired relative to controls at autoshaping. These results demonstrate that the  NAcc core and Ant Cing are \"nodes\" of a corticostriatal circuit involved in stimulus-reward learning.", "8425943": "The efferent connections of the rostral pole of the rat accumbens, where distinct core and shell subterritories can not be identified, were examined with the aid of the anterogradely transported plant lectin, Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), for comparison with the previously reported projection patterns of the accumbal core and shell. Injection sites and transported PHA-L were evaluated with the aid of reference to adjacent sections processed to display substance P or calbindin 28 kD immunoreactivities, i.e., markers that demonstrate the core and shell. Lateral parts of the rostral pole gave rise to a \"core-like\" projection system that involved the rostroventral globus pallidus, subcommissural ventral pallidum, entopeduncular nucleus and an adjacent part of the lateral hypothalamus, lateral ventral tegmental area, dorsal pars compacta, and structures in the lateral mesencephalic tegmentum and central grey. The medial part of the rostral pole gave rise to a \"shell-like\" innervation of the subcommissural ventral pallidum, lateral preoptic region, lateral hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, dorsalmost pars compacta, retrorubral field, lateral midbrain tegmentum, and central grey. In contrast to the large numbers of axon varicosities observed through the entire length of lateral hypothalamus following shell injections, dense accumulations of axon collaterals and varicosities in hypothalamus were limited to the levels of origin of the stria medullaris bundle  and entopeduncular nucleus and to the posterlateral region following medial injections. The medial part of the rostral pole contributed some projections to preoptic and sublenticular regions, but not to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Noteworthy concentrations of calbindin immunoreactive cells observed  in the lateral rostral pole correlate with the origin of the \"basal ganglia-like\" projection system, provoking the speculation that ventral striatal calbindin immunoreactive cells contribute principally to basal ganglia-like projections while cells lacking calbindin immunoreactivity contribute to the innervation of hypothalamus and midbrain tegmentum.", "21368124": "Signaling through N-methyl-D-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) is essential for the development of behavioral sensitization to psychostimulants such as amphetamine (AMPH). However, the cell type and brain region in which NMDAR signaling is required for AMPH sensitization remain unresolved. Here we use selective inactivation of Grin1, the gene encoding the essential NR1 subunit of NMDARs, in dopamine neurons or their medium spiny neuron (MSN) targets, to address this issue. We show that NMDAR signaling in dopamine neurons is not required for behavioral sensitization to AMPH. Conversely, removing NMDARs from MSNs that express the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) significantly attenuated AMPH sensitization, and conditional, virus-mediated restoration of NR1 in D1R neurons  in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of these animals rescued sensitization. Interestingly, sensitization could also be restored by virus-mediated inactivation of NR1 in all remaining neurons in the NAc of animals lacking NMDARs on D1R neurons, or by removing NMDARs from all MSNs. Taken together, these data indicate that unbalanced loss of NMDAR signaling in D1R MSNs alone prevents AMPH  sensitization, whereas a balanced loss of NMDARs from both D1R and dopamine D2 receptor-expressing (D2R) MSNs is permissive for sensitization.", "21131952": "Dorsal striatum is important for the development of drug addiction; however, a precise understanding of the roles of striatopallidal (indirect) and striatonigral (direct) pathway neurons in regulating behaviors remains elusive. Using viral-mediated expression of an engineered G protein-coupled receptor (hM(4)D), we found that activation of hM(4)D receptors with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) potently reduced striatal neuron excitability. When hM(4)D receptors were selectively expressed in either direct or indirect pathway neurons, CNO did not change acute locomotor responses to amphetamine, but did alter behavioral plasticity associated with repeated drug treatment. Specifically, transiently disrupting striatopallidal neuronal activity facilitated behavioral sensitization, whereas decreasing excitability of striatonigral neurons impaired  its persistence. These findings suggest that acute drug effects can be parsed from the behavioral adaptations associated with repeated drug exposure and highlight the utility of this approach for deconstructing neuronal pathway contributions to behavior.", "11252991": "Studies of human addicts and behavioural studies in rodent models of addiction indicate that key behavioural abnormalities associated with addiction are extremely long lived. So, chronic drug exposure causes stable changes in the brain at the molecular and cellular levels that underlie these behavioural abnormalities. There has been considerable progress in identifying the mechanisms that contribute to long-lived neural and behavioural plasticity related to addiction, including drug-induced changes in gene transcription, in RNA and protein processing, and in synaptic structure. Although the specific changes identified so far are not sufficiently long lasting to account for the nearly permanent changes in behaviour associated with addiction, recent work has pointed to the types of mechanism that could be involved.", "24239129": "BACKGROUND: Chronic methamphetamine (METH) exposure causes neuroadaptations at glutamatergic synapses. METHODS: To identify the METH-induced epigenetic underpinnings of these neuroadaptations, we injected increasing METH doses to rats for 2 weeks and measured striatal glutamate receptor expression. We then quantified the effects of METH exposure on histone acetylation. We also measured METH-induced changes in DNA methylation and DNA hydroxymethylation. RESULTS: Chronic METH decreased transcript and protein expression of GluA1 and GluA2 alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR)  and GluN1 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits. These changes were associated with altered electrophysiological glutamatergic responses in striatal neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-polymerase chain reaction revealed that METH decreased enrichment of acetylated histone H4 on GluA1, GluA2, and GluN1 promoters. Methamphetamine exposure also increased repressor element-1 silencing  transcription factor (REST) corepressor 1, methylated CpG binding protein 2, and  histone deacetylase 2 enrichment, but not of sirtuin 1 or sirtuin 2, onto GluA1 and GluA2 gene sequences. Moreover, METH caused interactions of REST corepressor  1 and methylated CpG binding protein 2 with histone deacetylase 2 and of REST with histone deacetylase 1. Surprisingly, methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and  hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation-polymerase chain reaction revealed METH-induced decreased enrichment of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at GluA1 and GluA2 promoter sequences. Importantly, the histone deacetylase inhibitor, valproic acid, blocked METH-induced decreased expression of AMPAR and  N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits. Finally, valproic acid also attenuated METH-induced decrease H4K16Ac recruitment on AMPAR gene sequences. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that histone H4 hypoacetylation may be the main determinant of METH-induced decreased striatal glutamate receptor expression.", "21708909": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that modulate gene expression by binding target mRNAs. The hundreds of miRNAs expressed in the brain are critical for synaptic development and plasticity. Drugs of abuse cause lasting changes in the limbic regions of the brain that process reward, and addiction is viewed as a form of aberrant neuroplasticity. Using next-generation sequencing, we cataloged miRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens and at striatal synapses in control and chronically cocaine-treated mice. We identified cocaine-responsive miRNAs, synaptically enriched and depleted miRNA families, and confirmed cocaine-induced  changes in protein expression for several predicted synaptic target genes. The miR-8 family, known for its roles in cancer, is highly enriched and cocaine regulated at striatal synapses, where its members may affect expression of cell adhesion molecules. Synaptically enriched cocaine-regulated miRNAs may contribute to long-lasting drug-induced plasticity through fine-tuning regulatory pathways that modulate the actin cytoskeleton, neurotransmitter metabolism, and peptide hormone processing.", "20613834": "Cocaine addiction is characterized by a gradual loss of control over drug use, but the molecular mechanisms regulating vulnerability to this process remain unclear. Here we report that microRNA-212 (miR-212) is upregulated in the dorsal  striatum of rats with a history of extended access to cocaine. Striatal miR-212 decreases responsiveness to the motivational properties of cocaine by markedly amplifying the stimulatory effects of the drug on cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) signalling. This action occurs through miR-212-enhanced Raf1 activity, resulting in adenylyl cyclase sensitization and increased expression of the essential CREB co-activator TORC (transducer of regulated CREB; also known as CRTC). Our findings indicate that striatal miR-212 signalling has a key role in determining vulnerability to cocaine addiction, reveal new molecular regulators that control the complex actions of cocaine in brain reward circuitries and provide an entirely new direction for the development of anti-addiction therapeutics based on the modulation of noncoding RNAs.", "11120394": "This paper reviews recent developments in the neurocircuitry and neurobiology of  addiction from a perspective of allostasis. A model is proposed for brain changes that occur during the development of addiction that explain the persistent vulnerability to relapse long after drug-taking has ceased. Addiction is presented as a cycle of spiralling dysregulation of brain reward systems that progressively increases, resulting in the compulsive use and loss of control over drug-taking. The development of addiction recruits different sources of reinforcement, different neuroadaptive mechanisms, and different neurochemical changes to dysregulate the brain reward system. Counteradaptive processes such as opponent-process that are part of normal homeostatic limitation of reward function fail to return within the normal homeostatic range and are hypothesized  to form an allostatic state. Allostasis from the addiction perspective is defined as the process of maintaining apparent reward function stability by changes in brain reward mechanisms. The allostatic state represents a chronic deviation of reward set point and is fueled not only by dysregulation of reward circuits per se, but also by the activation of brain and hormonal stress responses. The manifestation of this allostatic state as compulsive drug-taking and loss of control over drug-taking is hypothesized to be expressed through activation of brain circuits involved in compulsive behavior such as the cortico-striatal-thalamic loop. The view that addiction is the pathology that results from an allostatic mechanism using the circuits established for natural rewards provides a realistic approach to identifying the neurobiological factors  that produce vulnerability to addiction and relapse.", "26214370": "It is widely accepted that D1 dopamine receptor-expressing striatal neurons convey their information directly to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia, whereas D2-expressing neurons do so indirectly via pallidal neurons. Combining optogenetics and electrophysiology, we found that this architecture does not apply to mouse nucleus accumbens projections to the ventral pallidum. Thus, current thinking attributing D1 and D2 selectivity to accumbens projections akin  to dorsal striatal pathways needs to be reconsidered.", "21076424": "Synaptic modifications in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are important for adaptive  and pathological reward-dependent learning. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs), the major cell type in the NAc, participate in two parallel circuits that subserve distinct behavioral functions, yet little is known about differences in their electrophysiological and synaptic properties. Using bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice, we found that synaptic activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors in NAc MSNs in the indirect, but not direct, pathway led to the production of endocannabinoids, which activated presynaptic CB1 receptors to trigger endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD)  as well as postsynaptic transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels to trigger a form of LTD resulting from endocytosis of AMPA receptors. These results reveal a previously unknown action of TRPV1 channels and indicate that the postsynaptic generation of endocannabinoids can modulate synaptic strength in a cell type-specific fashion by activating distinct pre- and postsynaptic targets.", "20147549": "Striatal GABAergic microcircuits are critical for motor function, yet their properties remain enigmatic due to difficulties in targeting striatal interneurons for electrophysiological analysis. Here, we use Lhx6-GFP transgenic  mice to identify GABAergic interneurons and investigate their regulation of striatal direct- and indirect-pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs). We find that the two major interneuron populations, persistent low-threshold spiking (PLTS) and fast spiking (FS) interneurons, differ substantially in their excitatory inputs and inhibitory outputs. Excitatory synaptic currents recorded from PLTS interneurons are characterized by a small, nonrectifying AMPA receptor-mediated component and a NMDA receptor-mediated component. In contrast, glutamatergic synaptic currents in FS interneurons have a large, strongly rectifying AMPA receptor-mediated component, but no detectable NMDA receptor-mediated responses.  Consistent with their axonal morphology, the output of individual PLTS interneurons is relatively weak and sparse, whereas FS interneurons are robustly  connected to MSNs and other FS interneurons and appear to mediate the bulk of feedforward inhibition. Synaptic depression of FS outputs is relatively insensitive to firing frequency, and dynamic-clamp experiments reveal that these  short-term dynamics enable feedforward inhibition to remain efficacious across a  broad frequency range. Surprisingly, we find that FS interneurons preferentially  target direct-pathway MSNs over indirect-pathway MSNs, suggesting a potential mechanism for rapid pathway-specific regulation of striatal output pathways.", "19386907": "We previously reported greater GABAA receptor-mediated tonic currents in D2+ striatopallidal than D1+ striatonigral medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are mediated by alpha5-subunit-containing receptors. Here, we used whole-cell recordings in slices from bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice to investigate the link between subunit composition, phosphorylation, and dopamine receptor activation. Whole-cell recordings in slices from delta-subunit knock-out mice demonstrate that while MSNs in wild-type mice do express delta-subunit-containing receptors, this receptor subtype is not responsible for tonic conductance observed in the acute slice preparation. We assessed the contribution of the beta1- and beta3-subunits expressed in MSNs by their sensitivity to etomidate, an agonist selective for beta2- or beta3-subunit-containing GABAA receptors. Although etomidate produced substantial tonic current in D2+ neurons, there was no effect in D1+ neurons. However, with internal PKA application or dopamine modulation, D1+ neurons expressed tonic conductance and responded to etomidate application. Our results suggest that distinct phosphorylation of beta3-subunits  may cause larger tonic current in D2+ striatopallidal MSNs, and proper intracellular conditions can reveal tonic current in D1+ cells.", "18945889": "Principal medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) of the striatum have long been thought to be homogeneous in their somatodendritic morphology and physiology. Recent work using transgenic mice, in which the two major classes of MSN are labeled, has challenged this assumption. To explore the basis for this difference, D(1) and D(2) receptor-expressing MSNs (D(1) and D(2) MSNs) in brain  slices from adult transgenic mice were characterized electrophysiologically and anatomically. These studies revealed that D(1) MSNs were less excitable than D(2) MSNs over a broad range of developmental time points. Although M(1) muscarinic receptor signaling was a factor, it was not sufficient to explain the dichotomy between D(1) and D(2) MSNs. Reconstructions of biocytin-filled MSNs revealed that the physiological divergence was paralleled by a divergence in total dendritic area. Experimentally grounded simulations suggested that the dichotomy in MSN dendritic area was a major contributor to the dichotomy in electrophysiological properties. Thus, rather than being an intrinsically homogenous population, striatal MSNs have dichotomous somatodendritic properties that mirror differences in their network connections and biochemistry.", "18337395": "Author information:  (1)Center for Translational Neuroscience, Division of Neurology, Neurotransgenic  Core Facility, and Department of Neurobiology, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.", "18234896": "Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) provide the principal output for the dorsal striatum. Those that express dopamine D2 receptors (D2+) project to the globus pallidus external and are thought to inhibit movement, whereas those that express dopamine D1 receptors (D1+) project to the substantia nigra pars reticulata and are thought to facilitate movement. Whole-cell and outside-out patch recordings in slices from bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice examined the role of  GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents in dopamine receptor D1+ striatonigral and D2+ striatopallidal MSNs. Although inhibitory synaptic currents were similar between  the two neuronal populations, D2+ MSNs showed greater GABA(A) receptor-mediated tonic currents. TTX application abolished the tonic current to a similar extent as GABA(A) antagonists, suggesting a synaptic origin of the ambient GABA. Low GABA concentrations produced larger whole-cell responses and longer GABA channel  openings in D2+ than in D1+ MSNs. Recordings from MSNs in alpha1-/- mice and pharmacological analysis of tonic currents suggested greater expression of alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors in D2+ than in D1+ MSNs.

Studies of the cellular organization of the neostriatum have focused upon the spiny projection neurones, which represent the vast majority of neurones, but the identity and functions of interneurones in this structure have  remained enigmatic despite decades of study. Recently, the discovery of cytochemical markers that are specific for each of the major classes of striatal  interneurones, and the combination of this with intracellular recording and staining, has revealed the identities of interneurones and some of their functional characteristics in a way that could not have been imagined by the classical morphologists. These methods also suggest some possible modes of action of interneurones in the neostriatal circuitry.", "7790919": "Many of the nonlinear membrane properties displayed by neostriatal spiny projection neurons are conferred by their voltage-gated potassium (K+) currents,  including an inwardly rectifying current (IKir), fast (IAt), and slowly (IAs)-inactivating A-currents, and a slow, noninactivating current. The relative  contribution of these K+ currents to the pronounced inward and outward rectification of the current-voltage (I-V) relationship of spiny neurons was investigated in a neostriatal slice preparation. Manipulation of the equilibrium  potential for K+ (EK) showed that the voltage dependence of activation of inward  rectification was identical to that of IKir. In addition, application of barium (100 microM), which is known to reduce IKir in a time- and voltage-dependent manner, had equivalent effects on inward rectification. Subsequent application of cesium (3 mM) or tetraethylammonium (TEA, 25 mM) blocked inward rectification in  a solely voltage-dependent fashion consistent with the action of these blockers on IKir. Administration of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 100 microM) at concentrations that selectively depress IAs, reduced outward rectification of spiny neurons at subthreshold membrane potentials. Higher concentrations of 4-AP (2 mM), which block both IAs and IAt, revealed an early transient overshoot in voltage deflections at potentials near spike threshold, but rectification persisted at the end of the responses. The transient overshoot and the residual rectification  were eliminated by TEA (25 mM), a blocker of the slow, noninactivating K+ current. Collectively, these results indicate that all three depolarization-activated K+ currents contribute to outward rectification at different times and membrane potentials defined by their voltage dependence of activation and kinetics of inactivation. The spontaneous activity of neostriatal  spiny neurons recorded in intact animals is characterized by sustained and limited shifts in membrane potential from relatively hyperpolarized potentials to depolarized potentials near spike threshold. The present data suggest that the hyperpolarized state is determined principally by IKir and the limits on the depolarized state are defined by IAf, IAs, and the noninactivating current. These outward K+ currents also are hypothesized to govern the spike discharge characteristics once the depolarized state has been reached.", "1383869": "The somatodendritic morphology of projection neurons in the shell and core of the rat nucleus accumbens was studied. These cells were retrogradely labelled with Fast Blue from the ventral mesencephalon (substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area) and subsequently injected intracellularly with Lucifer Yellow and processed immunocytochemically. Digitized reconstructions revealed that the cell bodies of  neurons located throughout the nucleus are small-to-medium in size. Neurons in the shell have significantly fewer dendritic arbours with fewer branch segments,  fewer terminal segments, and lower spine densities than those in the core. Values for the same parameters are significantly greater for cells in lateral than in medial parts of the shell but the same for neurons located within and without enkephalin enriched parts of the core, with an exception of spine density being significantly greater in the enkephalin-rich compartment. Calculations based on these data reveal that neurons in the core have as much as 50% more surface area  than those in the shell, which suggests that core neurons have a greater potential for collecting synaptic information than have shell cells.

High-throughput sequencings of microRNA and mRNA in the medial prefrontal cortices were performed in CUMS-induced depression mice versus control mice to demonstrate the molecular  profiles of major depression. In the medial prefrontal cortices of depression-like mice, the levels of mRNAs that translated the proteins for the GABAergic synapses, dopaminergic synapses, myelination, synaptic vesicle cycle and neuronal growth were downregulated. miRNAs of regulating these mRNAs are upregulated.

In this review, we outline the functional dissociation of NAc D1- and D2-expressing neurons of the basal ganglia in reward and aversive learning, as well as drug addiction. These studies have revealed the importance of activation  of NAc D1 receptors for reward learning and drug addiction, and inactivation of NAc D2 receptors for aversive learning and flexibility.

A  chronically stressful life in genetically susceptible individuals is presumably the major etiology that leads to dysfunctions of monoamine and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. These pathogenic factors cause neuron atrophy in the limbic system for major depressive disorder. Cell-specific pathophysiology is unclear, so we investigated prelimbic cortical GABAergic neurons and their interaction with glutamatergic neurons in depression-like mice. METHODS: Mice were treated with chronic unpredictable mild stress for 3 weeks until they expressed depression-like behaviors confirmed by sucrose preference, Y-maze, and forced swimming tests. The structures and functions of GABAergic and  glutamatergic units in prelimbic cortices were studied by cell imaging and electrophysiology in chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depression mice vs controls. RESULTS: In depression-like mice, prelimbic cortical GABAergic neurons show incoordination among the subcellular compartments, such as decreased excitability and synaptic outputs as well as increased reception from excitatory inputs. GABAergic synapses on glutamatergic cells demonstrate decreased presynaptic innervation and increased postsynaptic responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced incoordination in prelimbic cortical GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons dysregulates their target  neurons, which may be the pathological basis for depressive mood.

METHODS: K252a (tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) antagonist), U0126 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation inhibitor), LY294002 (serine-threonine kinase (Akt) phosphorylation inhibitor), or vehicle was given intracerebroventricularly to mice in each group 30\u00a0min before 7-CTKA or vehicle intraperitoneal injection. Behavioral changes were observed by sucrose preference test and miRNA microarray was performed to examine hippocampal miRNAs levels in mice. Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted to further confirm results in microarray  study. RESULTS: 7-CTKA not only reversed the decrease in sucrose preference and multiple hippocampal miRNAs changes induced by CUMS but also mediated 15 common miRNAs via TrkB-ERK/Akt pathways. Among them, the expression levels of four miRNAs (miR-34a-5p, miR-200a-3p, miR-144-3p, miR-1894-5p) were validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The findings from qRT-PCR study support results from microarray analysis except for the non-significance of miR-1894-5p expression. CONCLUSIONS: This demonstrated that the 15 miRNA targets shared by TrkB-ERK/Akt pathways might participate in rapid-acting molecular mechanism of antidepressant  7-CTKA.", "23493706": "Increased fear memory generalization is associated with posttraumatic stress disorder, but the circuit mechanisms that regulate memory specificity remain unclear. Here, we define a neural circuit-composed of the medial prefrontal cortex, the nucleus reuniens (NR), and the hippocampus-that controls fear memory  generalization. Inactivation of prefrontal inputs into the NR or direct silencing of NR projections enhanced fear memory generalization, whereas constitutive activation of NR neurons decreased memory generalization. Direct optogenetic activation of phasic and tonic action-potential firing of NR neurons during memory acquisition enhanced or reduced memory generalization, respectively. We propose that the NR determines the specificity and generalization of memory attributes for a particular context by processing information from the medial prefrontal cortex en route to the hippocampus.", "22785313": "Chronic stress is a strong diathesis for depression in humans and is used to generate animal models of depression. It commonly leads to several major symptoms of depression, including dysregulated feeding behaviour, anhedonia and behavioural despair. Although hypotheses defining the neural pathophysiology of depression have been proposed, the critical synaptic adaptations in key brain circuits that mediate stress-induced depressive symptoms remain poorly understood. Here we show that chronic stress in mice decreases the strength of excitatory synapses on D1 dopamine receptor-expressing nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons owing to activation of the melanocortin 4 receptor. Stress-elicited increases in behavioural measurements of anhedonia, but not increases in measurements of behavioural despair, are prevented by blocking these melanocortin 4 receptor-mediated synaptic changes in vivo. These results establish that stress-elicited anhedonia requires a neuropeptide-triggered, cell-type-specific synaptic adaptation in the nucleus accumbens and that distinct circuit adaptations mediate other major symptoms of stress-elicited depression.", "22525486": "In some patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), individual illness characteristics appear consistent with those of a neuroprogressive illness. Features of neuroprogression include poorer symptomatic, treatment and functional outcomes in patients with earlier disease onset and increased number and length of depressive episodes. In such patients, longer and more frequent depressive episodes appear to increase vulnerability for further episodes, precipitating an  accelerating and progressive illness course leading to functional decline. Evidence from clinical, biochemical and neuroimaging studies appear to support this model and are informing novel therapeutic approaches. This paper reviews current knowledge of the neuroprogressive processes that may occur in MDD, including structural brain consequences and potential molecular mechanisms including the role of neurotransmitter systems, inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress pathways, neurotrophins and regulation of neurogenesis, cortisol and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis modulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and epigenetic and dietary influences. Evidence-based novel treatments informed by this knowledge are discussed.", "21996102": "Depression is associated with structural alterations in limbic brain regions that control emotion and mood. Studies of chronic stress in animal models and postmortem tissue from depressed subjects demonstrate that these structural alterations result from atrophy and loss of neurons and glial cells. These findings indicate that depression and stress-related mood disorders can be considered mild neurodegenerative disorders. Importantly, there is evidence that  these structural alterations can be blocked or even reversed by elimination of stress and by antidepressant treatments. A major focus of current investigations  is to characterize the molecular signaling pathways and factors that underlie these effects of stress, depression, and antidepressant treatment. Recent advances in this research area are discussed and potential novel targets for antidepressant development are highlighted.", "21799487": "A major impediment to novel drug development has been the paucity of animal models that accurately reflect symptoms of affective disorders. In animal models, prolonged social stress has proven to be useful in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying affective-like disorders. When considering experimental approaches for studying depression, social defeat stress, in particular, has been shown to have excellent etiological, predictive, discriminative and face validity. Described here is a protocol whereby C57BL/6J mice that are repeatedly  subjected to bouts of social defeat by a larger and aggressive CD-1 mouse results in the development of a clear depressive-like syndrome, characterized by enduring deficits in social interactions. Specifically, the protocol consists of three important stages, beginning with the selection of aggressive CD-1 mice, followed  by agonistic social confrontations between the CD-1 and C57BL/6J mice, and concluding with the confirmation of social avoidance in subordinate C57BL/6J mice. The automated detection of social avoidance allows a marked increase in throughput, reproducibility and quantitative analysis. This protocol is highly adaptable, but in its most common form it requires 3-4 weeks for completion.", "20861369": "Relapse to drug seeking was studied using a rodent model of reinstatement induced by exposure to drug-related cues. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell growth and survival by controlling translation in response to nutrients and growth factors, has been demonstrated to be involved in neuronal adaptations that underlie drug addiction  and learning and memory. We investigated the potential role of the mTOR signaling pathway in relapse to cocaine seeking by using the cue-induced reinstatement model in self-administering rats. We found that exposure to a cocaine-related cue induced reinstatement to cocaine seeking and increased phosphorylation of p70s6 kinase (p70s6k) and ribosomal protein s6 (rps6), measures of mTOR activity, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core but not shell. Furthermore, inhibition of NAc core but not shell p70s6k and rps6 phosphorylation by rapamycin decreased cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Finally, stimulation of NAc core p70s6k and rps6 phosphorylation by NMDA enhanced cue-induced reinstatement, an effect reversed by rapamycin pretreatment. Additionally, rapamycin infusion into  the NAc core or shell did not alter ongoing cocaine self-administration or cue-induced reinstatement of sucrose seeking. These findings indicate that cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking is mediated by activation of the mTOR signaling pathway in the NAc core.", "20831892": "The multifaceted concept of impulsivity implies that different impulsivity aspects, mediated by different neural processes, influence behavior at different  levels. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key component of the neural processes regulating impulsivity. In this review, we discuss the findings of lesion studies in animals and functional imaging studies in humans focusing on the role of the NAc in impulsivity. Evidence supports that the extent and pattern of involvement  of the NAc, and its subregions, the core and the shell, vary among different facets of impulsivity. Data from imaging studies reviewed in this article suggest the involvement of the ventral striatum/NAc in impulsive choice. Findings of animal studies indicate that lesions of the NAc core subregion facilitated impulsivity in tasks involving intertemporal choice, and promoted a risk-averse,  less impulsive, tendency in tasks involving options with probability differences. Modification of neurotransmitter activity, especially of dopamine, which is proposed to underlie the changes observed in functional imaging studies, has been shown to influence afferent input pattern in the NAc and the generation of the behavioral output. Parameters of behavioral tasks reflecting response inhibition  function are altered by neurochemical interventions and local electrical stimulation in both the core and the shell subregions. In toto, NAc's pattern of  neuronal activity, either genetically determined or acquired, has a critical impact on the interindividual variation in the expression of impulsivity. Nevertheless, the NAc is not the only substrate responsible for impulsivity and it is not involved in each facet of impulsivity to the same extent.", "20708038": "Homeostatic response is an endowed self-correcting/maintaining property for living units, ranging from subcellular domains, single cells, and organs to the whole organism. Homeostatic responses maintain stable function through the ever-changing internal and external environments. In central neurons, several forms of homeostatic regulation have been identified, all of which tend to stabilize the functional output of neurons toward their prior \"set-point.\" Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) within the forebrain region the nucleus accumbens (NAc) play a central role in gating/regulating emotional and motivational behaviors including craving and seeking drugs of abuse. Exposure to highly salient stimuli  such as cocaine administration not only acutely activates a certain population of NAc MSNs, but also induces long-lasting changes in these neurons. It is these long-lasting cellular alterations that are speculated to mediate the increasingly strong cocaine-craving and cocaine-seeking behaviors. Why do the potentially powerful homeostatic mechanisms fail to correct or compensate for these drug-induced maladaptations in neurons? Based on recent experimental results, this review proposes a hypothesis of homeostatic dysregulation induced by exposure to cocaine. Specifically, we hypothesize that exposure to cocaine generates false molecular signals which misleads the homeostatic regulation process, resulting in maladaptive changes in NAc MSNs. Thus, many molecular and cellular alterations observed in the addicted brain may indeed result from homeostatic dysregulation. This review is among the first to introduce the concept of homeostatic neuroplasticity to understanding the molecular and cellular maladaptations following exposure to drugs of abuse.", "20664582": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a critical component of the reward circuitry, and  dysfunction of the NAc may account for anhedonia and other symptoms of depression. Here, we investigated whether alterations in endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling in the NAc contribute to depression-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) in mice. We compared three types of eCB/CB1 receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in slices prepared from the NAc core of control and stress-exposed mice: depolarization-induced suppression of excitation, long-term depression, and the depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) induced by group I metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist DHPG. CUS (5-6-week exposure to stressors), but not sub-CUS (1 week exposure to stressors), induces depression-like behaviors and impairs these  forms of eCB/CB1 receptor-mediated plasticity examined in the NAc core. Neither sub-CUS nor CUS altered the tissue contents of the eCBs, anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol in the striatum. However, exposure to CUS, but not to sub-CUS, attenuated the depression of fEPSPs induced by the CB1 receptor agonist  WIN 55\u2009212-2. CUS exposure reduced the maximal effect without affecting the EC(50) of WIN 55\u2009212-2 to induce fEPSP depression. Thus, impaired CB1 receptor function could account for CUS-induced deficiency in eCB signaling in the NAc. Both CUS-induced deficiency in eCB signaling and depression-like behaviors were reversed by in vivo administration of antidepressant fluoxetine. These results suggest that downregulation of eCB signaling in the NAc occurs after CUS and contributes to the pathophysiology of depression.", "20473292": "In contrast with the many studies of stress effects on the brain, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms of resilience, the ability of some individuals to escape the deleterious effects of stress. We found that the transcription factor DeltaFosB mediates an essential mechanism of resilience in mice. Induction of DeltaFosB in the nucleus accumbens, an important brain reward-associated region, in response to chronic social defeat stress was both necessary and sufficient for resilience. DeltaFosB induction was also required for the standard antidepressant fluoxetine to reverse behavioral pathology induced by social defeat. DeltaFosB produced these effects through induction of the GluR2 AMPA glutamate receptor subunit, which decreased the responsiveness of  nucleus accumbens neurons to glutamate, and through other synaptic proteins. Together, these findings establish a previously unknown molecular pathway underlying both resilience and antidepressant action.", "20207024": "Addictive drugs cause persistent restructuring of several neuronal cell types in  the limbic regions of brain thought to be responsible for long-term behavioral plasticity driving addiction. Although these structural changes are well documented in nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons, little is known regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms. Additionally, it remains unclear whether structural plasticity and its synaptic concomitants drive addictive behaviors or  whether they reflect homeostatic compensations to the drug not related to addiction per se. Here, we discuss recent paradoxical data, which either support  or oppose the hypothesis that drug-induced changes in dendritic spines drive addictive behavior. We define areas where future investigation can provide a more detailed picture of drug-induced synaptic reorganization, including ultrastructural, electrophysiological and behavioral studies.", "17851537": "Increasing evidence demonstrates that neuroplasticity, a fundamental mechanism of neuronal adaptation, is disrupted in mood disorders and in animal models of stress. Here we provide an overview of the evidence that chronic stress, which can precipitate or exacerbate depression, disrupts neuroplasticity, while antidepressant treatment produces opposing effects and can enhance neuroplasticity. We discuss neuroplasticity at different levels: structural plasticity (such as plastic changes in spine and dendrite morphology as well as adult neurogenesis), functional synaptic plasticity, and the molecular and cellular mechanisms accompanying such changes. Together, these studies elucidate  mechanisms that may contribute to the pathophysiology of depression. Greater appreciation of the convergence of mechanisms between stress, depression, and neuroplasticity is likely to lead to the identification of novel targets for more efficacious treatments.", "17404375": "The ability to form associations between predictive environmental events and rewarding outcomes is a fundamental aspect of learned behavior. This apparently simple ability likely requires complex neural processing evolved to identify, seek, and use natural rewards and redirect these activities based on updated sensory information. Emerging evidence from both animal and human research suggests that this type of processing is mediated in part by the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and a closely associated network of brain structures. The NAc is  required for a number of reward-related behaviors and processes specific information about reward availability, value, and context. In addition, this structure is critical for the acquisition and expression of most Pavlovian stimulus-reward relationships, and cues that predict rewards produce robust changes in neural activity in the NAc. Although processing within the NAc may enable or promote Pavlovian reward learning in natural situations, it has also been implicated in aspects of human drug addiction, including the ability of drug-paired cues to control behavior. This article provides a critical review of  the existing animal and human literature concerning the role of the NAc in Pavlovian learning with nondrug rewards and considers some clinical ture concerning the role of the NAc in Pavlovian learning with nondrug implications of these findings.", "15691526": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies of postmortem neurochemical markers in severe psychiatric disorders have been carried out on different brain collections, making it difficult to compare results. METHODS: One hundred RNA, protein, and other neurochemical markers were assessed  in a single set of 60 postmortem brains (15 each with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression without psychosis, and unaffected control subjects) in relation to seven neurochemical systems. Quantitative measures of continuous variables for prefrontal, hippocampus, anterior cingulate, superior temporal cortex, or a combination of these were analyzed from published and unpublished studies by 56 research groups. RESULTS: Before correcting for multiple comparisons, 23% of markers (23/100) were abnormal in one or more regions, with most indicating decreased expression. The largest percentage were associated with the developmental/synaptic (10/22) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA; 3/7) systems. Bipolar disorder (20) and schizophrenia (19) had the most abnormalities, with a 65% overlap. When all brain areas were considered together and corrected for multiple comparisons, reelin, parvalbumin, and GAD67 were the most abnormal. CONCLUSIONS: Confirming other studies, the GABA and developmental/synaptic neurochemical systems are promising areas for research on schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Research should include tissue from both diseases, and additional brain areas should be assessed.", "15661623": "According to the dopamine (DA) hypothesis of reward, DA systems in the brain, particularly in the nucleus accumbens, are thought to directly mediate the rewarding or primary motivational characteristics of natural stimuli such as food, water and sex, as well as various drugs of abuse. However, there are numerous problems associated with this hypothesis. Interference with accumbens DA transmission does not substantially blunt primary motivation for natural rewards  such as food, but it does disrupt the propensity of animals to engage in effortful responding to obtain food. Electrophysiological and voltammetric studies indicate that novel stimuli, conditioned stimuli that predict reward, and instrumental behaviors that deliver natural rewards all act to stimulate DA activity. Accumbens DA acts as a modulator of several functions related to motivated behavior, and can influence normal and pathological cognitive function, activational aspects of motivation, anergia or psychomotor slowing in depression, the impact of conditioned stimuli, plasticity and a variety of sensorimotor functions.", "11846609": "The two most commonly used methods to analyze data from real-time, quantitative PCR experiments are absolute quantification and relative quantification. Absolute quantification determines the input copy number, usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative quantification relates the PCR signal of the target transcript in a treatment group to that of another sample such as an untreated control. The 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method is a convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The purpose of this report is to present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method. In addition, we present the derivation and applications of two variations of the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method that may be useful in the analysis of real-time, quantitative PCR data.", "27266915": "Compared with men, women show enhanced responses to drugs of abuse, and consequently are thought to be more vulnerable to addiction. The ovarian hormone  estradiol has emerged as a key facilitator in the heightened development of addiction in females. These actions of estradiol appear mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5). However, the downstream effectors of this ER/mGluR5 signaling pathway are unknown. Here we investigate whether cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) activation is  a part of the mechanism whereby estradiol influences behavioral and synaptic correlates of addiction. Following repeated cocaine administration, estradiol-treated ovariectomized rats exhibited both sensitized locomotor responses and decreases in the dendritic spine density of nucleus accumbens core  medium-spiny neurons in comparison to oil-treated controls. Both effects of estradiol were blocked by AM251, a CB1R inverse agonist. These results indicate that part of the signaling mechanism through which estradiol impacts behavioral and synaptic correlates of addiction in female rats requires activation of CB1Rs.", "26772794": "The purpose of this review is to discuss ways to think about and study sex differences in preclinical animal models. We use the framework of addiction, in which animal models have excellent face and construct validity, to illustrate the importance of considering sex differences. There are four types of sex differences: qualitative, quantitative, population, and mechanistic. A better understanding of the ways males and females can differ will help scientists design experiments to characterize better the presence or absence of sex differences in new phenomena that they are investigating. We have outlined major  quantitative, population, and mechanistic sex differences in the addiction domain using a heuristic framework of the three established stages of the addiction cycle: binge/intoxication, withdrawal/negative affect, and preoccupation/anticipation. Female rats, in general, acquire the self-administration of drugs and alcohol more rapidly, escalate their drug taking with extended access more rapidly, show more motivational withdrawal, and (where  tested in animal models of \"craving\") show greater reinstatement. The one exception is that female rats show less motivational withdrawal to alcohol. The bases for these quantitative sex differences appear to be both organizational, in that estradiol-treated neonatal animals show the male phenotype, and activational, in that the female phenotype depends on the effects of gonadal hormones. In animals, differences within the estrous cycle can be observed but are relatively minor. Such hormonal effects seem to be most prevalent during the  acquisition of drug taking and less influential once compulsive drug taking is established and are linked largely to progesterone and estradiol. This review emphasizes not only significant differences in the phenotypes of females and males in the domain of addiction but emphasizes the paucity of data to date in our understanding of those differences.", "26647972": "The sex-steroid hormone estradiol (E2) enhances the psychoactive effects of cocaine, as evidenced by clinical and preclinical studies. The medial preoptic area (mPOA), a region in the hypothalamus, is a primary neural locus for neuroendocrine integration, containing one of the richest concentrations of estrogen receptors in the CNS and also has a key role in the regulation of naturally rewarding behaviors. However, whether estradiol enhances the neurochemical response to cocaine by acting in the mPOA is still unclear. Using neurotoxic lesions and microdialysis, we examined whether the mPOA modulates cocaine-induced neurochemical activity in the nucleus accumbens. Tract tracing and immunohistochemical staining were used to determine whether projections from  the mPOA to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are sensitive to estrogen signaling. Finally, estradiol microinjections followed by microdialysis were used to determine whether estrogenic signaling in the mPOA modulates cocaine-induced changes of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. Results showed that lesions of the  mPOA or microinjections of estradiol directly into the mPOA increased cocaine-induced release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the mPOA modulates cocaine responsiveness via projections  to both dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons in the VTA, and that these projections are sensitive to estrogenic stimulation. Taken together, these findings point to  a novel estradiol-dependent pathway that modulates cocaine-induced neurochemical  activity in the mesolimbic system.", "26122294": "This article is part of a Special Issue \"Estradiol and cognition\". Over the past  30 years, research has demonstrated that estrogens not only are important for female reproduction, but also play a role in a diverse array of cognitive functions. Originally, estrogens were thought to have only one receptor, localized exclusively to the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. However, it is now known that there are at least three estrogen receptors (ERs): ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2 and G-protein coupled ER1 (GPER1). In addition to being localized to nuclei, ER\u03b1 and  ER\u03b2 are localized to the cell membrane, and GPER1 is also observed at the cell membrane. The mechanism through which ERs are associated with the membrane remains unclear, but palmitoylation of receptors and associations between ERs and caveolin are implicated in membrane association. ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are mostly observed  in the nucleus using light microscopy unless they are particularly abundant. However, electron microscopy has revealed that ERs are also found at the membrane in complimentary distributions in multiple brain regions, many of which are innervated by dopamine inputs and were previously thought to contain few ERs. In  particular, membrane-associated ERs are observed in the prefrontal cortex, dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus, all of which are involved in learning and memory. These findings provide a mechanism for the rapid effects of  estrogens in these regions. The effects of estrogens on dopamine-dependent cognition likely result from binding at both nuclear and membrane-associated ERs, so elucidating the localization of membrane-associated ERs helps provide a more complete understanding of the cognitive effects of these hormones.", "24878822": "Accumulating evidence from human and rodent studies suggests that females are more sensitive to the motivating and rewarding properties of drugs of abuse. Numerous reports implicate estradiol in enhancing drug-related responses in females, yet the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this effect of estradiol are unknown. Because dendritic spine plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is linked to the addictive effects of drugs, we examined the influence of estradiol  on dendritic spines in this region. Previously our laboratory demonstrated that in female medium spiny neurons, estradiol activates metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype five (mGluR5), a G protein-coupled receptor already implicated in the etiology of drug addiction. Thus, we sought to determine whether mGluR5 is a part of the mechanism by which estradiol affects dendritic spine density in the NAc. To test this hypothesis, ovariectomized female rats were treated with the mGluR5 antagonist, MPEP, or vehicle prior to estradiol (or oil) treatment and 24\u00a0h later dendritic spine density was evaluated by DiI labeling and confocal microscopy. We found that estradiol decreased dendritic spine density in the NAc  core and that pretreatment with MPEP blocked this effect. In contrast, MPEP had no effect on dendritic spine density in the NAc shell or CA1 region of the hippocampus, two regions in which estradiol increased the density of dendritic spines. As dendritic spine plasticity in the NAc core has behavioral consequences for drug addiction, these data provide a clue as to how estradiol acts in females to enhance behavioral responses to drugs of abuse.", "21510962": "Human and animal studies indicate that drugs of abuse affect males and females differently, but the mechanism(s) underlying sex differences are unknown. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is central in the neural circuitry of addiction and medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc show drug-induced changes in morphology and physiology including increased dendritic spine density. We previously showed  in drug-na\u00efve rats that MSN dendritic spine density is higher in females than males. In this study, we investigated sex differences in the effects of cocaine on locomotor activity as well as MSN dendritic spine density and excitatory synaptic physiology in rats treated for 5 weeks followed by 17-21 days of abstinence. Females showed a greater locomotor response to cocaine and more robust behavioral sensitization than males. Spine density was also higher in females and, particularly in the core of the NAc, the magnitude of the cocaine-induced increase in spine density was greater in females. Interestingly,  in cocaine-treated females but not males, cocaine-induced behavioral activation during treatment was correlated with spine density measured after treatment. Miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency in core MSNs also was higher in females, and increased with cocaine in both the core and shell of females more than males. We  found no differences in mEPSC amplitude or paired-pulse ratio of evoked EPSCs, suggesting that sex differences and cocaine effects on mEPSC frequency reflect differences in excitatory synapse number per neuron rather than presynaptic release probability. These studies are the first to demonstrate structural and electrophysiological differences between males and females that may drive sex differences in addictive behavior.", "20709161": "Along with its ability to directly regulate gene expression, estradiol influences cell signaling and brain functions via rapid, membrane-initiated events. In the female rat striatum, estradiol activates membrane-localized estrogen receptors to influence synaptic neurotransmission, calcium channel activity, and behaviors related to motor control. Yet, the mechanism by which estradiol acts to rapidly affect striatal physiology has remained elusive. Here we find that membrane estrogen receptors (ERs) couple to the metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR5 and mGluR3, providing the framework to understand how membrane estrogen receptors affect striatal function. Using CREB phosphorylation as a downstream measure of ER/mGluR activation, membrane-localized estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) activates mGluR5 signaling to mediate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent CREB phosphorylation. Further, ER\u03b1 and estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2) activate mGluR3  to attenuate L-type calcium channel-dependent CREB signaling. Interestingly, while this fundamental mechanism of ER/mGluR signaling was initially characterized in hippocampal neurons, estrogen receptors in striatal neurons are  paired with a different set of mGluRs, resulting in the potential to functionally isolate membrane-initiated estrogen signaling across brain regions via use of specific mGluR modulators. These results provide both a mechanism for the rapid actions of estrogens within the female striatum, as well as demonstrate that estrogen receptors can interact with a more diverse set of surface membrane receptors than previously recognized.", "20026119": "A consistent finding in drug abuse research is that males and females show differences in their response to drugs of abuse. In women, increased plasma estradiol is associated with increased vulnerability to the psychostimulant and reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. Our laboratory has focused on the role of  estradiol in modulating the response to cocaine. We have seen that ovariectomy increases the locomotor response to a single cocaine injection, whereas estradiol exacerbates the locomotor response to repeated cocaine administration. Cocaine-induced sensitization of brain activity, as measured by fMRI, is also dependent on plasma estradiol. Moreover, we observed that although all ovariectomized rats show conditioned place preference to cocaine, it is more robust in ovariectomized rats with estradiol. Opioid receptors are enriched in brain regions associated with pleasure and reward. We find that in females, the effectiveness of kappa opioid agonists in decreasing the locomotor response to repeated cocaine varies with plasma estradiol. We also find that estradiol regulates the density of mu opioid receptors in brains areas associated with reward. These data hint that in females, estradiol modulates the behavioral effects of cocaine by regulating mu and kappa opioid signaling in mesocorticolimbic brain structures. Identifying the mechanisms that mediate differences in vulnerability to drugs of abuse may lead to effective therapeutic  strategies for the treatment and prevention of addiction and relapse.

Antipsychotic drugs activate similar signaling proteins in the striatum by blocking dopamine D(2) receptors (D2Rs). However, the neurons in which these pathways are activated by psychotropic drugs are not precisely identified. We used transgenic mice, in which enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression was driven by D1R promoter (drd1a-EGFP) or D2R promoter (drd2-EGFP). We confirmed the expression of drd1a-EGFP in striatonigral and drd2-EGFP in striatopallidal neurons. Drd2-EGFP was also expressed in cholinergic interneurons, whereas no expression of either promoter was detected in GABAergic interneurons. Acute cocaine treatment increased phosphorylation of ERK and its direct or indirect nuclear targets, mitogen- and stress-activated kinase-1 (MSK1) and histone H3, exclusively in D1R-expressing output neurons in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens. Cocaine-induced expression of c-Fos and Zif268 predominated in D1R-expressing neurons but was also observed in D2R-expressing neurons. One week after repeated  cocaine administration, cocaine-induced signaling responses were decreased, with  the exception of enhanced ERK phosphorylation in dorsal striatum. The responses remained confined to D1R neurons. In contrast, acute haloperidol injection activated phosphorylation of ERK, MSK1, and H3 only in D2R neurons and induced c-fos and zif268 predominantly in these neurons. Our results demonstrate that cocaine and haloperidol specifically activate signaling pathways in two completely segregated populations of striatal output neurons, providing direct evidence for the selective mechanisms by which these drugs exert their long-term  effects.", "16309717": "Estradiol was previously reported to increase striatal D(2) receptor density. The following experiments investigated the contribution of each estrogen receptor in  estradiol modulation of D(2) receptors. Ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats were treated for 2 weeks with an agonist for ERalpha, 4,4',4''-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)trisphenol (PPT), an agonist for ERbeta, 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) and compared to estradiol treatment. Ovariectomy decreased D(2) agonist and antagonist striatal binding sites, specific binding was measured using [(3)H]quinpirole and [(3)H]spiperone.  Estradiol prevented this decrease, while DPN but not PPT mimicked the estradiol increase of D(2) receptor specific binding. In the nucleus accumbens, ovariectomy decreased [(3)H]quinpirole specific binding in the core and left the shell unchanged. Similarly, estradiol and DPN but not PPT prevented this decrease. Neither ovariectomy nor treatments affected [(3)H]spiperone specific binding in this area. In the olfactory tubercle, neither ovariectomy nor treatments changed  D(2) receptor binding. Finally, both ovariectomy and treatments did not affect D(2L), D(2S) mRNA and D(2L)/D(2S) ratios measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The present results show, for the first time, that an ERbeta agonist treatment modulates D(2) receptors and suggest that ERbeta is involved in the estradiol modulation of D(2) receptors.", "8158125": "The ability of estrogen to modulate mesolimbic dopamine (DA) was examined using in vivo voltammetry. Estrogen priming (5 micrograms, 48 h) of ovariectomized (ovx) female rats resulted in a slight decrease in K(+)-stimulated DA release measured in the nucleus accumbens: this decrease was accompanied by a significant increase in both DA reuptake and DA clearance times. Following estrogen priming nomifensine, a potent inhibitor of the DA uptake carrier, was still able to potentiate K(+)-stimulated DA release and alter the time course of DA availability, but the response was attenuated compared with ovx controls. Direct  infusion of 17 beta-estradiol hemisuccinate (17 beta-E, 20-50 pg) into the nucleus accumbens resulted in a biphasic potentiation of K(+)-stimulated release. An initial increase in release was observed 2 min after 17 beta-E infusion; this  increase, although reduced by 15 min, was still significantly higher than control values. A subsequent potentiation was observed 60 min after the initial 17 beta-E infusion; this response remained for at least an additional 60 min. Nomifensine did not significantly alter K(+)-stimulated DA release following 17 beta-E infusion, but was still able to potentiate the total time DA was available extracellularly. These data suggest that the mesolimbic A10 DA neurons that terminate in the nucleus accumbens can be modulated in vivo by estrogen and that  this modulation may be mediated by both genomic (long term) and nongenomic (short term) mechanisms.", "1631058": "Chronic treatment of rats with cocaine leads to long-term biochemical changes in  the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region implicated in mediating the reinforcing effects of cocaine and other drugs of abuse. Immediate early genes (IEGs) and their protein products appear to play an important role in transducing extracellular stimuli into altered patterns of cellular gene expression and, therefore, into long-term changes in cellular functioning. We therefore examined  changes in the mRNA levels for the IEGs c-fos, c-jun, fosB, junB, and zif268 in the NAc of rats treated acutely and chronically with cocaine. A single cocaine injection increased the mRNA levels of all of the IEGs examined. Following chronic cocaine treatment, however, IEG expression had returned to control levels and was not significantly increased following a further acute challenge with cocaine, suggesting desensitization in the ability of cocaine to induce these IEGs. Similarly, levels of Fos-like immunoreactivity, which are increased in the  NAc by acute cocaine, were reduced to control levels in chronic cocaine-treated rats. Fos, Jun, and a number of related proteins activate or repress transcription of genes by binding to DNA response elements called AP-1 sites. As  would be expected from the RNA data and immunohistochemistry, acute cocaine administration increased AP-1 binding activity in the NAc, an effect that reverted completely to control levels within 8-12 hr. In contrast, AP-1 binding activity in the NAc of animals treated chronically with cocaine remained elevated at acute levels 18 hr after the last chronic injection, a time at which c-fos and c-jun mRNA levels and Fos-like immunoreactivity had returned to control values. An additional acute cocaine challenge did not further increase AP-1 binding. The  data suggest that chronic cocaine treatment leads to a persistent increase in AP-1 binding activity, which may be involved in some of the physiological and behavioral aspects of cocaine addiction.", "27141430": "Dopamine (DA) transmission is governed by processes that regulate release from axonal boutons in the forebrain and the somatodendritic compartment in midbrain,  and by clearance by the DA transporter, diffusion, and extracellular metabolism.  We review how axonal DA release is regulated by neuronal activity and by autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, and address how quantal release events are regulated in size and frequency. In brain regions densely innervated by DA axons, DA clearance is due predominantly to uptake by the DA transporter, whereas in cortex, midbrain, and other regions with relatively sparse DA inputs, the norepinephrine transporter and diffusion are involved. We discuss the role of DA  uptake in restricting the sphere of influence of DA and in temporal accumulation  of extracellular DA levels upon successive action potentials. The tonic discharge activity of DA neurons may be translated into a tonic extracellular DA level, whereas their bursting activity can generate discrete extracellular DA transients.", "26335648": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the dynorphinergic system are widely implicated in motivated behaviors. Prior studies have shown that activation of the dynorphin-kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system leads to aversive, dysphoria-like behavior. However, the endogenous sources of dynorphin in these circuits remain unknown. We investigated whether dynorphinergic neuronal firing in the NAc is sufficient to induce aversive behaviors. We found that photostimulation of dynorphinergic cells in the ventral NAc shell elicits robust conditioned and real-time aversive behavior via KOR activation, and in contrast, photostimulation of dorsal NAc shell dynorphin cells induced a KOR-mediated place preference and was positively reinforcing. These results show previously unknown discrete subregions of dynorphin-containing cells in the NAc shell that selectively drive  opposing behaviors. Understanding the discrete regional specificity by which NAc  dynorphinerigic cells regulate preference and aversion provides insight into motivated behaviors that are dysregulated in stress, reward, and psychiatric disease.", "25878269": "The dopaminergic projections from the ventral midbrain to the striatum have long  been implicated in mediating motivated behaviors and addiction. Previously it was demonstrated that \u03ba-opioid receptor (KOR) signaling in the striatum plays a critical role in the increased reinforcing efficacy of ethanol following ethanol  vapor exposure in rodent models. Although rodents have been used extensively to determine the neurochemical consequences of chronic ethanol exposure, establishing high levels of voluntary drinking in these models has proven difficult. Conversely, nonhuman primates exhibit similar intake and pattern to humans in regard to drinking. Here we examine the effects of chronic voluntary ethanol self-administration on dopamine neurotransmission and the ability of KORs to regulate dopamine release in the dorsolateral caudate (DLC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) core. Using voltammetry in brain slices from cynomolgus macaques  after 6 months of ad libitum ethanol drinking, we found increased KOR sensitivity in both the DLC and NAc. The magnitude of ethanol intake predicted increases in KOR sensitivity in the NAc core, but not the DLC. Additionally, ethanol drinking  increased dopamine release and uptake in the NAc, but decreased both of these measures in the DLC. These data suggest that chronic daily drinking may result in regionally distinct disruptions of striatal outputs. In concert with previous reports showing increased KOR regulation of drinking behaviors induced by ethanol exposure, the strong relationship between KOR activity and voluntary ethanol intake observed here gives further support to the hypothesis that KORs may provide a promising pharmacotherapeutic target in the treatment of alcoholism.", "25765483": "BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that chronic ethanol exposure decreases  dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), contributing to a hypodopaminergic state during withdrawal. However, few studies have investigated  adaptations in presynaptic DA terminals after chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE)  exposure. In monkeys and rats, chronic ethanol exposure paradigms have been shown to increase DA uptake and D2 autoreceptor sensitivity. METHODS: The current study examined the effects of ethanol on DA terminals in CIE exposed mice during two time-points after the cessation of CIE exposure. DA release and uptake were measured using fast scan cyclic voltammetry in NAc core slices from C57BL/6J mice, 0h and 72h following three weekly cycles (4 days of 16h ethanol vapor/8h room air/day+3 days withdrawal) of CIE vapor exposure. RESULTS: Current results showed that DA release was reduced, uptake rates were increased, and inhibitory D2-type autoreceptor activity was augmented following CIE exposure in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these CIE-induced adaptations in the accumbal DA system reduce DA signaling and therefore reveal several potential mechanisms contributing to a functional hypodopaminergic state during alcohol withdrawal.", "25762676": "Given that the \u03ba opioid receptor (KOR) system has been implicated in psychostimulant abuse, we evaluated whether the selective KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine dihydrochloride (nor-BNI) would attenuate the escalation of methamphetamine (METH) intake in an extended-access self-administration model. Systemic nor-BNI decreased the escalation of intake of long-access (LgA) but not  short-access (ShA) self-administration. nor-BNI also decreased elevated progressive-ratio (PR) breakpoints in rats in the LgA condition and continued to  decrease intake after 17 d of abstinence, demonstrating that the effects of a nor-BNI injection are long lasting. Rats with an ShA history showed an increase in prodynorphin immunoreactivity in both the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell, but LgA animals showed a selective increase in the NAc shell. Other cohorts of rats received nor-BNI directly into the NAc shell or core and entered  into ShA or LgA. nor-BNI infusion in the NAc shell, but not NAc core, attenuated  escalation of intake and PR responding for METH in LgA rats. These data indicate  that the development and/or expression of compulsive-like responding for METH under LgA conditions depends on activation of the KOR system in the NAc shell and suggest that the dynorphin-KOR system is a central component of the neuroplasticity associated with negative reinforcement systems that drive the dark side of addiction.", "25664911": "Mesoaccumbens fibers are thought to co-release dopamine and glutamate. However, the mechanism is unclear, and co-release by mesoaccumbens fibers has not been documented. Using electron microcopy, we found that some mesoaccumbens fibers have vesicular transporters for dopamine (VMAT2) in axon segments that are continuous with axon terminals that lack VMAT2, but contain vesicular glutamate transporters type 2 (VGluT2). In vivo overexpression of VMAT2 did not change the  segregation of the two vesicular types, suggesting the existence of highly regulated mechanisms for maintaining this segregation. The mesoaccumbens axon terminals containing VGluT2 vesicles make asymmetric synapses, commonly associated with excitatory signaling. Using optogenetics, we found that dopamine  and glutamate were released from the same mesoaccumbens fibers. These findings reveal a complex type of signaling by mesoaccumbens fibers in which dopamine and  glutamate can be released from the same axons, but are not normally released at the same site or from the same synaptic vesicles.", "25657248": "Circuit remodeling driven by pathological forms of synaptic plasticity underlies  several psychiatric diseases, including addiction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been applied to treat a number of neurological and psychiatric conditions, although its effects are transient and mediated by largely unknown mechanisms. Recently, optogenetic protocols that restore normal transmission at identified synapses in mice have provided proof of the idea that cocaine-adaptive behavior can be reversed in vivo. The most efficient protocol relies on the activation of  metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluRs, which depotentiates excitatory synaptic inputs onto dopamine D1 receptor medium-sized spiny neurons and normalizes drug-adaptive behavior. We discovered that acute low-frequency DBS, refined by selective blockade of dopamine D1 receptors, mimics optogenetic mGluR-dependent normalization of synaptic transmission. Consequently, there was a long-lasting abolishment of behavioral sensitization.", "25611513": "Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons have been implicated in reward, aversion, salience, cognition, and several neuropsychiatric disorders. Optogenetic approaches involving transgenic Cre-driver mouse lines provide powerful tools for dissecting DA-specific functions. However, the emerging complexity of VTA circuits requires Cre-driver mouse lines that restrict transgene expression to a precisely defined cell population. Because of recent work reporting that VTA DA neurons projecting to the lateral habenula release GABA, but not DA, we performed an extensive anatomical, molecular, and functional characterization of prominent DA transgenic mouse driver lines. We find that transgenes under control of the tyrosine hydroxylase, but not the dopamine transporter, promoter exhibit dramatic non-DA cell-specific expression patterns within and around VTA nuclei. Our results demonstrate how Cre expression in unintentionally targeted cells in transgenic mouse lines can confound the interpretation of supposedly cell-type-specific experiments.

However, the VGCCs that  operate on mesostriatal axons are incompletely defined; previous studies encompassed channels on striatal cholinergic interneurons that strongly influence dopamine transmission. We define that multiple types of axonal VGCCs operate that extend beyond classic presynaptic N/P/Q channels to include T- and L-types. We reveal differences in VGCC function between mouse axon types that in humans are vulnerable versus resistant to Parkinson's disease. We show for the first time that this is underpinned by different sensitivity of dopamine transmission to extracellular Ca(2+) and by different spatiotemporal intracellular Ca(2+) microdomains. These data define key principles of how Ca(2+) and VGCCs govern dopamine transmission in the healthy brain and reveal differences between neuron  types that might contribute to vulnerability in disease. ABSTRACT: The axonal voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels (VGCCs) that catalyse dopamine (DA) transmission are incompletely defined. Yet, they are critical to DA function and might prime subpopulations of DA neurons for parkinsonian degeneration. Previous studies of VGCCs will have encompassed those on striatal cholinergic interneurons, which strongly influence DA transmission. We identify which VGCCs on DA axons govern DA transmission, we determine their dynamic properties and reveal an underlying basis for differences between the caudate putamen (CPu) and  nucleus accumbens (NAc). We detected DA release evoked electrically during nicotinic receptor blockade or optogenetically by light activation of channel rhodopsin-expressing DA axons in mouse striatal slices. Subtype-specific VGCC blockers indicated that N-, Q-, T- and L-VGCCs govern DA release in CPu, but in NAc, T and L-channels are relatively silent. The roles of the most dominant channels were inversely frequency-dependent, due to low-pass filtering of DA release by Ca(2+)-dependent relationships between initial release probability and short-term plasticity. Ca(2+) concentration-response curves revealed that differences between CPu and NAc were due to greater underlying Ca(2+) sensitivity of DA transmission from CPu axons. Functions for 'silent' L- and T-channels in NAc could be unmasked by elevating extracellular [Ca(2+)]. Furthermore, we identified a greater coupling between BAPTA-sensitive, fast Ca(2+) transients and DA transmission in CPu axons, and evidence for endogenous fast buffering of Ca(2+) in NAc. These data reveal that a range of VGCCs operate dynamically on DA  axons, depending on local driving forces. Furthermore, they reveal dramatic differences in Ca(2+) handling between axonal subpopulations that show different  vulnerability to parkinsonian degeneration.", "25229321": "Modulation of the concentration of dopamine (DA) released from dopaminergic terminals in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) influences behaviours such as the motivation to obtain drugs of abuse. \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB ) receptors are expressed throughout the mesolimbic circuit, including in the NAc,  and baclofen, an agonist of GABAB receptors, can decrease drug-seeking behaviours. However, the mechanism by which GABAB receptors modulate terminal DA  release has not been well studied. We explored how baclofen modulates the concentration of DA released from terminals in the NAc core using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in brain slices from adult male C57BL/6J mice. We found that baclofen concentration-dependently decreased single pulse-evoked DA release. This effect was blocked by the GABAB antagonist, CGP 52432, but not by a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Suppression of DA release by a saturating concentration of baclofen was sustained for up to 1 h. The effect of baclofen was reduced with electrical stimulations mimicking burst firing of DA neurons. Similar to the D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole, baclofen reduced the probability  of DA release, supporting a mechanistic overlap with D2 receptors. Baclofen-mediated suppression of DA release persisted after a locomotor-sensitizing cocaine treatment, indicating that GABAB receptors on DA terminals were not altered by cocaine exposure. These data suggest that baclofen-mediated suppression of terminal DA release is due to GABAB activation on DA terminals to reduce the probability of DA release. This effect does not readily desensitize, and persists regardless of chronic cocaine treatment.", "25003712": "Synaptic alterations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are crucial for the aberrant  reward-associated learning that forms the foundation of drug dependence. Altered  glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, in particular, is thought to be a vital component of the neurobiological underpinnings of addictive behavior. The development of bacterial artificial chromosome-eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) transgenic mice that express eGFP driven by endogenous D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) promoters has now allowed investigation of the cell type-specific  synaptic modifications in the NAc in response to drugs of abuse. In this study, we used whole-cell ex vivo slice electrophysiology in Drd1-eGFP mice to investigate cell type-specific alterations in NAc synaptic plasticity following ethanol exposure. Electrophysiological recordings were made from eGFP-expressing  medium spiny neurons (D1+ MSNs) and non-eGFP-expressing (putative D2 receptor-expressing) (D1- MSNs) from the shell subregion of the NAc. We observed  low frequency-induced long-term depression (1Hz-LTD) of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-mediated excitatory  postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) solely in D1+ MSNs. However, 24h following four consecutive days of in vivo chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure, 1-Hz LTD was conversely observed only in D1- MSNs, and now absent in D1+ MSNs. Complete recovery of the baseline plasticity phenotype in both cell types required a full 2 weeks of withdrawal from CIE vapor exposure. Thus, we observed  a cell type specificity of synaptic plasticity in the NAc shell, as well as, a gradual recovery of the pre-ethanol exposure plasticity state following extended  withdrawal. These changes highlight the adaptability of NAc shell MSNs to the effects of ethanol exposure and may represent critical neuroadaptations underlying the development of ethanol dependence.", "24715505": "The role of dopaminergic (DA) projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in appetitive and rewarding behavior has been widely studied, but the VTA also has documented DA-independent functions. Several drugs of abuse, act on VTA GABAergic neurons, and most studies have focused on local inhibitory connections. Relatively little is known about VTA GABA projection neurons and their connections to brain sites outside the VTA. This study employed viral-vector-mediated cell-type-specific anterograde tracing, classical retrograde tracing, and immunohistochemistry to characterize VTA GABA efferents throughout the brain. We found that VTA GABA neurons project widely to forebrain  and brainstem targets, including the ventral pallidum, lateral and magnocellular  preoptic nuclei, lateral hypothalamus, and lateral habenula. Minor projections also go to central amygdala, mediodorsal thalamus, dorsal raphe, and deep mesencephalic nuclei, and sparse projections go to prefrontal cortical regions and to nucleus accumbens shell and core. These projections differ from the major  VTA DA target regions. Retrograde tracing studies confirmed results from the anterograde experiments and differences in projections from VTA subnuclei. Retrogradely labeled GABA neurons were not numerous, and most non-tyrosine hydroxylase/retrogradely labeled cells lacked GABAergic markers. Many non-TH/retrogradely labeled cells projecting to several areas expressed VGluT2. VTA GABA and glutamate neurons project throughout the brain, most prominently to  regions with reciprocal connections to the VTA. These data indicate that VTA GABA and glutamate neurons may have more DA-independent functions than previously recognized.", "24647944": "A specialized cubic-millimeter hotspot in the rostrodorsal quadrant of medial shell in nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats may mediate opioid enhancement of gustatory hedonic impact or \"liking\". Here, we selectively stimulated the three major subtypes of opioid receptors via agonist microinjections [mu (DAMGO), delta (DPDPE), or kappa (U50488H)] and constructed anatomical maps for functional localizations of consequent changes in hedonic \"liking\" (assessed by affective orofacial reactions to sucrose taste) versus \"wanting\" (assessed by changes in food intake). Results indicated that the NAc rostrodorsal quadrant contains a shared opioid hedonic hotspot that similarly mediates enhancements of sucrose \"liking\" for mu, delta, and kappa stimulations. Within the rostrodorsal hotspot boundaries each type of stimulation generated at least a doubling or higher enhancement of hedonic reactions, with comparable intensities for all three types of opioid stimulation. By contrast, a negative hedonic coldspot was mapped in the caudal half of medial shell, where all three types of opioid stimulation suppressed \"liking\" reactions to approximately one-half normal levels. Different  anatomical patterns were produced for stimulation of food \"wanting\", reflected in food intake. Altogether, these results indicate that the rostrodorsal hotspot in  medial shell is unique for generating opioid-induced hedonic enhancement, and add delta and kappa signals to mu as hedonic generators within the hotspot. Also, the identification of a separable NAc caudal coldspot for hedonic suppression, and separate NAc opioid mechanisms for controlling food \"liking\" versus \"wanting\" further highlights NAc anatomical heterogeneity and localizations of function within subregions of medial shell.", "24463000": "Dopamine D2-autoreceptors play a key role in regulating the activity of dopamine  neurons and control the synthesis, release and uptake of dopamine. These Gi/o-coupled inhibitory receptors play a major part in shaping dopamine transmission. Found at both somatodendritic and axonal sites, autoreceptors regulate the firing patterns of dopamine neurons and control the timing and amount of dopamine released from their terminals in target regions. Alterations in the expression and activity of autoreceptors are thought to contribute to Parkinson's disease as well as schizophrenia, drug addiction and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which emphasizes the importance  of D2-autoreceptors in regulating the dopamine system. This review will summarize the cellular actions of dopamine autoreceptors and discuss recent advances that have furthered our understanding of the mechanisms by which D2-receptors control  dopamine transmission.", "23486954": "Although alcoholism is a worldwide problem resulting in millions of deaths, only  a small percentage of alcohol users become addicted. The specific neural substrates responsible for individual differences in vulnerability to alcohol addiction are not known. In this study, we used rodent models to study behavioral and synaptic correlates related to individual differences in the development of ethanol locomotor sensitization, a form of drug-dependent behavioral plasticity associated with addiction vulnerability. Male Swiss Webster mice were treated daily with saline or 1.8 g/kg ethanol for 21 d. Locomotor activity tests were performed once a week for 15 min immediately after saline or ethanol injections.  After at least 11 d of withdrawal, cohorts of saline- or ethanol-treated mice were used to characterize the relationships between locomotor sensitization, ethanol drinking, and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens. Ethanol-treated mice that expressed locomotor sensitization to ethanol drank significantly more ethanol than saline-treated subjects and ethanol-treated animals resilient to this form of behavioral plasticity. Moreover, ethanol-sensitized mice also had reduced accumbal NMDA receptor function and expression, as well as deficits in NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression in the nucleus accumbens core after a protracted withdrawal. These findings suggest that disruption of accumbal core NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity may represent a synaptic correlate associated with ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization and increased propensity to consume ethanol.", "23178810": "The ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) are essential for learning about environmental stimuli associated with motivationally relevant outcomes. The task of signalling such events, both rewarding and aversive, from the VTA to the NAc has largely been ascribed to dopamine neurons. The VTA also contains GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid)-releasing neurons, which provide local inhibition and also project to the NAc. However, the cellular targets and functional importance of this long-range inhibitory projection have not been ascertained. Here we show that GABA-releasing neurons of the VTA that project to  the NAc (VTA GABA projection neurons) inhibit accumbal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) to enhance stimulus-outcome learning. Combining optogenetics with structural imaging and electrophysiology, we found that VTA GABA projection neurons selectively target NAc CINs, forming multiple symmetrical synaptic contacts that generated inhibitory postsynaptic currents. This is remarkable considering that CINs represent a very small population of all accumbal neurons,  and provide the primary source of cholinergic tone in the NAc. Brief activation of this projection was sufficient to halt the spontaneous activity of NAc CINs, resembling the pause recorded in animals learning stimulus-outcome associations.  Indeed, we found that forcing CINs to pause in behaving mice enhanced discrimination of a motivationally important stimulus that had been associated with an aversive outcome. Our results demonstrate that VTA GABA projection neurons, through their selective targeting of accumbal CINs, provide a novel route through which the VTA communicates saliency to the NAc. VTA GABA projection neurons thus emerge as orchestrators of dopaminergic and cholinergic modulation in the NAc.", "23177963": "Excitatory afferents to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are thought to facilitate reward seeking by encoding reward-associated cues. Selective activation of different glutamatergic inputs to the NAc can produce divergent physiological and behavioral responses, but mechanistic explanations for these pathway-specific effects are lacking. Here, we compared the innervation patterns and synaptic properties of ventral hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, and prefrontal cortex input to the NAc. Ventral hippocampal input was found to be uniquely localized to the medial NAc shell, where it was predominant and selectively potentiated after  cocaine exposure. In\u00a0vivo, bidirectional optogenetic manipulations of this pathway attenuated and enhanced cocaine-induced locomotion. Challenging the idea  that any of these inputs encode motivationally neutral information, activation of each discrete pathway reinforced instrumental behaviors. Finally, direct optical  activation of medium spiny neurons proved to be capable of supporting self-stimulation, demonstrating that behavioral reinforcement is an explicit consequence of strong excitatory drive to the NAc.", "23040805": "Among the many neuromodulators used by the mammalian brain to regulate circuit function and plasticity, dopamine (DA) stands out as one of the most behaviorally powerful. Perturbations of DA signaling are implicated in the pathogenesis or exploited in the treatment of many neuropsychiatric diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), addiction, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and Tourette's syndrome. Although the precise mechanisms employed by DA to exert its control over behavior are not fully understood, DA is known to regulate many electrical and biochemical aspects of neuronal function including excitability, synaptic transmission, integration and plasticity, protein trafficking, and gene transcription. In this Review, we discuss the actions of DA on ionic and synaptic signaling in neurons of the prefrontal cortex and striatum, brain areas in which dopaminergic dysfunction is thought to be central to disease.", "23034651": "The substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area contain the two largest populations of dopamine-releasing neurons in the mammalian brain. These neurons extend elaborate projections in the striatum, a large subcortical structure implicated in motor planning and reward-based learning. Phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons in response to salient or reward-predicting stimuli is thought to modulate striatal output through the release of dopamine to promote and reinforce motor action. Here we show that activation of dopamine neurons in striatal slices rapidly inhibits action potential firing in both direct- and indirect-pathway striatal projection neurons through vesicular release of the inhibitory transmitter GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid). GABA is released directly from dopaminergic axons but in a manner that is independent of  the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT. Instead, GABA release requires activity of the vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT2, which is the vesicular transporter for dopamine. Furthermore, VMAT2 expression in GABAergic neurons lacking VGAT is sufficient to sustain GABA release. Thus, these findings expand the repertoire of synaptic mechanisms used by dopamine neurons to influence basal ganglia circuits, show a new substrate whose transport is dependent on VMAT2 and demonstrate that GABA can function as a bona fide co-transmitter in monoaminergic neurons.", "22840394": "Dopamine plays a critical role in motor control, addiction, and reward-seeking behaviors, and its release dynamics have traditionally been linked to changes in  midbrain dopamine neuron activity. Here, we report that selective endogenous cholinergic activation achieved via in vitro optogenetic stimulation of nucleus accumbens, a terminal field of dopaminergic neurons, elicits real-time dopamine release. This mechanism occurs via direct actions on dopamine terminals, does not require changes in neuron firing within the midbrain, and is dependent on glutamatergic receptor activity. More importantly, we demonstrate that in vivo selective activation of cholinergic interneurons is sufficient to elicit dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Therefore, the control of accumbal extracellular dopamine levels by endogenous cholinergic activity results from a complex convergence of neurotransmitter/neuromodulator systems that may ultimately synergize to drive motivated behavior.", "22794260": "Striatal dopamine plays key roles in our normal and pathological goal-directed actions. To understand dopamine function, much attention has focused on how midbrain dopamine neurons modulate their firing patterns. However, we identify a  presynaptic mechanism that triggers dopamine release directly, bypassing activity in dopamine neurons. We paired electrophysiological recordings of striatal channelrhodopsin2-expressing cholinergic interneurons with simultaneous detection of dopamine release at carbon-fiber microelectrodes in striatal slices. We reveal that activation of cholinergic interneurons by light flashes that cause only single action potentials in neurons from a small population triggers dopamine release via activation of nicotinic receptors on dopamine axons. This event overrides ascending activity from dopamine neurons and, furthermore, is reproduced by activating ChR2-expressing thalamostriatal inputs, which synchronize cholinergic interneurons in vivo. These findings indicate that synchronized activity in cholinergic interneurons directly generates striatal dopamine signals whose functions will extend beyond those encoded by dopamine neuron activity.", "22158102": "Drug-evoked synaptic plasticity is observed at many synapses and may underlie behavioural adaptations in addiction. Mechanistic investigations start with the identification of the molecular drug targets. Cocaine, for example, exerts its reinforcing and early neuroadaptive effects by inhibiting the dopamine transporter, thus causing a strong increase in mesolimbic dopamine. Among the many signalling pathways subsequently engaged, phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the nucleus accumbens is of particular interest because it has been implicated in NMDA-receptor and type 1 dopamine (D1)-receptor-dependent synaptic potentiation as well as in several behavioural adaptations. A causal link between drug-evoked plasticity at identified synapses and behavioural adaptations, however, is missing, and the benefits of restoring baseline transmission have yet to be demonstrated. Here we  find that cocaine potentiates excitatory transmission in D1-receptor-expressing medium-sized spiny neurons (D1R-MSNs) in mice via ERK signalling with a time course that parallels locomotor sensitization. Depotentiation of cortical nucleus accumbens inputs by optogenetic stimulation in vivo efficiently restored normal transmission and abolished cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. These findings establish synaptic potentiation selectively in D1R-MSNs as a mechanism underlying a core component of addiction, probably by creating an imbalance between distinct populations of MSNs in the nucleus accumbens. Our data also provide proof of principle that reversal of cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity can treat behavioural alterations caused by addictive drugs and may inspire novel therapeutic approaches involving deep brain stimulation or transcranial magnetic  stimulation.", "21469956": "The basal ganglia are a chain of subcortical nuclei that facilitate action selection. Two striatal projection systems--so-called direct and indirect pathways--form the functional backbone of the basal ganglia circuit. Twenty years ago, investigators proposed that the striatum's ability to use dopamine (DA) rise and fall to control action selection was due to the segregation of D(1) and D(2)  DA receptors in direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons. Although this hypothesis sparked a debate, the evidence that has accumulated since then clearly supports this model. Recent advances in the means of marking neural circuits with optical or molecular reporters have revealed a clear-cut dichotomy  between these two cell types at the molecular, anatomical, and physiological levels. The contrast provided by these studies has provided new insights into how the striatum responds to fluctuations in DA signaling and how diseases that alter this signaling change striatal function.", "21392532": "The fast sampling rates of fast scan cyclic voltammetry make it a favorable method for measuring changes in brain monoamine release and uptake kinetics in slice, anesthetized, and freely moving preparations. The most common analysis technique for evaluating changes in dopamine signaling uses well-established Michaelis-Menten kinetic methods that can accurately model dopamine release and uptake parameters across multiple experimental conditions. Nevertheless, over the years, many researchers have turned to other measures to estimate changes in dopamine release and uptake, yet to our knowledge no systematic comparison amongst these measures has been conducted. To address this lack of uniformity in  kinetic analyses, we have created the Demon Voltammetry and Analysis software suite, which is freely available to academic and non-profit institutions. Here we present an explanation of the Demon Voltammetry acquisition and analysis features, and demonstrate its utility for acquiring voltammetric data under in vitro, in vivo anesthetized, and freely moving conditions. Additionally, the software was used to compare the sensitivity of multiple kinetic measures of release and uptake to cocaine-induced changes in electrically evoked dopamine efflux in nucleus accumbens core slices. Specifically, we examined and compared tau, full width at half height, half-life, T\u2082\u2080, T\u2088\u2080, slope, peak height, calibrated peak dopamine concentration, and area under the curve to the well-characterized Michaelis-Menten parameters, dopamine per pulse, maximal uptake rate, and apparent affinity. Based on observed results we recommend tau for measuring dopamine uptake and calibrated peak dopamine concentration for measuring dopamine release.", "21228905": "The canonical view of striatal GABAergic interneurons has evolved over several decades of neuroanatomical/neurochemical and electrophysiological studies. From the anatomical studies, three distinct GABAergic interneuronal subtypes are generally recognized. The best-studied subtype expresses the calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin. The second best known interneuron type expresses a number of neuropeptides and enzymes, including neuropeptide Y, somatostatin, and nitric  oxide synthase. The last GABAergic interneuron subtype expresses the calcium binding protein, calretinin. There is no overlap or co-localization of these three different sets of markers. The parvalbumin-immunoreactive GABAergic interneurons have been recorded in vitro and shown to exhibit a fast-spiking phenotype characterized by short duration action potentials with large and rapid  spike AHPs. They often fire in a stuttering pattern of high frequency firing interrupted by periods of silence. They are capable of sustained firing rates of  over 200\u2009Hz. The NPY/SOM/NOS interneurons have been identified as PLTS cells, exhibiting very high input resistances, low threshold spike and prolonged plateau potentials in response to intracellular depolarization or excitatory synaptic stimulation. Thus far, no recordings from identified CR interneurons have been obtained. Recent advances in technological approaches, most notably the generation of several BAC transgenic mouse strains which express a fluorescent marker, enhanced green fluorescent protein, specifically and selectively only in  neurons of a certain genetic makeup (e.g., parvalbumin-, neuropeptide Y-, or tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons etc.) have led to the ability of electrophysiologists to visualize and patch specific neuron types in brain slices with epifluorescence illumination. This has led to a rapid expansion of the number of neurochemically and/or electrophysiologically identified interneuronal  cell types in the striatum and elsewhere. This article will review the anatomy, neurochemistry, electrophysiology, synaptic connections, and function of the three \"classic\" striatal GABAergic interneurons as well as more recent data derived from in vitro recordings from BAC transgenic mice as well as recent in vivo data.", "20554874": "Coincident signaling by dopamine and glutamate is thought to be crucial for a variety of motivated behaviors. Previous work has suggested that some midbrain dopamine neurons are themselves capable of glutamate corelease, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. Here, we expressed the light-activated cation channel Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in genetically defined midbrain dopamine neurons to stimulate exocytosis specifically from dopaminergic terminals in both  the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and dorsal striatum of brain slices from adult  mice. Optical activation resulted in robust glutamate-mediated EPSCs in all medium spiny neurons examined in the NAc shell. In contrast, optically evoked glutamatergic currents were nearly undetectable in the dorsal striatum. Further,  we used a conditional knock-out mouse lacking vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) specifically in dopamine neurons to determine whether VGLUT2 is required for the exocytotic release of glutamate from dopamine neurons. Our data show that conditional knock-out completely abolished all optically evoked glutamate release. These results provide definitive physiological evidence for VGLUT2-mediated glutamate release by mature dopamine neurons projecting to the NAc shell, but not to the dorsal striatum. Thus, the unique ability of NAc-projecting dopamine neurons to synchronously activate both dopamine and glutamate receptors may have crucial implications for the ability to respond to motivationally significant stimuli.", "20372879": "RATIONALE: Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) have been implicated in depressive-like  states associated with chronic administration of drugs of abuse and stress. Although KOR agonists decrease dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), KOR modulation of phasic dopamine release in the core and shell subregions of the NAc-which have distinct roles in reward processing-remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: Studies were designed to examine whether the time course of effects of KOR activation on phasic dopamine release in the NAc core or shell are similar to effects on motivated behavior. METHODS: The effect of systemic administration of the KOR agonist salvinorin A (salvA)-at a dose (2.0 mg/kg) previously determined to have depressive-like effects-was measured on electrically evoked phasic dopamine release in the NAc core or shell of awake and behaving rats using fast scan cyclic voltammetry. In parallel, the effects of salvA on intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) and sucrose-reinforced responding were assessed. For comparison, a threshold dose of  salvA (0.25 mg/kg) was also tested. RESULTS: The active, but not threshold, dose of salvA significantly decreased phasic dopamine release without affecting dopamine reuptake in the NAc core and shell. SalvA increased ICSS thresholds and significantly lowered breakpoint on the progressive ratio schedule, indicating a decrease in motivation. The time course of the KOR-mediated decrease in dopamine in the core was qualitatively similar to the effects on motivated behavior. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the effects of KOR activation on motivation  are due, in part, to inhibition of phasic dopamine signaling in the NAc core.", "19912327": "Drug seeking is significantly regulated by drug-associated cues and associative learning between environmental cues and cocaine reward is mediated by dopamine transmission within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, dopamine transmission during early acquisition of a cue-cocaine association has never been assessed because of the technical difficulties associated with resolving cue-evoked and cocaine-evoked dopamine release within the same conditioning trial. Here, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure sub-second fluctuations in dopamine concentration within the NAc core and shell during the initial acquisition of a cue-cocaine Pavlovian association. Within the NAc core, cue-evoked dopamine release developed during conditioning. However, within the NAc shell, the predictive cue appeared to cause an unconditioned decrease in dopamine concentration. The pharmacological effects of cocaine also differed between sub-regions, as cocaine increased phasic dopamine release events within the NAc shell but not the core. Thus, real-time measurements not only revealed the initial development of a conditioned neurochemical response but also demonstrated differential phasic dopamine transmission patterns across NAc sub-regions during  the acquisition of a cue-cocaine association.", "19460877": "Dopamine (DA) release varies within subregions and local environments of the striatum, suggesting that controls intrinsic and extrinsic to the DA fibers and terminals regulate release. While applying fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and using tonic and phasic stimulus trains, we investigated the regulation of DA release in the dorsolateral to ventral striatum. The ratio of phasic-to-tonic-evoked DA signals varied with the average ongoing firing frequency, and the ratio was generally higher in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) compared with the dorsolateral striatum. At the normal average firing frequency, burst stimulation produces a larger increase in the DA response in the NAc than the dorsolateral striatum. This finding was comparable whether the DA measurements were made using in vitro  brain slices or were recorded in vivo from freely moving rodents. Blockade of the dopamine transporters and dopamine D(2) receptors particularly enhanced the tonic DA signals. Conversely, blockade of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) containing the beta(2) subunit (beta(2)(*)) predominantly suppressed tonic DA signals. The suppression of tonic DA release increased the contrast between phasic and tonic DA signals, and that made the frequency-dependent DA dynamics between the dorsolateral striatum and NAc more similar. The results indicate that intrinsic differences in the DA fibers that innervate specific regions of the striatum combine with (at least) DA transporters, DA receptors, and nAChRs to regulate the frequency dependence of DA release. A combination of mechanisms provides specific local control of DA release that underlies pathway-specific information associated with motor and reward-related functions.", "19389999": "Natural rewards and drugs of abuse can alter dopamine signaling, and ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons are known to fire action potentials tonically or phasically under different behavioral conditions. However, without technology to control specific neurons with appropriate temporal precision in freely behaving mammals, the causal role of these action potential patterns in driving behavioral changes has been unclear. We used optogenetic tools to selectively stimulate VTA dopaminergic neuron action potential firing in freely behaving mammals. We found that phasic activation of these neurons was sufficient to drive behavioral conditioning and elicited dopamine transients with magnitudes not achieved by longer, lower-frequency spiking. These results demonstrate that phasic dopaminergic activity is sufficient to mediate mammalian behavioral conditioning.", "19389195": "BACKGROUND: Dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens fluctuate on phasic  (subsecond) and tonic (over minutes) timescales in awake rats. Acute ethanol increases tonic concentrations of dopamine, but its effect on subsecond dopamine  transients has not been fully explored. METHODS: We measured tonic and phasic dopamine fluctuations in the nucleus accumbens of rats in response to ethanol (within-subject cumulative dosing, 0.125 to 2 g/kg, i.v.). RESULTS: Microdialysis samples yielded significant tonic increases in dopamine concentrations at 1 to 2 g/kg ethanol in each rat, while repeated saline infusions had no effect. When monitored with fast scan cyclic voltammetry, ethanol increased the frequency of dopamine transients in 6 of 16 recording sites, in contrast to the uniform effect of ethanol as measured with microdialysis. In the remaining 10 recording sites that were unresponsive to ethanol, dopamine transients either decreased in frequency or were unaffected by  cumulative ethanol infusions, patterns also observed during repeated saline infusions. The responsiveness of particular recording sites to ethanol was not correlated with either core versus shell placement of the electrodes or the basal rate of dopamine transients. Importantly, the phasic response pattern to a single dose of ethanol at a particular site was qualitatively reproduced when a second dose of ethanol was administered, suggesting that the variable between-site effects reflected specific pharmacology at that recording site. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the relatively uniform dopamine concentrations obtained with microdialysis can mask a dramatic heterogeneity of phasic dopamine release within the accumbens.", "18687967": "At synapses between cortical pyramidal neurons and principal striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), postsynaptic D1 and D2 dopamine (DA) receptors are postulated to be necessary for the induction of long-term potentiation and depression, respectively-forms of plasticity thought to underlie associative learning. Because these receptors are restricted to two distinct MSN populations, this postulate demands that synaptic plasticity be unidirectional in each cell type. Using brain slices from DA receptor transgenic mice, we show that this is not the case. Rather, DA plays complementary roles in these two types of MSN to ensure that synaptic plasticity is bidirectional and Hebbian. In models of Parkinson's disease, this system is thrown out of balance, leading to unidirectional changes in plasticity that could underlie network pathology and symptoms.", "18500330": "Relapse to cocaine use after prolonged abstinence is an important clinical problem. This relapse is often induced by exposure to cues associated with cocaine use. To account for the persistent propensity for relapse, it has been suggested that cue-induced cocaine craving increases over the first several weeks of abstinence and remains high for extended periods. We and others identified an  analogous phenomenon in rats that was termed 'incubation of cocaine craving': time-dependent increases in cue-induced cocaine-seeking over the first months after withdrawal from self-administered cocaine. Cocaine-seeking requires the activation of glutamate projections that excite receptors for alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) in the nucleus accumbens. Here we show that the number of synaptic AMPA receptors in the accumbens is increased after prolonged withdrawal from cocaine self-administration by the addition of new AMPA receptors lacking glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2). Furthermore, we show that these new receptors mediate the incubation of cocaine craving. Our results indicate that GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors could be a new target for drug development for the treatment of cocaine addiction. We propose that after prolonged withdrawal from cocaine, increased numbers of synaptic AMPA receptors combined with the higher conductance of GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors causes increased reactivity of accumbens neurons to  cocaine-related cues, leading to an intensification of drug craving and relapse.", "18003850": "The value of rewards (natural rewards and drugs) is associated with dopamine increases in the nucleus accumbens and varies as a function of context. The prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the context dependency of rewards and in the fixated high value that drugs have in addiction, although the mechanisms are  not properly understood. Here we test the hypothesis that the prefrontal cortex regulates the value of rewards by modulating dopamine increases in nucleus accumbens and that this regulation is disrupted in addicted subjects. We used positron emission tomography to evaluate the activity of the prefrontal cortex (measuring brain glucose metabolism with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose) and dopamine increases (measured with [11C]raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand with binding that is sensitive to endogenous dopamine) induced by the stimulant drug methylphenidate in 20 controls and 20 detoxified alcoholics, most of whom smoked. In all subjects, methylphenidate significantly increased dopamine in striatum. In ventral striatum (where the nucleus accumbens is located) and in putamen, dopamine increases were associated with the rewarding effects of methylphenidate  (drug liking and high) and were profoundly attenuated in alcoholics (70 and 50% lower than controls, respectively). In controls, but not in alcoholics, metabolism in orbitofrontal cortex (region involved with salience attribution) was negatively associated with methylphenidate-induced dopamine increases in ventral striatum. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the orbitofrontal cortex modulates the value of rewards by regulating the magnitude of dopamine increases in the ventral striatum and that disruption of this regulation may underlie the decreased sensitivity to rewards in addicted subjects.", "17868902": "Drug addiction is a chronic relapsing disease in which drug administration becomes the primary stimulus that drives behavior regardless of the adverse consequence that may ensue. As drug use becomes more compulsive, motivation for natural rewards that normally drive behavior decreases. The discontinuation of drug use is associated with somatic signs of withdrawal, dysphoria, anxiety, and  anhedonia. These consequences of drug use are thought to contribute to the maintenance of drug use and to the reinstatement of compulsive drug use that occurs during the early phase of abstinence. Even, however, after prolonged periods of abstinence, 80-90% of human addicts relapse to addiction, suggesting that repeated drug use produces enduring changes in brain circuits that subserve  incentive motivation and stimulus-response (habit) learning. A major goal of addiction research is the identification of the neural mechanisms by which drugs  of abuse produce these effects. This article will review data showing that the dynorphin/kappa-opioid receptor (KOPr) system serves an essential function in opposing alterations in behavior and brain neurochemistry that occur as a consequence of repeated drug use and that aberrant activity of this system may not only contribute to the dysregulation of behavior that characterizes addiction but to individual differences in vulnerability to the pharmacological actions of  cocaine and alcohol. We will provide evidence that the repeated administration of cocaine and alcohol up-regulates the dynorphin/KOPr system and that pharmacological treatments that target this system may prove effective in the treatment of drug addiction.", "17868375": "Many individual neurons within the intact brain fire in stochastic patterns that  arise from interactions with the neuronal circuits that they comprise. However, the chemical communication that is evoked by these firing patterns has not been characterized because sensors suitable to monitor subsecond chemical events in micron dimensions have only recently become available. Here we employ a voltammetric sensor technology coupled with principal component regression to examine the dynamics of dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of awake and unrestrained rats. The sensor has submillimeter dimensions and provides high temporal (0.1 s) resolution. At select locations spontaneous dopamine transient concentration changes were detected, achieving instantaneous concentrations of approximately 50 nm. At other locations, transients were absent even though dopamine was available for release as shown by extracellular dopamine increases following electrical activation of dopaminergic neurons. At sites where dopamine concentration transients occur, uptake inhibition by cocaine enhances the frequency and magnitude of the rapid transients while also causing a more gradual increase in extracellular dopamine. These effects were largely absent from sites that did not support ongoing transient activity. These findings reveal an unanticipated spatial and temporal heterogeneity of dopamine transmission within the NAc that may depend upon the firing of specific subpopulations of dopamine neurons.", "17492432": "RATIONALE: Existing data strongly suggest that alcohol affects dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the brain. However, many questions remain about the effects  of alcohol on the delicate equilibrium between such neurochemical processes as DA release and uptake. Dysregulation of these processes in the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal systems after chronic alcohol ingestion could be a neuroadaptation  contributing to dependence. OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we have employed an alcohol vapor inhalation model to characterize the effects of chronic alcohol exposure on DA dynamics in rat nucleus accumbens (NAc) and caudate putamen (CP) using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) in brain slices. This method provides a unique view of real-time, spatially resolved changes in DA concentration. RESULTS: We found that chronic alcohol exposure enhanced DA uptake rates in rat NAc and CP. These changes would have the effect of down-regulating extracellular  DA levels, presumably a compensatory effect related to increased DA release by repeated alcohol exposure. The sensitivity of terminal release-regulating DA autoreceptors was not different in alcohol-exposed rats compared with alcohol-na\u00efve animals. CONCLUSIONS: The DA uptake changes after chronic alcohol exposure documented here using FSCV may be associated with a compensatory response of the DA system aimed  at decreasing DA signaling. Alterations in autoreceptor function may require relatively long lasting alcohol exposure.", "17473837": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that activation of the dynorphin/kappa (kappa)-opioid system has a role in the increased consumption of  ethanol in dependent animals. The effects of three opioid receptor antagonists with different effects on opioid receptors, naltrexone, nalmefene, and nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI), were compared in their ability to decrease ethanol self-administration in nondependent and ethanol-dependent male Wistar rats. Nalmefene and naltrexone are both opioid receptor ligands with comparable molecular weights and pharmacokinetic profiles, but differing specificity for the three opioid receptor subtypes at low doses, while nor-BNI is a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. Dependence was induced in half the animals by subjecting them to a 4-week intermittent vapor exposure period in which animals were exposed to ethanol vapor for 14 h per day. Subsequent to dependence induction, nalmefene, naltrexone, and nor-BNI were tested for their ability to modulate self-administration of ethanol in vapor-exposed and control rats. The results indicated that both nalmefene and naltrexone induced a significant dose-dependent decrease in the number of lever presses for ethanol in both groups of animals. However, in ethanol-dependent animals, nalmefene was significantly more effective in suppressing ethanol intake than naltrexone. Nor-BNI selectively attenuated ethanol-dependent self-administration while leaving nondependent ethanol self-administration intact. Because naltrexone is primarily selective for the mu-opioid receptor, and nalmefene is primarily selective for the mu- and kappa-opioid receptor subtypes, the fact that nalmefene demonstrates more suppression in dependent animals suggests that opioid systems distinct from the mu-regulated portion may be involved in the increased drinking seen during withdrawal in dependent animals. The results with nor-BNI confirm that kappa-opioid receptor antagonism selectively decreases dependence-induced ethanol self-administration, which supports the hypothesis that dynorphin/kappa-opioid systems are dysregulated in dependence and contribute to the increased drinking seen during acute withdrawal in dependent rats.", "16776597": "Addiction is a state of compulsive drug use; despite treatment and other attempts to control drug taking, addiction tends to persist. Clinical and laboratory observations have converged on the hypothesis that addiction represents the pathological usurpation of neural processes that normally serve reward-related learning. The major substrates of persistent compulsive drug use are hypothesized to be molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie long-term associative memories in several forebrain circuits (involving the ventral and dorsal striatum and prefrontal cortex) that receive input from midbrain dopamine neurons. Here we review progress in identifying candidate mechanisms of addiction.", "15702135": "Despite large numbers of studies describing neuroadaptations caused by chronic cocaine exposure, there remains considerable uncertainty as to whether alterations in dopamine (DA) neurotransmission are responsible for progression into an addicted state. High-intake, 24-h access cocaine self-administration (SA, 10 days) followed by an extended (7 days), but not 1 day deprivation period produces an increased motivation to SA cocaine as measured by a progressive ratio protocol. Following binge cocaine SA and deprivation, the status of DA terminals  in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was investigated using microdialysis in freely moving rats and voltammetry in brain slices. At 1 and 7 days following binge cocaine SA, baseline extracellular DA concentrations in the NAc core were decreased by 40 and 55% of control levels, in the 1 and 7 day deprivation groups, respectively. Acute cocaine (1.5 mg/kg, i.v.) administration increased extracellular DA (350%) in the NAc core of na\u00efve animals but failed to significantly increase DA at 1 or 7 days following binge cocaine SA. The shell of the NAc showed a similar lack of effect of cocaine. Analysis of DA terminals in brain slices showed that cocaine was markedly less effective in inhibiting DA uptake at 1 and 7 days of cocaine deprivation (max effect 40% of control). Electrically stimulated DA release was decreased at 1 day and further decreased at 7 days of deprivation (67 and 49% of control, respectively). The rate of DA uptake was increased (150% of control) following binge SA, irrespective of deprivation period. Finally, presynaptic autoreceptors were subsensitive at both  time points, as measured by the ability of quinpirole, a D2-like DA receptor agonist, to inhibit DA release. Thus, the NAc was hypodopaminergic and DA terminals were less sensitive to cocaine following binge cocaine SA and deprivation.", "15608599": "BACKGROUND: The development of dependence may have significant motivational consequences regarding continued use and abuse of ethanol. We have developed a mouse model of ethanol dependence and repeated withdrawals that demonstrates sensitization of seizures and other symptoms of withdrawal. It is unclear whether such experience influences ethanol drinking behavior. The present series of experiments were designed to examine whether repeated cycles of chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal has an impact on subsequent motivation to voluntarily self-administer ethanol. METHODS: With the use of a modified sucrose-fading procedure, adult male C57BL/6J mice were trained to drink 15% (v/v) ethanol in a limited access procedure (2 hr/day). The animals were not food or water deprived at any time during the experiments. Once stable baseline intake was established, mice were exposed to four cycles of 16 hr of ethanol vapor (or air) in inhalation chambers separated by 8-hr periods of withdrawal. At 32 hr after the last cycle of ethanol exposure, all mice were tested for ethanol intake under limited access conditions for 5 consecutive days. The animals then received a second series of chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal followed by another 5-day test period for ethanol drinking. RESULTS: Stable daily baseline intake was established in mice that drank 15% ethanol combined with 5% sucrose (experiment 1), 15% ethanol alone (experiment 2), 5% sucrose alone (experiment 3), or 15% ethanol when presented as a choice with water (experiment 4). After repeated cycles of chronic ethanol exposure and  withdrawal experience, consumption of ethanol solutions increased over baseline levels and in comparison with control (air-exposed) groups. However, sucrose consumption did not change in mice that were trained to drink 5% sucrose. The increase in ethanol consumption after chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal experience resulted in a significant increase in resultant blood ethanol levels. CONCLUSIONS: Once the positive reinforcing properties of ethanol were established, chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal experience resulted in a significant increase in voluntary ethanol drinking that yielded a >2-fold increase in resultant blood ethanol levels. This increase in ethanol intake occurred whether ethanol was presented in combination with sucrose, alone (unadulterated), or as a choice with tap water. Furthermore, this effect seems to be selective for ethanol in that animals that were trained to drink a sucrose solution did not exhibit a change in their intake after similar chronic ethanol exposure. As such, this model may be useful in studying the mechanisms and conditions in which chronic ethanol treatment influences motivation to resume drinking after a period of abstinence (relapse).", "15464140": "Microdialysis studies in animals have shown that addictive drugs preferentially increase extracellular dopamine (DA) in the n. accumbens (NAc). Brain imaging studies, while extending these finding to humans, have shown a correlation between psychostimulant-induced increase of extracellular DA in the striatum and  self-reported measures of liking and 'high' (euphoria). Although a correlate of drug reward independent from associative learning and performance is difficult to obtain in animals, conditioned taste avoidance (CTA) might meet these requirements. Addictive drugs induce CTA to saccharin most likely as a result of  anticipatory contrast of saccharin over drug reward. Consistently with a role of  DA in drug reward, D2 or combined D1/D2 receptor blockade abolishes cocaine, amphetamine and nicotine CTA. Intracranial self-administration studies with mixtures of D1 and D2 receptor agonists point to the NAc shell as the critical site of DA reward. NAc shell DA acting on D1 receptors is also involved in Pavlovian learning through pre-trial and post-trial consolidation mechanisms and  in the utilization of spatial short-term memory for goal-directed behavior. Stimulation of NAc shell DA transmission by addictive drugs is shared by a natural reward like food but lacks its adaptive properties (habituation and inhibition by predictive stimuli). These peculiarities of drug-induced stimulation of DA transmission in the NAc shell result in striking differences in the impact of drug-conditioned stimuli on DA transmission. It is speculated that  drug addiction results from the impact exerted on behavior by the abnormal DA stimulant properties acquired by drug-conditioned stimuli as a result of their association with addictive drugs.", "15233923": "Midbrain dopamine and striatal tonically active neurons (TANs, presumed acetylcholine interneurons) signal behavioral significance of environmental events. Since striatal dopamine and acetylcholine affect plasticity of cortico-striatal transmission and are both crucial to learning, they may serve as teachers in the basal ganglia circuits. We recorded from both neuronal populations in monkeys performing a probabilistic instrumental conditioning task. Both neuronal types respond robustly to reward-related events. Although different events yielded responses with different latencies, the responses of the two populations coincided, indicating integration at the target level. Yet, while the dopamine neurons' response reflects mismatch between expectation and outcome in the positive domain, the TANs are invariant to reward predictability. Finally, TAN pairs are synchronized, compared to a minority of dopamine neuron pairs. We conclude that the striatal cholinergic and dopaminergic systems carry distinct messages by different means, which can be integrated differently to shape the basal ganglia responses to reward-related events.", "15019426": "The nucleus accumbens is a brain region that participates in the control of behaviors related to natural reinforcers, such as ingestion, sexual behavior, incentive and instrumental learning, and that also plays a role in addictive processes. This paper comprises a review of work from our laboratory that focuses on two main research areas: (i). the role of the nucleus accumbens in food motivation, and (ii). its putative functions in cellular plasticity underlying appetitive learning. First, work within a number of different behavioral paradigms has shown that accumbens neurochemical systems play specific and dissociable roles in different aspects of food seeking and food intake, and part  of this function depends on integration with the lateral hypothalamus and amygdala. We propose that the nucleus accumbens integrates information related to cognitive, sensory, and emotional processing with hypothalamic mechanisms mediating energy balance. This system as a whole enables complex hierarchical control of adaptive ingestive behavior. Regarding the second research area, our studies examining acquisition of lever-pressing for food in rats have shown that  activation of glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, within broadly distributed but interconnected regions (nucleus accumbens core, posterior striatum, prefrontal cortex, basolateral and central amygdala), is critical for such learning to occur. This receptor stimulation triggers intracellular cascades that involve protein phosphorylation and new protein synthesis. It is hypothesized that activity in this distributed network (including D1 receptor activity) computes coincident events and thus enhances the probability that temporally related actions and events (e.g. lever pressing and delivery of reward) become associated. Such basic mechanisms of plasticity within this reinforcement learning network also appear to be profoundly affected in addiction.", "14515345": "Author information:  (1)Center for the Neurobehavioral Studies an Alcohol, Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA.", "11716947": "Quantifying mechanisms underlying extracellular signaling by the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is a difficult task, particularly in the complex extracellular microenvironment of the intact brain. In this study, two methods for evaluating release and uptake from DA dynamics monitored by real-time voltammetry are described. Both are based on a neurochemical model characterizing electrically evoked levels of DA as a balance between these opposing mechanisms. The theoretical basis of what is called here nonlinear regression and single curve analyses is given. Fitting simulated data tests the reliability of the methods. The two analyses are also compared with an experimental data set describing the effects of pharmacologically inhibiting the DA transporter in the caudate-putamen (CP) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). The results indicate that nonlinear regression  and single curve analyses are suitable for quantifying release and uptake mechanisms underlying DA neurotransmission. Additionally, the most important experimental finding of this technical study was the independent confirmation of  high affinity (approximately 0.2 microM) DA uptake in the intact striatum.", "11713470": "Dopamine is vital for coordinated motion and for association learning linked to behavioral reinforcement. Here we show that the precise overlap of striatal dopaminergic and cholinergic fibers underlies potent control of dopamine release  by ongoing nicotinic receptor activity. In mouse striatal slices, nicotinic antagonists or depletion of endogenous acetylcholine decreased evoked dopamine release by 90%. Nicotine at the concentration experienced by smokers also regulated dopamine release. In mutant mice lacking the beta2 nicotinic subunit, evoked dopamine release was dramatically suppressed, and those mice did not show  cholinergic regulation of dopamine release. The results offer new perspectives when considering nicotine addiction and the high prevalence of smoking in schizophrenics.", "11574942": "To assess the direct effects of acute ethanol on dopamine (DA) terminals, evoked  DA release and uptake were measured in rat nucleus accumbens slices using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Low and moderate concentrations of ethanol (20, 45  and 100 mM) did not alter evoked DA release, while high concentrations (150 and 200 mM) significantly decreased DA release (18 and 36%, respectively) in a calcium-dependent manner. No significant difference was found between the rate of DA disappearance measured before and after the drug. These data indicate that uptake of DA through the dopamine transporter is unaffected by ethanol, even at high concentrations. Therefore, low to moderate concentrations of ethanol have no effect on DA dynamics at the level of the nerve terminal in the nucleus accumbens. This is consistent with the hypothesis that cell body regions of DA neurons are the primary target for the stimulating and reinforcing effects of ethanol. High concentrations of ethanol can locally depress DA release, and this  may correlate with the sedative actions of the drug.", "11544526": "Positive reinforcement helps to control the acquisition of learned behaviours. Here we report a cellular mechanism in the brain that may underlie the behavioural effects of positive reinforcement. We used intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) as a model of reinforcement learning, in which each rat learns to press a lever that applies reinforcing electrical stimulation to its own substantia nigra. The outputs from neurons of the substantia nigra terminate  on neurons in the striatum in close proximity to inputs from the cerebral cortex  on the same striatal neurons. We measured the effect of substantia nigra stimulation on these inputs from the cortex to striatal neurons and also on how quickly the rats learned to press the lever. We found that stimulation of the substantia nigra (with the optimal parameters for lever-pressing behaviour) induced potentiation of synapses between the cortex and the striatum, which required activation of dopamine receptors. The degree of potentiation within ten  minutes of the ICSS trains was correlated with the time taken by the rats to learn ICSS behaviour. We propose that stimulation of the substantia nigra when the lever is pressed induces a similar potentiation of cortical inputs to the striatum, positively reinforcing the learning of the behaviour by the rats.", "10415644": "The nucleus accumbens and its associated circuitry subserve behaviors linked to natural or biological rewards, such as feeding, drinking, sex, exploration, and appetitive learning. We have investigated the functional role of neurotransmitter and intracellular transduction mechanisms in behaviors subserved by the core and  shell subsystems within the accumbens. Local infusion of the selective NMDA antagonist, AP-5, into the accumbens core, but not the shell, completely blocked  acquisition of a bar-press response for food in hungry rats. This effect was apparent only when infused during the early stages of learning. We have also recently shown that infusion of certain protein kinase inhibitors into the core also impairs learning in the same paradigm. These results suggest that plasticity-related mechanisms within the accumbens core, involving glutamate-linked intracellular second messengers, are important for response-reinforcement learning. In contrast to the core, which primarily connects to somatic motor output systems, the shell is more intimately linked to  viscero-endocrine effector systems. We have shown that both AMPA and GABA receptors within the medial shell (but not the core) are critically involved in controlling the brain's feeding pathways, via activation of the lateral hypothalamus (LH). This effect is blocked by local inhibition of the LH in double-cannulae experiments and also strongly and selectively activates Fos expression in the LH.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the DA system in the brain of alcoholics. We evaluated 10 alcoholics and 17 nonalcoholics using positron emission tomography and [11C]raclopride to measure DA D2 receptors. In addition, in 5 of the alcoholics and 16 of the nonalcoholics, we also measured DA transporters with [11C]d-threo methylphenidate. The ratio of the distribution volumes in striatum to that in cerebellum, which corresponds to Bmax/Kd + 1, was  used as model parameter of DA D2 receptor and transporter availability. Dopamine  D2 receptor availability (Bmax/Kd) was significantly lower in alcoholics (2.1 +/- 0.5) than in nonalcoholics (2.7 +/- 0.6) (p < 0.05) and was not correlated with days since last alcohol use. Alcoholics showed DA transporter values similar to those in nonalcoholics. The ratio of DA D2 receptor to transporter availability was significantly higher in nonalcoholics (1.4 +/- 0.1) than in alcoholics (1.1 +/- 0.1) (p < 0.005). Alcoholics showed significant reductions in D2 receptors (postsynaptic marker) but not in DA transporter availability (presynaptic marker) when compared with nonalcoholics. Because D2 receptors in striatum are mainly localized in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) cells these results provide evidence  of GABAergic involvement in the dopaminergic abnormalities seen in alcoholics.", "8367449": "Activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system was investigated in rats withdrawn from chronic ethanol administration by single-cell extracellular recordings from  dopaminergic neurons of the ventrotegmental area, coupled with antidromic identification from the nucleus accumbens, and by microdialysis-technique experiments in the nucleus accumbens. Spontaneous firing rates, spikes per burst, and absolute burst firing but not the number of spontaneously active neurons were found drastically reduced; whereas absolute and relative refractory periods increased in rats withdrawn from chronic ethanol treatment as compared with chronic saline-treated controls. Consistently, dopamine outflow in the nucleus accumbens and its acid metabolites were reduced after abruptly stopping chronic ethanol administration. All these changes, as well as ethanol-withdrawal behavioral signs, were reversed by ethanol administration. This reversal suggests that the abrupt cessation of chronic ethanol administration plays a causal role in the reduction of mesolimbic dopaminergic activity seen in the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome. Results indicate that during the ethanol-withdrawal  syndrome the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is tonically reduced in activity, as  indexed by electrophysiological and biochemical criteria. Considering the role of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system in the reinforcing properties of ethanol, the  depressed activity of this system during the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome may be relevant to the dysphoric state associated with ethanol withdrawal in humans.", "7597046": "Abstinence from chronic administration of various drugs of abuse such as ethanol, opiates, and psychostimulants results in withdrawal syndromes largely unique to each drug class. However, one symptom that appears common to these withdrawal syndromes in humans is a negative affective/motivational state. Prior work in rodents has shown that elevations in intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) reward  thresholds provide a quantitative index that serves as a model for the negative affective state during withdrawal from psychostimulants and opiates. The current  study sought to determine whether ICSS threshold elevations also accompany abstinence from chronic ethanol exposure sufficient to induce physical dependence. Rats prepared with stimulating electrodes in the lateral hypothalamus were trained in a discrete-trial current-intensity ICSS threshold procedure; subsequently they were subjected to chronic ethanol administration in ethanol vapor chambers (average blood alcohol level of 197 mg/dl). A time-dependent elevation in ICSS thresholds was observed following removal from the ethanol, but not the control, chambers. Thresholds were significantly elevated for 48 hr after cessation of ethanol exposure, with peak elevations observed at 6-8 hr. Blood alcohol levels were directly correlated with the magnitude of peak threshold elevation. Ratings of traditional overt signs of withdrawal showed a similar time course of expression and resolution. The results suggest that decreased function  of reward systems (elevations in reward thresholds) is a common element of withdrawal from chronic administration of several diverse classes of abused drugs.", "3761194": "The effect of the i.p. administration of ethanol on the release of dopamine (DA)  and on the output of its main metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, was estimated in the rat by transcerebral dialysis of two terminal dopaminergic areas, the nucleus accumbens and the dorsal caudate. Low doses of ethanol (0.25-0.5 g/kg i.p.) stimulated DA release specifically in the n. accumbens and elicited pure behavioral stimulation. Higher doses of ethanol (1.0-2.5 g/kg) elicited sedation and hypnosis and stimulated further DA release and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid output in the accumbens and, although less, also in the caudate. High doses of ethanol (5 g/kg i.p.) elicited  long-lasting hypnosis and sedation and induced a depression followed by stimulation of DA release in the accumbens. DA release in the caudate was stimulated further. Low doses of apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg s.c.) reversed completely the stimulant effect of 0.5 g/kg of ethanol on behavior and on DA release in the accumbens. Moreover, the stimulation of behavior and of DA release in the accumbens elicited by 0.5 g/kg of ethanol were abolished completely by pretreatment with 700 mg/kg of gamma-butyrolactone, an agent which blocks DA firing and DA release. The results indicate that ethanol preferentially stimulates DA transmission in the mesolimbic system probably by activating the firing activity of mesolimbic DA neurons and provide direct evidence that these changes are involved in the motor stimulant effects of ethanol.", "3399057": "The rate of overflow and disappearance of dopamine from the extracellular fluid of the rat striatum has been measured during neuronal stimulation. Overflow of dopamine was induced by electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle with biphasic pulse trains. The instantaneous concentration of dopamine was measured with a Nafion-coated, carbon fiber microelectrode implanted in the brain. The measurement technique, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, samples the concentration of dopamine in less than 10 ms at 100 ms intervals. Identification  of dopamine is made with cyclic voltammetry. Stimulated overflow was measured as  a function of electrode position, stimulation duration, stimulation frequency, and after administration of L-DOPA and nomifensine. The observed concentration during a 2-s, 60-Hz stimulation was found to alter with position of the carbon fiber electrode. For stimuli of 3 s or less the amount of overflow was found to be a linear function of stimulus duration at a fixed electrode position. The observed overflow was found to be steady-state at a frequency of 30 Hz, suggesting a balance between uptake and synaptic overflow under these conditions. The experimental data was found to be successfully modelled when the balance of uptake and stimulated overflow was considered. It was assumed that each stimulus  pulse releases a constant amount of dopamine (125 nM), and that uptake follows a  Michaelis-Menten model for a single uptake site with Km = 200 nM and Vmax = 5 microM/s. The increase in stimulated overflow observed after L-DOPA (250 mg/kg) could be modelled by a 1.6-fold increase in the amount of dopamine release with no alteration of the uptake parameters. The increase in modelled by an increase in Km. In addition, the fit of the modelled data to the experimental data was improved when diffusion from the release and uptake sites was considered.", "1347943": "The mesolimbic dopaminergic system has been implicated in mediating the motivational effects of opioids and other drugs of abuse. The site of action of opioids within this system and the role of endogenous opioid peptides in modulating dopamine activity therein remain unknown. Employing the technique of in vivo microdialysis and the administration of highly selective opioid ligands,  the present study demonstrates the existence of tonically active and functionally opposing mu and kappa opioid systems that regulate dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, the major terminal area of A10 dopaminergic neurons. Thus, stimulation of mu-type receptors in the ventral tegmental area, the site of origin of A10 dopaminergic neurons, increases dopamine release whereas the selective blockade of this opioid receptor type results in a significant decrease in basal dopamine release. In contrast, stimulation of kappa-type receptors within the nucleus accumbens decreases dopamine release whereas their selective blockade markedly increases basal dopamine release. These data show that tonic activation of mu and kappa receptors is required for the maintenance of basal dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. In view of the postulated role of the  mesolimbic system in the mediation of drug-induced alterations in mood and affect, such findings may have implications for the treatment of opiate dependence and affective disorders.", "17956738": "While stressful life events are an important cause of psychopathology, most individuals exposed to adversity maintain normal psychological functioning. The molecular mechanisms underlying such resilience are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that an inbred population of mice subjected to social defeat can be separated into susceptible and unsusceptible subpopulations that differ along several behavioral and physiological domains. By a combination of molecular and electrophysiological techniques, we identify signature adaptations within the mesolimbic dopamine circuit that are uniquely associated with vulnerability or insusceptibility. We show that molecular recapitulations of three prototypical adaptations associated with the unsusceptible phenotype are each sufficient to promote resistant behavior. Our results validate a multidisciplinary approach to  examine the neurobiological mechanisms of variations in stress resistance, and illustrate the importance of plasticity within the brain's reward circuits in actively maintaining an emotional homeostasis.", "16501568": "To better understand the molecular mechanisms of depression and antidepressant action, we administered chronic social defeat stress followed by chronic imipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant) to mice and studied adaptations at the levels of gene expression and chromatin remodeling of five brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) splice variant mRNAs (I-V) and their unique promoters  in the hippocampus. Defeat stress induced lasting downregulation of Bdnf transcripts III and IV and robustly increased repressive histone methylation at their corresponding promoters. Chronic imipramine reversed this downregulation and increased histone acetylation at these promoters. This hyperacetylation by chronic imipramine was associated with a selective downregulation of histone deacetylase (Hdac) 5. Furthermore, viral-mediated HDAC5 overexpression in the hippocampus blocked imipramine's ability to reverse depression-like behavior. These experiments underscore an important role for histone remodeling in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression and highlight the therapeutic potential for histone methylation and deacetylation inhibitors in depression.", "16469931": "Mice experiencing repeated aggression develop a long-lasting aversion to social contact, which can be normalized by chronic, but not acute, administration of antidepressant. Using viral-mediated, mesolimbic dopamine pathway-specific knockdown of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), we showed that BDNF is required for the development of this experience-dependent social aversion. Gene profiling in the nucleus accumbens indicates that local knockdown of BDNF obliterates most of the effects of repeated aggression on gene expression within  this circuit, with similar effects being produced by chronic treatment with antidepressant. These results establish an essential role for BDNF in mediating long-term neural and behavioral plasticity in response to aversive social experiences.", "24559655": "A novel N-acetyltransferase, Shati/Nat8l, was identified in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice with methamphetamine (METH) treatment. Previously we reported that  suppression of Shati/Nat8l enhanced METH-induced behavioral alterations via dopaminergic neuronal regulation. However, the physiological mechanisms of Shati/Nat8l on the dopaminergic system in the brain are unclear. In this study, we injected adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector containing Shati/Nat8l into the NAc or dorsal striatum (dS) of mice, to increase Shati/Nat8l expression. Overexpression of Shati/Nat8l in the NAc, but not in the dS, attenuated METH-induced hyperlocomotion, locomotor sensitization, and conditioned place preference in mice. Moreover, the Shati/Nat8l overexpression in the NAc attenuated the elevation of extracellular dopamine levels induced by METH in in vivo microdialysis experiments. These behavioral and neurochemical alterations due to Shati/Nat8l overexpression in the NAc were inhibited by treatment with selective group II metabotropic glutamate receptor type 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3) antagonist LY341495. In the AAV vector-injected NAc, the tissue contents of both  N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), endogenous mGluR3 agonist, were elevated. The injection of peptidase inhibitor of NAAG or the perfusion of NAAG itself reduced the basal levels of extracellular dopamine in the NAc of naive mice. These results indicate that Shati/Nat8l in the NAc, but not in the dS, plays an important suppressive role in the behavioral responses to METH by controlling the dopaminergic system via activation of group II mGluRs.", "20399736": "VIDEO ABSTRACT: We compared brain activations in response to acute noxious thermal stimuli in controls and chronic back pain (CBP) patients. Pain perception and related cortical activation patterns were similar in the two groups. However, nucleus accumbens (NAc) activity differentiated the groups at a very high accuracy, exhibiting phasic and tonic responses with distinct properties. Positive phasic NAc activations at stimulus onset and offset tracked stimulus salience and, in normal subjects, predicted reward (pain relief) magnitude at stimulus offset. In CBP, NAc activity correlated with different cortical circuitry from that of normals and phasic activity at stimulus offset was negative in polarity, suggesting that the acute pain relieves the ongoing back pain. The relieving effect was confirmed in a separate psychophysical study in CBP. Therefore, in contrast to somatosensory pathways, which reflect sensory properties of acute noxious stimuli, NAc activity in humans encodes its predicted value and anticipates its analgesic potential on chronic pain.", "30120419": "Depression alters the structure and function of brain reward circuitry. Preclinical evidence suggests that medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) undergo structural plasticity; however, the molecular mechanism and behavioral significance is poorly understood. Here we report that atrophy of  D1, but not D2 receptor containing MSNs is strongly associated with social avoidance in mice subject to social defeat stress. D1-MSN atrophy is caused by cell-type specific upregulation of the GTPase RhoA and its effector Rho-kinase. Pharmacologic and genetic reduction of activated RhoA prevents depressive outcomes to stress by preventing loss of D1-MSN dendritic arbor. Pharmacologic and genetic promotion of activated RhoA enhances depressive outcomes by reducing  D1-MSN dendritic arbor and is sufficient to promote depressive-like behaviors in  the absence of stress. Chronic treatment with Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 after  chronic social defeat stress reverses depression-like behaviors by restoring D1-MSN dendritic complexity. Taken together, our data indicate functional roles for RhoA and Rho-kinase in mediating depression-like behaviors via dendritic remodeling of NAc D1-MSNs and may prove a useful target for new depression therapeutics.", "29268097": "Altered brain energy homeostasis is a key adaptation occurring in the cocaine-addicted brain, but the effect of cocaine on the fundamental source of energy, mitochondria, is unknown. We demonstrate an increase of dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1), the mitochondrial fission mediator, in nucleus accumbens (NAc)  after repeated cocaine exposure and in cocaine-dependent individuals. Mdivi-1, a  demonstrated fission inhibitor, blunts cocaine seeking and locomotor sensitization, while blocking c-Fos induction and excitatory input onto dopamine  receptor-1 (D1) containing NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Drp1 and fission promoting Drp1 are increased in\u00a0D1-MSNs, consistent with increased smaller mitochondria in D1-MSN dendrites after repeated cocaine. Knockdown of Drp1 in D1-MSNs blocks drug seeking after cocaine self-administration, while enhancing the fission promoting Drp1 enhances seeking after long-term abstinence from cocaine. We demonstrate a role for altered mitochondrial fission in the NAc, during early cocaine abstinence, suggesting potential therapeutic treatment of disrupting mitochondrial fission in cocaine addiction.", "27150400": "Although it is challenging for individuals with cocaine addiction to achieve abstinence, the greatest difficulty is avoiding relapse to drug taking, which is  often triggered by cues associated with prior cocaine use. This vulnerability to  relapse persists for long periods (months to years) after abstinence is achieved. Here, I discuss rodent studies of cue-induced cocaine craving during abstinence,  with a focus on neuronal plasticity in the reward circuitry that maintains high levels of craving. Such work has the potential to identify new therapeutic targets and to further our understanding of experience-dependent plasticity in the adult brain under normal circumstances and in the context of addiction.", "26044907": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has been implicated in the retrieval-induced destabilization of cocaine- and fear-related memories in Pavlovian paradigms. However, nothing is known about its role in memory retrieval after self-administration of cocaine, an operant paradigm, or how the length of withdrawal from cocaine may influence retrieval mechanisms. Here, we examined UPS activity after an extended-access cocaine self-administration regimen that leads  to withdrawal-dependent incubation of cue-induced cocaine craving. Controls self-administered saline. In initial experiments, memory retrieval was elicited via a cue-induced seeking/retrieval test on withdrawal day (WD) 50-60, when craving has incubated. We found that retrieval of cocaine- and saline-associated  memories produced similar increases in polyubiquitinated proteins in the nucleus  accumbens (NAc), compared with rats that did not undergo a seeking/retrieval test. Measures of proteasome catalytic activity confirmed similar activation of the UPS after retrieval of saline and cocaine memories. However, in a subsequent  experiment in which testing was conducted on WD1, proteasome activity in the NAc  was greater after retrieval of cocaine memory than saline memory. Analysis of other brain regions confirmed that effects of cocaine memory retrieval on proteasome activity, relative to saline memory retrieval, depend on withdrawal time. These results, combined with prior studies, suggest that the relationship between UPS activity and memory retrieval depends on training paradigm, brain region, and time elapsed between training and retrieval. The observation that mechanisms underlying cocaine memory retrieval change depending on the age of the memory has implications for development of memory destabilization therapies for cue-induced relapse in cocaine addicts.", "26030849": "Activin receptor signaling, including the transcription factor Smad3, was upregulated in the rat nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell following withdrawal from cocaine. Direct genetic and pharmacological manipulations of this pathway bidirectionally altered cocaine seeking while governing morphological plasticity  in NAc neurons. Thus, Activin/Smad3 signaling is induced following withdrawal from cocaine, and such regulation may be a key molecular mechanism underlying behavioral and cellular plasticity in the brain following cocaine self-administration.", "25995477": "An imbalance in molecular signaling cascades and transcriptional regulation in nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes, those enriched in dopamine D1 versus D2 receptors, is implicated in the behavioral responses to psychostimulants. To provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms occurring in MSN subtypes by cocaine, we examined the transcription factor early  growth response 3 (Egr3). We evaluated Egr3 because it is a target of critical cocaine-mediated signaling pathways and because Egr3-binding sites are found on promoters of key cocaine-associated molecules. We first used a RiboTag approach to obtain ribosome-associated transcriptomes from each MSN subtype and found that repeated cocaine administration induced Egr3 ribosome-associated mRNA in NAc D1-MSNs while reducing Egr3 in D2-MSNs. Using Cre-inducible adeno-associated viruses combined with D1-Cre and D2-Cre mouse lines, we observed that Egr3 overexpression in D1-MSNs enhances rewarding and locomotor responses to cocaine,  whereas overexpression in D2-MSNs blunts these behaviors. miRNA knock-down of Egr3 in MSN subtypes produced opposite behavioral responses from those observed with overexpression. Finally, we found that repeated cocaine administration altered Egr3 binding to promoters of genes that are important for cocaine-mediated cellular and behavioral plasticity. Genes with increased Egr3 binding to promoters, Camk2\u03b1, CREB, FosB, Nr4a2, and Sirt1, displayed increased mRNA in D1-MSNs and, in some cases, a reduction in D2-MSNs. Histone and the DNA methylation enzymes G9a and Dnmt3a displayed reduced Egr3 binding to their promoters and reduced mRNA in D1-MSNs. Our study provides novel insight into an opposing role of Egr3 in select NAc MSN subtypes in cocaine action.", "24270186": "Cue-induced cocaine craving is a major cause of relapse in abstinent addicts. In  rats, cue-induced craving progressively intensifies (incubates) during withdrawal from extended-access cocaine self-administration. After ~1 month of withdrawal, incubated craving is mediated by Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) that accumulate in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We found that decreased mGluR1 surface expression in the NAc preceded and enabled CP-AMPAR accumulation. Thus, restoring mGluR1 transmission by administering repeated injections of an mGluR1 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) prevented CP-AMPAR accumulation and incubation, whereas blocking mGluR1 transmission at even earlier withdrawal times accelerated CP-AMPAR accumulation. In studies conducted after prolonged withdrawal, when CP-AMPAR levels and cue-induced craving are high, we found that systemic administration of an mGluR1 PAM attenuated the expression of incubated craving by reducing CP-AMPAR transmission in the NAc to control levels. These results suggest a strategy in which recovering addicts could use a systemically active compound to protect against cue-induced relapse.", "23685858": "BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: Results from many clinical studies suggest that drug relapse and craving are often provoked by acute exposure to the self-administered drug or related drugs, drug-associated cues or contexts, or certain stressors. During the last two decades, this clinical scenario has been studied in laboratory animals by using the reinstatement model. In this model, reinstatement of drug seeking by drug priming, drug cues or contexts, or certain stressors is assessed following drug self-administration training and subsequent extinction of the drug-reinforced responding. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we first summarize recent (2009-present) neurobiological findings from studies using the reinstatement model. We then discuss emerging research topics, including the impact of interfering with putative reconsolidation processes on cue- and context-induced reinstatement of drug seeking, and similarities and differences in mechanisms of reinstatement across drug classes. We conclude by discussing results from recent human studies  that were inspired by results from rat studies using the reinstatement model. CONCLUSIONS: Main conclusions from the studies reviewed highlight: (1) the ventral subiculum and lateral hypothalamus as emerging brain areas important for  reinstatement of drug seeking, (2) the existence of differences in brain mechanisms controlling reinstatement of drug seeking across drug classes, (3) the utility of the reinstatement model for assessing the effect of reconsolidation-related manipulations on cue-induced drug seeking, and (4) the encouraging pharmacological concordance between results from rat studies using the reinstatement model and human laboratory studies on cue- and stress-induced drug craving.", "23643695": "Drug addiction involves potentially life-long behavioral abnormalities that are caused in vulnerable individuals by repeated exposure to a drug of abuse. The persistence of these behavioral changes suggests that long-lasting changes in gene expression, within particular regions of the brain, may contribute importantly to the addiction phenotype. Work over the past decade has demonstrated a crucial role for epigenetic mechanisms in driving lasting changes  in gene expression in diverse tissues, including brain. This has prompted recent  research aimed at characterizing the influence of epigenetic regulatory events in mediating the lasting effects of drugs of abuse on the brain in animal models of  drug addiction. This review provides a progress report of this still early work in the field. As will be seen, there is robust evidence that repeated exposure to drugs of abuse induces changes within the brain's reward regions in three major modes of epigenetic regulation-histone modifications such as acetylation and methylation, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNAs. In several instances, it has been possible to demonstrate directly the contribution of such epigenetic changes to addiction-related behavioral abnormalities. Studies of epigenetic mechanisms of addiction are also providing an unprecedented view of the range of genes and non-genic regions that are affected by repeated drug exposure and the precise molecular basis of that regulation. Work is now needed to validate key aspects of this work in human addiction and evaluate the possibility of mining this information to develop new diagnostic tests and more effective treatments for addiction syndromes. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'NIDA 40th  Anniversary Issue'.", "23303053": "The intense associative memories that develop between cocaine-paired contexts and rewarding stimuli contribute to cocaine seeking and relapse. Previous studies have shown impairment in cocaine reward memories by manipulating a labile state induced by memory retrieval, but the mechanisms that underlie the destabilization of cocaine reward memory are unknown. In this study, using a Pavlovian cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure in rats, we tested the contribution of ubiquitin-proteasome system-dependent protein degradation in  destabilization of cocaine reward memory. First, we found that polyubiquitinated  protein expression levels and polyubiquitinated N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion (NSF) markedly increased 15 min after retrieval while NSF protein levels decreased 1 h after retrieval in the synaptosomal membrane fraction in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core. We then found that infusion of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin into the NAc core prevented the impairment of memory reconsolidation induced by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin and reversed the effects of anisomycin on NSF and glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) protein levels in the synaptosomal membrane fraction in the NAc core. We also found that lactacystin infusion into the NAc core but not into the shell immediately after extinction training sessions inhibited CPP extinction and reversed the extinction training-induced decrease in NSF and GluR2 in the synaptosomal membrane fraction in the NAc core. Finally, infusions of lactacystin by itself into the NAc core immediately after each training session or before the CPP retrieval test had no effect on the consolidation and retrieval of cocaine reward memory. These findings suggest that ubiquitin-proteasome system-dependent  protein degradation is critical for retrieval-induced memory destabilization.", "22522400": "Repeated cocaine administration increases the dendritic arborization of nucleus accumbens neurons, but the underlying signaling events remain unknown. Here we show that repeated exposure to cocaine negatively regulates the active form of Rac1, a small GTPase that controls actin remodeling in other systems. Further, we show, using viral-mediated gene transfer, that overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 or local knockout of Rac1 is sufficient to increase the density of immature dendritic spines on nucleus accumbens neurons, whereas overexpression of a constitutively active Rac1 or light activation of a photoactivatable form of Rac1 blocks the ability of repeated cocaine exposure to  produce this effect. Downregulation of Rac1 activity likewise promotes behavioral responses to cocaine exposure, with activation of Rac1 producing the opposite effect. These findings establish that Rac1 signaling mediates structural and behavioral plasticity in response to cocaine exposure.", "21989194": "Investigations of long-term changes in brain structure and function that accompany chronic exposure to drugs of abuse suggest that alterations in gene regulation contribute substantially to the addictive phenotype. Here, we review multiple mechanisms by which drugs alter the transcriptional potential of genes.  These mechanisms range from the mobilization or repression of the transcriptional machinery - including the transcription factors \u0394FOSB, cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) - to epigenetics - including alterations in the accessibility of genes within their native chromatin structure induced by histone tail modifications and DNA methylation, and the regulation of gene expression by non-coding RNAs. Increasing evidence implicates  these various mechanisms of gene regulation in the lasting changes that drugs of  abuse induce in the brain, and offers novel inroads for addiction therapy.", "21276808": "Cue-induced cocaine seeking intensifies or incubates after withdrawal from extended access cocaine self-administration, a phenomenon termed incubation of cocaine craving. The expression of incubated craving is mediated by Ca\u00b2\u207a-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Thus, CP-AMPARs are a potential target for therapeutic intervention, making it important to understand mechanisms that govern their accumulation. Here we used subcellular fractionation and biotinylation of NAc tissue to examine the abundance and distribution of AMPAR subunits, and GluA1 phosphorylation, in the incubation model. We also studied two transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs), \u03b3-2 and \u03b3-4. Our results, together with earlier findings, suggest that some of the new CP-AMPARs are synaptic. These are probably associated with \u03b3-2, but they are loosely tethered to the PSD. Levels of GluA1 phosphorylated at serine 845 (pS845 GluA1) were significantly increased in biotinylated tissue and in an extrasynaptic membrane-enriched fraction. These results suggest that increased synaptic levels of CP-AMPARs may result in part from an increase in pS845 GluA1 in extrasynaptic membranes, given that S845 phosphorylation primes GluA1-containing AMPARs for synaptic insertion and extrasynaptic AMPARs supply the synapse. Some of the new extrasynaptic CP-AMPARs  are likely associated with \u03b3-4, rather than \u03b3-2. The maintenance of CP-AMPARs in  NAc synapses during withdrawal is accompanied by activation of CaMKII and ERK2 but not CaMKI. Overall, AMPAR plasticity in the incubation model shares some features with better described forms of synaptic plasticity, although the timing  of the phenomenon and the persistence of related neuroadaptations are significantly different.", "19674091": "Synaptic scaling has been proposed as a form of plasticity that may contribute to drug addiction but it has not been previously demonstrated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical region for addiction. Here we demonstrate bidirectional synaptic scaling in postnatal rat NAc neurons that were co-cultured with prefrontal cortical neurons to restore excitatory input. Prolonged activity  blockade (1-3 days) with an AMPA receptor antagonist increased cell surface (synaptic and extrasynaptic) glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) and GluR2 but not GluR3, as well as GluR1/2 co-localization on the cell surface and total GluR1 and GluR2 protein levels. A prolonged increase in activity (bicuculline, 48 h) produced opposite effects. These results suggest that GluR1/2-containing AMPA receptors undergo synaptic scaling in NAc neurons. GluR1 and GluR2 surface expression was also increased by tetrodotoxin alone or in combination with an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor or AMPA receptor antagonist but not by the l-type Ca(2+) channel antagonist nifedipine. A cobalt-quenching assay confirmed the immunocytochemical results indicating that synaptic scaling after activity blockade did not involve a change in abundance of GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors. Increased AMPA receptor surface expression after activity blockade required protein synthesis and was occluded by inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Repeated dopamine (DA) treatment, which leads to upregulation of surface  GluR1 and GluR2, occluded activity blockade-induced synaptic scaling. These latter results indicate an interaction between cellular mechanisms involved in synaptic scaling and adaptive mechanisms triggered by repeated DA receptor stimulation, suggesting that synaptic scaling may not function normally after exposure to DA-releasing drugs such as cocaine.", "16251986": "Drugs of abuse have very different acute mechanisms of action but converge on the brain's reward pathways by producing a series of common functional effects after  both acute and chronic administration. Some similar actions occur for natural rewards as well. Researchers are making progress in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of these common effects. A major goal for future research is to determine whether such common underpinnings of addiction can be exploited for  the development of more effective treatments for a wide range of addictive disorders.", "16206910": "There is an enormous initiative to establish the genetic basis for disorders of brain function. Unfortunately, genetic intervention is not accomplished easily in the nervous system. One strategy is to engineer and deliver to neurons specialized viral vectors that carry a gene (or genes) of interest, thereby exploiting the natural ability of viruses to insert genetic material into cells.  When delivered to brain cells, these vectors cause infected cells to increase the expression of the genes of interest. The ability to deliver genes into neurons in vitro and in vivo with herpes simplex virus (HSV) amplicon vectors has made it possible to carry out exactly these sorts of experiments. This technology has the potential to offer new insights into the etiology of a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. We describe the use of HSV amplicon vectors to study  Alzheimer disease, drug addiction, and depression, and discuss the considerations that enter into the use of these vectors both in vitro and in vivo. The HSV amplicon virus is a user-friendly vector for the delivery of genes into neurons that has come of age for the study of brain function.", "11169774": "We studied the influence of cocaine use on the structure of neurons in brain regions that contribute to its rewarding effects by allowing rats to self-administer cocaine (0.33 mg/infusion) for 1 h a day for 1 month. Control animals were left undisturbed or allowed to work for food for the same period of  time. After an additional 1 month drug-free period the brains were processed for  Golgi-Cox staining. In rats that self-administered cocaine, but not rats that worked for food, there was a significant increase in dendritic branching and in the density of dendritic spines on medium spiny neurons in the shell of the nucleus accumbens and on pyramidal cells in the prefrontal and parietal (but not  occipital) cortex. There was also a 2.6-fold increase in the incidence of spines  with multiple heads (branched spines) on medium spiny neurons. Finally, in the prefrontal cortex some of the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells appeared misshaped, having large bulbous structures on their terminal tips. We speculate that cocaine self-administration experience alters patterns of synaptic connectivity within limbocortical circuitry that is thought to contribute to cocaine's incentive motivational effects and may have neuropathological effects in frontal areas involved in decision making and judgment. Together, these two classes of drug-induced neuroadaptations may contribute to the development of addiction.", "29975170": "The nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) is a striatal brain region essential for integrating motivated behavior and reward processing with premotor function. In humans and rodents, research has identified sex differences and sex steroid hormone sensitivity in AcbC-mediated behaviors, in disorders, and in rats in the  electrophysiological properties of the AcbC output neuron type, the medium spiny  neuron (MSN). It is unknown whether the sex differences detected in MSN electrophysiological properties extend to mice. Furthermore, MSNs come in distinct subtypes with subtle differences in electrophysiological properties, and it is unknown whether MSN subtype-specific electrophysiology varies by sex. To address these questions, we used male and female Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 bacterial  artificial chromosome transgenic mice. We made acute brain slices of the AcbC, and performed whole cell patch-clamp recordings across MSN subtypes to comprehensively assess AcbC MSN subtype electrophysiological properties. We found that ( 1 mice MSNs did not exhibit the sex differences detected in rat MSNs, and  2) electrophysiological properties differed between MSN subtypes in both sexes, including rheobase, resting membrane potential, action potential properties, intrinsic excitability, input resistance in both the linear and rectified ranges, and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current properties. These findings significantly extend previous studies of MSN subtypes performed in males or animals of undetermined sex and indicate that the influence of sex upon AcbC MSN  properties varies between rodent species. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This research provides the most comprehensive assessment of medium spiny neuron subtype electrophysiological properties to date in a critical brain region, the nucleus accumbens core. It additionally represents the first evaluation of whether mouse  medium spiny neuron subtype electrophysiological properties differ by sex.", "29947588": "Naturally occurring hormone cycles in adult female humans and rodents create a dynamic neuroendocrine environment. These cycles include the menstrual cycle in humans and its counterpart in rodents, the estrous cycle. These hormone fluctuations induce sex differences in the phenotypes of many behaviors, including those related to motivation, and associated disorders such as depression and addiction. This suggests that the neural substrate instrumental for these behaviors, including the nucleus accumbens core (AcbC), likewise differs between estrous cycle phases. It is unknown whether the electrophysiological properties of AcbC output neurons, medium spiny neurons (MSNs), change between estrous cycle phases. This is a critical knowledge gap given that MSN electrophysiological properties are instrumental for determining AcbC output to efferent targets. Here we test whether the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of adult rat AcbC MSNs differ across female estrous cycle phases and from males. We recorded MSNs with whole cell patch-clamp technique in two experiments, the first using gonad-intact adult males and females in differing phases of the estrous cycle and the second using gonadectomized males and females in which the estrous cycle was eliminated. MSN intrinsic electrophysiological and excitatory synaptic input properties robustly  changed between female estrous cycle phases and males. Sex differences in MSN electrophysiology disappeared when the estrous cycle was eliminated. These novel  findings indicate that AcbC MSN electrophysiological properties change across the estrous cycle, providing a new framework for understanding how biological sex and hormone cyclicity regulate motivated behaviors and other AcbC functions and disorders. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This research is the first demonstration that medium  spiny neuron electrophysiological properties change across adult female hormone cycle phases in any striatal region. This influence of estrous cycle engenders sex differences in electrophysiological properties that are eliminated by gonadectomy. Broadly, these findings indicate that adult female hormone cycles are an important factor for neurophysiology.", "29720962": "Steroid sex hormones and biological sex influence how the brain regulates motivated behavior, reward, and sensorimotor function in both normal and pathological contexts. Investigations into the underlying neural mechanisms have  targeted the striatal brain regions, including the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens core (AcbC), and shell. These brain regions are of particular interest  to neuroendocrinologists given that they express membrane-associated but not nuclear estrogen receptors, and also the well-established role of the sex steroid hormone 17\u03b2-estradiol (estradiol) in modulating striatal dopamine systems. Indeed, output neurons of the striatum, the medium spiny neurons (MSNs), exhibit  estradiol sensitivity and sex differences in electrophysiological properties. Here, we review sex differences in rat MSN glutamatergic synaptic input and intrinsic excitability across striatal regions, including evidence for estradiol-mediated sexual differentiation in the nucleus AcbC. In prepubertal animals, female MSNs in the caudate-putamen exhibit a greater intrinsic excitability relative to male MSNs, but no sex differences are detected in excitatory synaptic input. Alternatively, female MSNs in the nucleus AcbC exhibit increased excitatory synaptic input relative to male MSNs, but no sex differences in intrinsic excitability were detected. Increased excitatory synaptic input onto female MSNs in the nucleus AcbC is abolished after masculinizing estradiol or testosterone exposure during the neonatal critical period. No sex differences are detected in MSNs in prepubertal nucleus accumbens shell. Thus, despite possessing the same neuron type, striatal regions exhibit heterogeneity in sex differences in MSN electrophysiological properties, which likely contribute to the sex differences observed in striatal function.", "29626485": "Contribution to Special Issue on Fast effects of steroids. Estradiol and progesterone rapidly induce changes in dopaminergic signaling within the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens of female rats. In ovariectomized females, estradiol rapidly enhances dopamine release and modulates binding of dopamine receptors. Progesterone further potentiates the effect of estradiol on dopamine release. The effects of both estradiol and progesterone are time course dependent, with increases in dopamine release immediately after acute hormone administration followed by later inhibition of dopamine release. Importantly, these changes are also seen in naturally cycling females, indicating their importance for normal physiological states and relevant reproductive behaviors. Here, we summarize the literature establishing the rapid effects of estradiol and progesterone on dopamine release and receptor expression in dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens of both males and females. Integrating this literature with the larger body of work focusing on dopamine regulated behaviors, we propose hypotheses for adaptive reasons (i.e., ultimate causes) as to why changes in ovarian hormones modulate dopamine release. Finally, we note the importance of these studies for understanding sex differences in vulnerability to drug addiction. Research on how dopaminergic systems regulate behavior in both males and females is crucial for developing a full appreciation of dopamine's role in both natural and drug-induced behaviors.", "28323008": "Men and women manifest different symptoms of depression and under current diagnostic criteria, depression is twice as prevalent in woman. However, little is known of the mechanisms contributing to these important sex differences. Sub-chronic variable stress (SCVS), a rodent model of depression, induces depression-like behaviors in female mice only, modeling clinical evidence of higher susceptibility to mood disorders in women. Accumulating evidence indicates that altered neuroplasticity of excitatory synapses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key pathophysiological feature of susceptibility to social stress in males. Here we investigated the effects of SCVS on pre- and post-synaptic protein levels and morphology of glutamatergic synapses of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc of female and male mice. Animals underwent six-day exposure to alternating stressors including shock, tail suspension and restraint. MSNs from the NAc were filled with a Lucifer yellow dye and spine density and type were examined using NeuronStudio. In a separate group of animals, immunofluorescence staining was performed for vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), in order to label cortical and subcortical glutamatergic terminals. Immunostaining for post-synaptic density 95  (PSD95) was employed to evaluate post-synaptic density. Females demonstrated circuit-specific pre-synaptic alterations in VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 containing synapses that may contribute to stress susceptibility in the absence of post-synaptic alterations in PSD95 puncta, spine density or type. These data indicate that susceptibility to stress in females is associated with changes in the frequency of distinct glutamatergic inputs to the NAc.", "28072417": "Although both males and females become addicted to cocaine, females transition to addiction faster and experience greater difficulties remaining abstinent. We demonstrate an oestrous cycle-dependent mechanism controlling increased cocaine reward in females. During oestrus, ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neuron activity is enhanced and drives post translational modifications at the dopamine  transporter (DAT) to increase the ability of cocaine to inhibit its function, an  effect mediated by estradiol. Female mice conditioned to associate cocaine with contextual cues during oestrus have enhanced mesolimbic responses to these cues in the absence of drug. Using chemogenetic approaches, we increase VTA activity to mechanistically link oestrous cycle-dependent enhancement of VTA firing to enhanced cocaine affinity at DAT and subsequent reward processing. These data have implications for sexual dimorphism in addiction vulnerability and define a mechanism by which cellular activity results in protein alterations that contribute to dysfunctional learning and reward processing.", "27363441": "The nucleus accumbens is a major input structure of the basal ganglia and integrates information from cortical and limbic structures to mediate goal-directed behaviors. Chronic exposure to several classes of drugs of abuse disrupts plasticity in this region, allowing drug-associated cues to engender a pathologic motivation for drug seeking. A number of alterations in glutamatergic  transmission occur within the nucleus accumbens after withdrawal from chronic drug exposure. These drug-induced neuroadaptations serve as the molecular basis for relapse vulnerability. In this review, we focus on the role that glutamate signal transduction in the nucleus accumbens plays in addiction-related behaviors. First, we explore the nucleus accumbens, including the cell types and  neuronal populations present as well as afferent and efferent connections. Next we discuss rodent models of addiction and assess the viability of these models for testing candidate pharmacotherapies for the prevention of relapse. Then we provide a review of the literature describing how synaptic plasticity in the accumbens is altered after exposure to drugs of abuse and withdrawal and also how pharmacological manipulation of glutamate systems in the accumbens can inhibit drug seeking in the laboratory setting. Finally, we examine results from clinical trials in which pharmacotherapies designed to manipulate glutamate systems have been effective in treating relapse in human patients. Further elucidation of how  drugs of abuse alter glutamatergic plasticity within the accumbens will be necessary for the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of addiction  across all classes of addictive substances.", "27285859": "Steroid sex hormones and genetic sex regulate the phenotypes of motivated behaviors and relevant disorders. Most studies seeking to elucidate the underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms have focused on how 17\u03b2-estradiol modulates  the role of dopamine in striatal brain regions, which express membrane-associated estrogen receptors. Dopamine action is an important component of striatal function, but excitatory synaptic neurotransmission has also emerged as a key striatal substrate and target of estradiol action. Here, we focus on excitatory synaptic input onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatal region nucleus accumbens core (AcbC). In adult AcbC, miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency is increased in female compared with male MSNs. We tested whether increased mEPSC frequency in female MSNs exists before puberty, whether this increased excitability is due to the absence of estradiol or testosterone during the early developmental critical period, and whether it is accompanied by  stable neuron intrinsic membrane properties. We found that mEPSC frequency is increased in female compared with male MSNs before puberty. Increased mEPSC frequency in female MSNs is abolished after neonatal estradiol or testosterone exposure. MSN intrinsic membrane properties did not differ by sex. These data indicate that neonatal masculinization via estradiol and/or testosterone action is sufficient for down-regulating excitatory synaptic input onto MSNs. We conclude that excitatory synaptic input onto AcbC MSNs is organized long before adulthood via steroid sex hormone action, providing new insight into a mechanism  by which sex differences in motivated behavior and other AbcC functions may be generated or compromised.", "27080432": "Estrogens affect dopamine transmission in the striatum, increasing dopamine availability, maintaining D2 receptor density, and reducing the availability of the dopamine transporter. Some of these effects of estrogens are rapid, suggesting that they are mediated by membrane associated receptors. Recently our  group demonstrated that there is extra-nuclear labeling for ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2, and GPER1 in the striatum, but that ER\u03b1 and GPER1 are not localized to dopaminergic neurons in this region. GABAergic neurons are the most common type of neuron in the striatum, and changes in GABA transmission affect dopamine transmission. Thus, to determine whether ER\u03b1 or GPER1 are localized to GABAergic neurons, we double labeled the striatum with antibodies for ER\u03b1 or GPER1 and GABA and examined them  using electron microscopy. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that ER\u03b1 and GPER1 are localized exclusively to extranuclear sites in the striatum, and \u223c35% of the  dendrites and axon terminals labeled for these receptors contain GABA immunoreactivity. Binding at membrane-associated ER\u03b1 and GPER1 could account for  rapid estrogen-induced decreases in GABA transmission in the striatum, which, in  turn, could affect dopamine transmission in this region.", "27022621": "Sex differences exist in how the brain regulates motivated behavior and reward, both in normal and pathological contexts. Investigations into the underlying neural mechanisms have targeted the striatal brain regions, including the dorsal  striatum and nucleus accumbens core and shell. These investigations yield accumulating evidence of sexually different electrophysiological properties, excitatory synaptic input, and sensitivity to neuromodulator/hormone action in select striatal regions both before and after puberty. It is unknown whether the  electrical properties of neurons in the nucleus accumbens shell differ by sex, and whether sex differences in excitatory synaptic input are present before puberty. To test the hypothesis that these properties differ by sex, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on male and female medium spiny neurons (MSNs)  in acute brain slices obtained from prepubertal rat nucleus accumbens shell. We analyzed passive and active electrophysiological properties, and miniature EPSCs  (mEPSCs). No sex differences were detected; this includes those properties, such  as intrinsic excitability, action potential afterhyperpolarization, threshold, and mEPSC frequency, that have been found to differ by sex in other striatal regions and/or developmental periods. These findings indicate that, unlike other  striatal brain regions, the electrophysiological properties of nucleus accumbens  shell MSNs do not differ by sex. Overall, it appears that sex differences in striatal function, including motivated behavior and reward, are likely mediated by other factors and striatal regions.", "26666530": "Sex differences are widespread across vertebrate nervous systems. Such differences are sometimes reflected in the neural substrate via neuroanatomical differences in brain region volume. One brain region that displays sex differences in its associated functions and pathologies is the striatum, including the caudate-putamen (dorsal striatum), nucleus accumbens core and shell\u00a0(ventral striatum). The extent to which these differences can be attributed to alterations in volume is unclear. We thus tested whether the volumes of the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens core, and nucleus accumbens shell differed by  region, sex, and hemisphere in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. As a positive control for detecting sex differences in brain region volume, we measured the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the medial preoptic area (SDN-POA). As expected, SDN-POA volume was larger in males than in females. No sex differences were detected in the volumes of the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens core or shell. Nucleus accumbens core volume was larger in the right than left hemisphere across males and females. These findings complement previous reports of lateralized nucleus accumbens volume in humans, and suggest that this may possibly be driven via hemispheric differences in nucleus accumbens core volume. In contrast, striatal sex differences seem to be mediated by factors other than striatal region volume. This conclusion is presented within the context of a detailed review of studies addressing sex differences and similarities in striatal neuroanatomy.", "26074768": "17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), a neurosteroid synthesized by P450-aromatase (ARO), modulates various brain functions. We characterized the role of the locally synthesized E2  on striatal long-term synaptic plasticity and explored possible interactions between E2 receptors (ERs) and dopamine (DA) receptors in the dorsal striatum of  adult male rats. Inhibition of E2 synthesis or antagonism of ERs prevented the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in both medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and cholinergic interneurons (ChIs). Activation of a D1-like DA receptor/cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway restored LTP. In MSNs exogenous E2 reversed the effect of ARO inhibition. Also antagonism of M1 muscarinic receptors prevented the D1-like receptor-mediated restoration of LTP confirming a role for  ChIs in controlling the E2-mediated LTP of MSNs. A novel striatal interaction, occurring between ERs and D1-like receptors in both MSNs and ChIs, might be critical to regulate basal ganglia physiology and to compensate synaptic alterations in Parkinson's disease.", "25540977": "The gonadal hormone estradiol modulates mesolimbic dopamine systems in the female rat. This modulatory effect is thought to be responsible for the observed effects of estradiol on motivated behaviors. Dopamine acting in the nucleus accumbens is  thought to be important for the attribution of incentive motivational properties  to cues that predict reward delivery, while dopamine in the striatum is associated with the expression of repetitive or stereotyped behaviors. Elevated concentrations of estradiol are associated with increased motivation for sex or cues associated with access to a mate, while simultaneously attenuating motivation for food. This shift in motivational salience is important for adaptive choice behavior in the natural environment. Additionally, estradiol's adaptive effects on motivation can be maladaptive when increasing motivation for  non-natural reinforcers, such as drugs of abuse. Here we discuss the effect of estradiol on mesotelencephalic dopamine transmission and subsequent effects on motivated behaviors.", "25376786": "Sex differences in neuron electrophysiological properties were traditionally associated with brain regions directly involved in reproduction in adult, postpubertal animals. There is growing acknowledgement that sex differences can exist in other developmental periods and brain regions as well. This includes the dorsal striatum (caudate/putamen), which shows robust sex differences in gene expression, neuromodulator action (including dopamine and 17\u03b2-estradiol), and relevant sensorimotor behaviors and pathologies such as the responsiveness to drugs of abuse. Here we examine whether these sex differences extend to striatal  neuron electrophysiology. We test the hypothesis that passive and active medium spiny neuron (MSN) electrophysiological properties in prepubertal rat dorsal striatum differ by sex. We made whole cell recordings from male and females MSNs  from acute brain slices. The slope of the evoked firing rate to current injection curve was increased in MSNs recorded from females compared with males. The initial action potential firing rate was increased in MSNs recorded from females  compared with males. Action potential after-hyperpolarization peak was decreased, and threshold was hyperpolarized in MSNs recorded from females compared with males. No sex differences in passive electrophysiological properties or miniature excitatory synaptic currents were detected. These findings indicate that MSN excitability is increased in prepubertal females compared with males, providing a new mechanism that potentially contributes to generating sex differences in striatal-mediated processes. Broadly, these findings demonstrate that sex differences in neuron electrophysiological properties can exist prepuberty in brain regions not directly related to reproduction.", "24332790": "BACKGROUND: Females exhibit more rapid escalation of cocaine use and enhanced cocaine-taking behavior as compared to males. While ovarian hormones likely play  a role in this increased vulnerability, research has yet to examine the role of estradiol in affecting the behavioral and neurological response to cocaine in a brain region- and sex-specific way. METHODS: First, we examined stereotypy and locomotor sensitization after repeated cocaine administration (10 mg/kg i.p.) in intact (SHAM) and castrated (CAST) males, and ovariectomized (OVX) females treated with 5 \u03bcg estradiol benzoate (EB) or vehicle (OIL). Next, we used in vivo microdialysis to examine the effects of acute EB treatment on cocaine-induced DA in the regions mediating the display of  these behaviors (i.e., the dorsolateral striatum, DLS; and the nucleus accumbens, NAc; respectively). RESULTS: We find that EB enhances sensitization of cocaine-induced stereotypy in  OVX females after 12 days of cocaine treatment, and after a 10-day withdrawal. Similarly, the OVX/EB females show enhanced locomotor sensitization compared to the other three groups on the same days. Using in vivo microdialysis to assess the neurochemical response, we find that EB rapidly enhances cocaine-induced DA in DLS dialysate of OVX females but not CAST males, and has no effect in NAc of either sex. CONCLUSIONS: With these experiments, we show that there are sex differences in the effects of estradiol to preferentially enhance the response to cocaine in the DLS over the NAc in females, which may contribute to the preferential sensitization of stereotypy in females.", "23942470": "Mood disorders are common and debilitating conditions characterized in part by profound deficits in reward-related behavioural domains. A recent literature has  identified important structural and functional alterations within the brain's reward circuitry--particularly in the ventral tegmental area-nucleus accumbens pathway--that are associated with symptoms such as anhedonia and aberrant reward-associated perception and memory. This Review synthesizes recent data from human and rodent studies from which emerges a circuit-level framework for understanding reward deficits in depression. We also discuss some of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of this framework, ranging from adaptations  in glutamatergic synapses and neurotrophic factors to transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms.", "22919059": "Estrogens rapidly affect dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum (dSTR) and DA-related diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. How estrogens influence DA function remains unclear, in part, because the ultrastructural localization of estrogen receptors (ER) in the dSTR is not known. Light microscopic studies of the dSTR have suggested the presence of ER. This experiment used electron microscopy to determine whether these ER are at extranuclear sites in the dSTR, providing evidence for a mechanism through which  estrogen could rapidly affect DA transmission. The dSTR was labeled with antibodies for ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2, and G protein-coupled ER 1 (GPER-1) to confirm whether these ER were present in this brain area. After this, the dSTR was dual labeled with antibodies for ER\u03b1 or GPER-1 and tyrosine hydroxylase or vesicular acetylcholine transporter to determine whether ER are localized to dopaminergic and/or cholinergic processes, respectively. Ultrastructural analysis revealed immunoreactivity (IR) for ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2, and GPER-1 exclusively at extranuclear sites  throughout the dSTR. ER\u03b1-, ER\u03b2-, and GPER-1-IR are mostly frequently observed in  axons and glial profiles but are also localized to other neuronal profiles. Dual  labeling revealed that ER\u03b1- and GPER-1-IR is not associated with DA axons and terminals but is sometimes associated with cholinergic neurons. Because these receptors are exclusively extranuclear in the dSTR, binding at these receptors likely affects neurotransmission via nongenomic mechanisms.", "22186416": "There is growing appreciation that estrogen signaling pathways can be modulated by naturally occurring environmental compounds such as phytoestrogens and the more recently discovered xenoestrogens. Many researchers studying the effects of  estrogens on brain function or behavior in animal models choose to use phytoestrogen-free food for this reason. Corncob bedding is commonly used in animal facilities across the United States and has been shown to inhibit estrogen-dependent reproductive behavior in rats. The mechanism for this effect was unclear, because the components of corncob bedding mediating this effect did  not bind estrogen receptors. Here, we show in the California mouse (Peromyscus californicus) that estrogens decrease aggression when cardboard-based bedding is  used but that this effect is absent when corncob bedding is used. California mice housed on corncob bedding also had fewer estrogen receptor-\u03b1-positive cells in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and ventromedial hypothalamus compared with mice housed on cardboard-based bedding. In addition, corncob bedding suppressed the expression of phosphorylated ERK in these brain regions as well as in the medial amygdala and medial preoptic area. Previous reports of the effects  of corncob bedding on reproductive behavior are not widely appreciated. Our observations on the effects of corncob bedding on behavior and brain function should draw attention to the importance that cage bedding can exert on neuroendocrine research.", "21987050": "Despite robust sex differences in behavioral responses to drugs of abuse, relatively little is known about structural sex differences in synaptic connectivity of reward circuits such as in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Previously, we showed that distal dendritic spine density on medium spiny neurons in the NAc is higher in females than males, suggesting that sex differences in NAc excitatory synapses could play a role in differential behavioral responses to drugs. In the current study, we used electron microscopy and stereological counting methods to evaluate dendritic spine and shaft synapses, as well as tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-IR) profiles, in the NAc core of male and female rats. We found an unanticipated rostro-caudal gradient in spine synapse density in females but not males, resulting in a sex difference favoring females  in the caudal NAc core. The volume of the NAc was not different between males and females. We also found that the percentage of spines with large spine heads was greater in females in the rostral core. The density of shaft synapses was low compared to spine synapses, and sex differences were minor. The density of TH-IR  profiles was not different between males and females, but females had a higher proportion of spines with large heads near TH suggesting a potential sex difference in dopaminergic modulation of large spine synapses. These findings underscore the importance of including both males and females in studies of reward circuitry, and of considering variation along the rostro-caudal axis of the NAc in future studies.", "20953625": "Estradiol affects a variety of brain regions by modulating physiological and cellular functions as well as neuronal morphology. Within the striatum, estradiol is known to induce physiological and molecular changes, yet estradiol's effects on striatal dendritic morphology have not yet been evaluated. Using ballistic delivery of the lipophilic dye DiI to tissue sections, we were able to evaluate estradiol's effects on striatal morphology in female Syrian hamsters. We found that estradiol significantly decreased spine density within the nucleus accumbens core, with no effect in the nucleus accumbens shell or caudate. Interestingly, estradiol treatment caused a significant deconstruction of spines from more to less mature spine subtypes in both the nucleus accumbens core and shell regardless of changes in spine density. These results are significant in that they offer a novel mechanism for estradiol actions on a wide variety of nucleus accumbens functions such as motivation or reward as well as their pathological consequences (e.g. drug addiction).", "20951763": "Both hemispheric bias and sex differences exist in striatal-mediated behaviors and pathologies. The extent to which these dimorphisms can be attributed to an underlying neuroanatomical difference is unclear. We therefore quantified neuron  soma size and density in the dorsal striatum (CPu) as well as the core (AcbC) and shell (AcbS) subregions of the nucleus accumbens to determine whether these anatomical measurements differ by region, hemisphere, or sex in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Neuron soma size was larger in the CPu than the AcbC or AcbS. Neuron density was greatest in the AcbS, intermediate in the AcbC, and least dense in the CPu. CPu neuron density was greater in the left in comparison  to the right hemisphere. No attribute was sexually dimorphic. These results provide the first evidence that hemispheric bias in the striatum and striatal-mediated behaviors can be attributed to a lateralization in neuronal density within the CPu. In contrast, sexual dimorphisms appear mediated by factors other than gross anatomical differences.", "20220002": "Drug-induced malfunction of nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons underlies a key pathophysiology of drug addiction. Drug-induced changes in intrinsic membrane excitability of NAc neurons are thought to be critical for producing behavioral alterations. Previous studies demonstrate that, after short-term (2 d) or long-term (21 d) withdrawal from noncontingent cocaine injection, the intrinsic membrane excitability of NAc shell (NAcSh) neurons is decreased, and decreased membrane excitability of NAcSh neurons increases the acute locomotor response to  cocaine. However, animals exhibit distinct cellular and behavioral alterations at different stages of cocaine exposure, suggesting that the decreased membrane excitability of NAc neurons may not be a persistent change. Here, we demonstrate  that the membrane excitability of NAcSh neurons is differentially regulated depending on whether cocaine is administered contingently or noncontingently. Specifically, the membrane excitability of NAcSh medium spiny neurons (MSNs) was  decreased at 2 d after withdrawal from either 5 d intraperitoneal injections (15  mg/kg) or cocaine self-administration (SA). At 21 d of withdrawal, the membrane excitability of NAcSh MSNs, which remained low in intraperitoneally pretreated rats, returned to a normal level in SA-pretreated rats. Furthermore, after a reexposure to cocaine after long-term withdrawal, the membrane excitability of NAcSh MSNs instantly returned to a normal level in intraperitoneally pretreated rats. Conversely, in SA-pretreated rats, the reexposure elevated the membrane excitability of NAcSh MSMs beyond the normal level. These results suggest that the dynamic alterations in membrane excitability of NAcSh MSNs, together with the dynamic changes in synaptic input, contribute differentially to the behavioral consequences of contingent and noncontingent cocaine administration.", "20151363": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a central role in motivation and reward. While  there is ample evidence for sex differences in addiction-related behaviors, little is known about the neuroanatomical substrates that underlie these sexual dimorphisms. We investigated sex differences in synaptic connectivity of the NAc  by evaluating pre- and postsynaptic measures in gonadally intact male and proestrous female rats. We used DiI labeling and confocal microscopy to measure dendritic spine density, spine head size, dendritic length, and branching of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc, and quantitative immunofluorescence to measure glutamatergic innervation using pre- (vesicular glutamate transporter 1 and 2) and postsynaptic (postsynaptic density 95) markers, as well as dopaminergic innervation of the NAc. We also utilized electron microscopy to complement the above measures. Clear but subtle sex differences were identified,  namely, in distal dendritic spine density and the proportion of large spines on MSNs, both of which are greater in females. Sex differences in spine density and  spine head size are evident in both the core and shell subregions, but are stronger in the core. This study is the first demonstration of neuroanatomical sex differences in the NAc and provides evidence that structural differences in synaptic connectivity and glutamatergic input may contribute to behavioral sex differences in reward and addiction.", "19458226": "Steroid sex hormones drive changes in the nervous system and behavior in many animal taxa, but integrating the former with the latter remains challenging. One  useful model system for meeting this challenge is seasonally breeding songbirds.  In these species, plasma testosterone levels rise and fall across the seasons, altering song behavior and causing dramatic growth and regression of the song-control system, a discrete set of nuclei that control song behavior. Whereas the cellular mechanisms underlying changes in nucleus volume have been studied as a model for neural growth and degeneration, it is unknown whether these changes in neural structure are accompanied by changes in electrophysiological properties other than spontaneous firing rate. Here we test the hypothesis that passive and  active neuronal properties in the forebrain song-control nuclei HVC and RA change across breeding conditions. We exposed adult male Gambel's white-crowned sparrows to either short-day photoperiod or long-day photoperiod and systemic testosterone to simulate nonbreeding and breeding conditions, respectively. We made whole-cell recordings from RA and HVC neurons in acute brain slices. We found that RA projection neuron membrane time constant, capacitance, and evoked and spontaneous firing rates were all increased in the breeding condition; the measured electrophysiological properties of HVC interneurons and projection neurons were stable across breeding conditions. This combination of plastic and stable intrinsic properties could directly impact the song-control system's motor control across seasons, underlying changes in song stereotypy.

Estradiol can also exert effects within seconds to minutes, however, a timescale incongruent with genomic signaling. In the brain, estradiol rapidly potentiates stimulated dopamine release in the striatum of female rats and enhances spontaneous rotational behavior. Furthermore, estradiol rapidly attenuates the K(+)-evoked increase of GABA in dialysate. We hypothesize that these rapid effects of estradiol in the striatum are mediated by ERalpha located on the membrane of medium spiny GABAergic neurons. This experiment examined whether overexpression of ERalpha in the striatum would enhance the effect of estradiol on rotational behavior and the K(+)-evoked increase in GABA in dialysate. Ovariectomized female rats were tested for rotational behavior or underwent microdialysis experiments after unilateral intrastriatal injections of a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing the human ERalpha cDNA (AAV.ERalpha) into the striatum; controls received either the same vector into areas outside the striatum or an AAV containing the human alkaline phosphatase gene into the striatum (AAV.ALP). Animals that received AAV.ERalpha in the striatum exhibited significantly greater estradiol-induced contralateral rotations compared with controls and exhibited behavioral sensitization of contralateral rotations induced by a low-dose of amphetamine. ERalpha overexpression also enhanced the inhibitory effect of estradiol on K(+)-evoked GABA release suggesting that disinhibition of dopamine release from terminals in the striatum resulted in the enhanced rotational behavior.", "17904621": "Sex differences are present for all of the phases of drug abuse (initiation, escalation of use, addiction, and relapse following abstinence).

In this  study, we examined the effect of estradiol on the concentration of GABA, taurine, and glutamate in dialysate from striatum.

For the present study, vaginal smears were obtained once a day and stained using an adaptation of the Papanicolaou (PAP) procedure. Images are provided of unstained \"wet\" samples  and the corresponding PAP stained smears illustrating the cellular profile for each stage of the cycle as well as post-ovariectomy. The different cell populations across the cycle were quantified and ratios determined to show trends between the predominant and other cell types in each stage of the estrous cycle.  Both stained and unstained images and cell quantification data provide valuable guidelines for distinguishing the stages of the estrous cycle.", "16162932": "The activity patterns of subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons, which are intimately  related to normal movement and abnormal movement in Parkinson's disease (PD), are sculpted by feedback GABAergic inhibition from the reciprocally connected globus  pallidus (GP). To understand the principles underlying the integration of GABAergic inputs, we used gramicidin-based patch-clamp recording of STN neurons in rat brain slices. Voltage-dependent Na+ (Nav) channels actively truncated synthetic IPSPs and were required for autonomous activity. In contrast, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated and class 3 voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels contributed minimally to the integration of single or low-frequency trains of IPSPs and autonomous activity. Interestingly, IPSPs modified action potentials (APs) in a manner that suggested IPSPs enhanced postsynaptic Nav channel availability. This possibility was confirmed in acutely isolated STN neurons using current-clamp recordings containing IPSPs as voltage-clamp waveforms. Tetrodotoxin-sensitive subthreshold and spike-associated Na+ currents  declined during autonomous spiking but were indeed transiently boosted after IPSPs. A functional consequence of inhibition-dependent augmentation of postsynaptic excitability was that EPSP-AP coupling was dramatically improved when IPSPs preceded EPSPs. Because STN neuronal activity exhibits coherence with  cortical beta-oscillations in PD, we tested how rhythmic sequences of cortical EPSPs were integrated in the absence and presence of feedback inhibition. STN neuronal activity was consistently entrained by EPSPs only in the presence of feedback inhibition. These observations suggest that feedback inhibition from the GP is critical for the emergence of coherent beta-oscillations between the cortex and STN in PD.", "15927221": "The mitogenic agent that disrupts male and female sexual behavior has been isolated from corncob bedding. The disrupting activity resides in an isomeric mixture of linoleic acid derivatives with a tetrahydrofuran ring and two hydroxyl groups (THF-diols) that include 9, (12)-oxy-10, 13-dihydroxtstearic acid and 10,  (13)-oxy-9, 12-dihydroxystearic acid. We examined the effects of exposure of male rats to THF-diols in drinking water on several parameters of male sexual behavior. THF-diols disrupt sexual behavior in male rats by reducing mounting and intromission frequencies. The mount, intromission and ejaculatory latencies are enhanced while the ejaculatory responses are diminished. These findings suggest that the THF-diols modulate hypothalamo-pituitary axis to regulate steroid hormone-dependent male sexual behavior.", "15772239": "Although the basal ganglia of birds and mammals share an enormous number of anatomical, histochemical, and electrophysiological characteristics, studies in songbirds have revealed some important differences. Specifically, a specialized region of songbird striatum (the input structure of the basal ganglia) has an anatomical projection and a physiologically defined cell type that are characteristic of the globus pallidus. At present, it is not clear if these differences result from adaptations specific to songbirds and perhaps a few other avian taxa or are common to all birds. We shed some light on this issue by characterizing the morphology and electrophysiological properties of basal ganglia neurons in an avian species that is only distantly related to songbirds:  the domestic chick. We recorded neurons in chick basal ganglia in a brain slice preparation, using the whole cell technique. We found that chick striatum, like songbird striatum, contains a pallidum-like cell type never reported in mammalian striatum, supporting the hypothesis that this feature is common to all birds. We  also discovered that spiny neurons, the most common cell type in the striatum of  all amniotes, possess a diverse set of physiological properties in chicks that distinguish them from both mammals and songbirds. This study revealed an unexpectedly complex pattern of conservation and divergence in the properties of  neurons recorded in avian striatum.", "11978853": "The song system of oscine birds has frequently been presented as a model system for motor learning in vertebrates. This practice has been bolstered by the growing recognition that one part of the song system that is essential for song learning, area X, is a component of the avian striatum. The mammalian striatum, the input structure of the basal ganglia, has been implicated in a number of motor-related functions, including motor learning, suggesting that song learning  in birds and motor learning in mammals may use similar physiological mechanisms.  We studied the intrinsic physiological properties of area X neurons in brain slices to see how closely they match properties identified in mammalian striatal  neurons and to collect data that are necessary to understand how area X processes information. We found that area X contains all four physiological cell types present in the mammalian striatum and that each is very similar to its mammalian  counterpart. We also found a fifth cell type in area X that has not been reported in mammalian striatum; instead, this cell type resembles neurons that have been recorded in the mammalian globus pallidus. This pallidum-like cell type morphologically resembles the projection neurons of area X. We suggest that area  X contains a pathway equivalent to the \"direct\" striatopallidothalamic pathway through the mammalian basal ganglia, with the striatal and pallidal components intermingled in one nucleus.", "11836146": "Housing adult rats on ground corncob bedding impedes male and female mating behavior and causes acyclicity in females. The suppressive effects on ovarian cyclicity are mimicked by a mitogenic agent purified from the ground corncob bedding material (corn mitogen; CM), which stimulates the proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF-7 cells) and ER-negative (MDA-MD-231 cells)  breast cancer cells. Purified CM does not compete for [(3)H]estradiol binding to  ER or nuclear type II sites, and its effects on MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation are not blocked by the antiestrogen ICI-182,780. These results suggest that the active component is unlikely to be a phytoestrogen, bioflavonoid, mycotoxin, or other known endocrine-disrupting agent that modifies  cell growth via ER or type II [(3)H]estradiol binding sites. CM also stimulates the proliferation of PC-3 human prostatic cancer cells in vitro, and the growth rate of PC-3 cell xenografts is accelerated in nude male mice housed on ground corncob as opposed to pure cellulose bedding. Consequently, this endocrine-disrupting agent in ground corncob bedding may influence behavioral and physiologic reproductive response profiles and malignant cell proliferation in experimental animals. Fresh corn (kernels and cob) or corn tortillas also contain CM, indicating that human exposure is likely; consequently, CM and/or related mitogens in corn products may influence human health and development.", "11067993": "The forebrains of mammals and birds appear quite different in their gross morphology, making it difficult to identify homologies between them and to assess how far they have diverged in organization. Nevertheless one set of forebrain structures, the basal ganglia, has been successfully compared in mammals and birds. Anatomical, histochemical, and molecular data have identified the avian homologues of the mammalian basal ganglia and indicate that they are very similar in organization, suggesting that they perform similar functions in the two classes. However, the physiological properties of the avian basal ganglia have not been studied, and these properties are critical for inferring functional similarity. We have used a zebra finch brain slice preparation to characterize the intrinsic physiological properties of neurons in the avian basal ganglia, particularly in the input structure of the basal ganglia, the striatum. We found  that avian striatum contains a cell type that closely resembles the medium spiny  neuron, the principal cell type of mammalian striatum. Avian striatum also contains a rare cell type that is very similar to an interneuron class found in mammalian striatum, the low-threshold spike cell. On the other hand, we found an  aspiny, fast-firing cell type in avian striatum that is distinct from all known classes of mammalian striatal neuron. These neurons usually fired spontaneously at 10 Hz or more and were capable of sustained firing at very high rates when injected with depolarizing current. The existence of this cell type represents an important difference between avian striatum and mammalian dorsal striatum. Our data support the general idea that the organization and functional properties of  the basal ganglia have been largely conserved in mammals and birds, but they imply that avian striatum is not identical to mammalian dorsal striatum.", "11067966": "We have studied the postnatal development of the physiological characteristics of nucleus accumbens (nAcb) neurons in slices from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P49 rats  using the whole cell patch-clamp technique. The majority of neurons (102/108) were physiologically identified as medium spiny (MS) projection neurons, and only these were subjected to detailed analysis. The remaining neurons displayed characteristics suggesting that they were not MS neurons. Around the time of birth and during the first postnatal weeks, the membrane and firing characteristics of MS neurons were quite different from those observed later. These characteristics changed rapidly during the first 3 postnatal weeks, at which point they began to resemble those found in adults. Both whole cell membrane resistance and membrane time constant decreased more than fourfold during the period studied. The resting membrane potential (RMP) also changed significantly from an average of -50 mV around birth to less than -80 mV by the end of the third postnatal week. During the first postnatal week, the current-voltage relationship of all encountered MS neurons was linear over a wide range of membrane potentials above and below RMP. Through the second postnatal week, the proportion of neurons displaying inward rectification in the hyperpolarized range increased steadily and after P15, all recorded MS neurons displayed significant inward rectification. At all ages, inward rectification was blocked by extracellular cesium and tetra-ethyl ammonium and was not changed by 4-aminopyridine; this shows that inward rectification was mediated by the same currents in young and mature MS neurons. MS neurons fired single and repetitive Na(+)/K(+) action potentials as early as P1. Spike threshold and amplitude remained constant throughout development in contrast to spike duration, which decreased significantly over the same period. Depolarizing current pulses from rest showed that immature MS neurons fired action potentials more easily than their older counterparts. Taken together, the results from the present study suggest that young and adult nAcb MS neurons integrate excitatory synaptic inputs differently because of differences in their membrane and firing properties. These findings provide important insights into signal processing within nAcb during this critical period of development.", "10845063": "The striatum and its ventral extension, the nucleus accumbens, are involved in behaviors as diverse as motor planning, drug seeking, and learning. Invariably, these striatally mediated behaviors depend on intact dopaminergic innervation. However, the mechanisms by which dopamine modulates neuronal function in the striatum and nucleus accumbens have been difficult to elucidate. Recent electrophysiological studies have revealed that dopamine alters both voltage-dependent conductances and synaptic transmission, resulting in state-dependent modulation of target cells. These studies make clear predictions  about how dopamine, particularly via D1 receptor activation, should alter the responsiveness of striatal neurons to extrinsic excitatory synaptic activity.", "10494997": "There are estrous cycle-dependent differences in amphetamine-stimulated behaviors and striatal dopamine (DA) release; intact female rats exhibit a greater behavioral response to amphetamine on estrus than on other days of the cycle. Following ovariectomy amphetamine-induced behavior is attenuated, as is the striatal DA response to amphetamine in vitro. Repeated estrogen treatment in ovariectomized rats reinstates both of these responses to a level comparable to estrous females. In addition, 30 min after a single treatment with a physiological dose of estrogen there is enhanced amphetamine-induced behavior and increased amphetamine-induced striatal DA detected during microdialysis. This experiment was conducted to determine whether the acute effect of estradiol and the effect of repeated exposure to estrogen are functionally related. We report here that prior treatment with estrogen (three daily treatments of 5 microg estradiol benzoate) results in a significant enhancement of the effect of acute estrogen (5 microg estradiol benzoate) or progesterone (500 microg) on amphetamine-induced striatal DA release and stereotyped behaviors. Both the peak  response and the duration of the response are greater in estrogen-primed animals  treated with estrogen or progesterone 30 min prior to amphetamine, than in all other groups. Either prior treatment with estrogen (last dose 24 h before) or a single acute injection of estrogen result in an enhanced peak response to amphetamine, with no effect on the duration of amphetamine-induced striatal DA release. Treatment with progesterone in animals not primed with estrogen was not  different from treatment with oil vehicle. These results demonstrate that there are both acute and long-term effects of estrogen on the striatum that underlie the dynamic changes in stimulated DA release and amphetamine-induced behaviors during the reproductive cycle.", "8551343": "Until recently, steroid hormones were believed to act only on cells containing intracellular receptors. However, recent evidence suggests that steroids have specific and rapid effects at the cellular membrane. Using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques, 17 beta-estradiol was found to reduce Ba2+ entry reversibly via Ca2+  channels in acutely dissociated and cultured neostriatal neurons. The effects were sex-specific, i.e., the reduction of Ba2+ currents was greater in neurons taken from female rats. 17 beta-Estradiol primarily targeted L-type currents, and their inhibition was detected reliably within seconds of administration. The maximum reduction by 17 beta-estradiol occurred at picomolar concentrations. 17 beta-Estradiol conjugated to bovine serum albumin also reduced Ba2+ currents, suggesting that the effect occurs at the membrane surface. Dialysis with GTP gamma S prevented reversal of the modulation, suggesting that 17 beta-estradiol acts via G-protein activation. 17 alpha-Estradiol also reduced Ba2+ currents but  was significantly less effective than 17 beta-estradiol. Estriol and 4-hydroxyestradiol were found to reduce Ba2+ currents with similar efficacy to 17 beta-estradiol, whereas estrone and 2-methoxyestriol were less effective. Tamoxifen also reduced Ba2+ currents but did not occlude the effect of 17 beta-estradiol. These results suggest that at physiological concentrations, 17 beta-estradiol can have immediate actions on neostriatal neurons via nongenomic signaling pathways.", "8446922": "The morphology and electrophysiological properties of neurons in the nucleus accumbens were studied using intracellular recording techniques in rat brain slices maintained in vitro. Neurons were subdivided according to their location in the shell or core region of the nucleus accumbens. Most of the cells in both regions had small to medium-sized (15.8 +/- 2.8 microns) somata with densely spinous dendrites, somewhat similar to the striatal medium spiny neuron. However, minor morphological differences between neurons from accumbens core and shell regions were found, such as fewer primary dendrites in shell neurons than in the  core (3.8 +/- 0.8 vs. 4.4 +/- 1.0) and the spatial organization of their dendritic trees. In general, the passive membrane properties of neurons in each region were similar. However, shell neurons appeared to be less excitable in nature, as suggested by (1) a faster time constant, (2) the absence of TTX-insensitive events resembling low-threshold spikes, and (3) the lower probability of evoking spikes in shell neurons by stimulation of amygdaloid or cortical afferents in comparison to the responses of core neurons to cortical afferent stimulation. In most nucleus accumbens neurons the action potentials evoked by membrane depolarization were preceded by a slow Ca(2+)-dependent depolarization and showed firing-frequency adaptation. Following TTX administration, all-or-none spike-like events resembling high-threshold calcium spikes were observed in both regions. In summary, except for minor differences, most of the properties of core and shell neurons are similar, supporting their characterization as subdivisions of a single structure. Therefore, differences in the functional properties of these neuronal populations are likely to be due to their distinct connectivity patterns.", "2309159": "The nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system is sexually dimorphic. In female but not male rats, striatal DA activity is modulated by gonadal steroid hormones. Ovariectomy (OVX) decreases striatal DA release and turnover. Estrogen replacement restores the response to that of the intact female in estrus. In contrast, castration (CAST) of male rats has no effect on the stimulated release  of DA from striatal tissue. This report addresses the question: Does estrogen act directly on the striatum to induce changes in DA release? Physiological concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and other steroids or a nonsteroidal estrogen analog were applied directly to striatal tissue maintained in an in vitro superfusion system. The effect of hormonal treatments on the responsiveness of striatal DA terminals to stimulation was examined in tissue from OVX females and  intact and CAST male rats. The results are summarized as follows: (1) Infusion of 17 beta-estradiol (p less than 0.01) and diethylstilbestrol (p less than 0.05) increased amphetamine (AMPH)-stimulated striatal DA release from striatal tissue  of OVX female rats compared with the effect of cholesterol. 17 alpha-Estradiol also tended to potentiate the striatal DA response to AMPH, but this result was not statistically significant (p less than 0.062). 17 beta-Estradiol had no effect on AMPH-stimulated DA release from striatal tissue of intact male rats. (2) The KCl-stimulated release of DA from striatal tissue of OVX rats exposed in  vitro to 100 pg/ml 17 beta-estradiol (a physiological dose) was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) than the response after exposure to vehicle.(ABSTRACT  TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "24431428": "Making predictions about the rewards associated with environmental stimuli and updating those predictions through feedback is an essential aspect of adaptive behavior. Theorists have argued that dopamine encodes a reward prediction error (RPE) signal that is used in such a reinforcement learning process. Recent work with fMRI has demonstrated that the BOLD signal in dopaminergic target areas meets both necessary and sufficient conditions of an axiomatic model of the RPE hypothesis. However, there has been no direct evidence that dopamine release itself also meets necessary and sufficient criteria for encoding an RPE signal. Further, the fact that dopamine neurons have low tonic firing rates that yield a  limited dynamic range for encoding negative RPEs has led to significant debate about whether positive and negative prediction errors are encoded on a similar scale. To address both of these issues, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure reward-evoked dopamine release at carbon fiber electrodes chronically implanted in the nucleus accumbens core of rats trained on a probabilistic decision-making task. We demonstrate that dopamine concentrations transmit a bidirectional RPE signal with symmetrical encoding of positive and negative RPEs. Our findings strengthen the case that changes in dopamine concentration alone are sufficient to encode the full range of RPEs necessary for reinforcement learning.", "23708143": "Situations in which rewards are unexpectedly obtained or withheld represent opportunities for new learning. Often, this learning includes identifying cues that predict reward availability. Unexpected rewards strongly activate midbrain dopamine neurons. This phasic signal is proposed to support learning about antecedent cues by signaling discrepancies between actual and expected outcomes,  termed a reward prediction error. However, it is unknown whether dopamine neuron  prediction error signaling and cue-reward learning are causally linked. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated dopamine neuron activity in rats in two behavioral procedures, associative blocking and extinction, that illustrate the essential function of prediction errors in learning. We observed that optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons concurrent with reward delivery, mimicking a prediction error, was sufficient to cause long-lasting increases in cue-elicited  reward-seeking behavior. Our findings establish a causal role for temporally precise dopamine neuron signaling in cue-reward learning, bridging a critical gap between experimental evidence and influential theoretical frameworks.", "23374641": "BACKGROUND: Recent theories addressing mesolimbic dopamine's role in reward processing emphasize two apparently distinct functions, one in reinforcement learning (i.e., prediction error) and another in incentive motivation (i.e., the  invigoration of reward seeking elicited by reward-paired cues). Here, we evaluate the latter. METHODS: Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, we monitored, in real time, dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core of rats (n = 9) during a Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer task in which the effects of a reward-predictive cue on an independently trained instrumental action were assessed. Voltammetric data were parsed into slow and phasic components to determine whether these forms of dopamine signaling were differentially related to task performance. RESULTS: We found that a reward-paired cue, which increased reward-seeking actions, induced an increase in phasic mesolimbic dopamine release and produced slower elevations in extracellular dopamine. Interestingly, phasic dopamine release was temporally related to and positively correlated with lever-press activity generally, while slow dopamine changes were not significantly related to such activity. Importantly, the propensity of the reward-paired cue to increase lever pressing was predicted by the amplitude of phasic dopamine release events,  indicating a possible mechanism through which cues initiate reward-seeking actions. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that those phasic mesolimbic dopamine release events thought to signal reward prediction error may also be related to the incentive motivational impact of reward-paired cues on reward-seeking actions.", "23235832": "Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons in the brain's reward circuit have  a crucial role in mediating stress responses, including determining susceptibility versus resilience to social-stress-induced behavioural abnormalities. VTA dopamine neurons show two in vivo patterns of firing: low frequency tonic firing and high frequency phasic firing. Phasic firing of the neurons, which is well known to encode reward signals, is upregulated by repeated social-defeat stress, a highly validated mouse model of depression. Surprisingly, this pathophysiological effect is seen in susceptible mice only, with no apparent change in firing rate in resilient individuals. However, direct evidence--in real time--linking dopamine neuron phasic firing in promoting the susceptible (depression-like) phenotype is lacking. Here we took advantage of the temporal precision and cell-type and projection-pathway specificity of optogenetics to show that enhanced phasic firing of these neurons mediates susceptibility to social-defeat stress in freely behaving mice. We show that optogenetic induction  of phasic, but not tonic, firing in VTA dopamine neurons of mice undergoing a subthreshold social-defeat paradigm rapidly induced a susceptible phenotype as measured by social avoidance and decreased sucrose preference. Optogenetic phasic stimulation of these neurons also quickly induced a susceptible phenotype in previously resilient mice that had been subjected to repeated social-defeat stress. Furthermore, we show differences in projection-pathway specificity in promoting stress susceptibility: phasic activation of VTA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), induced susceptibility to social-defeat stress. Conversely, optogenetic inhibition of the VTA-NAc projection induced resilience, whereas inhibition of the VTA-mPFC projection promoted susceptibility. Overall, these studies reveal novel firing-pattern- and neural-circuit-specific mechanisms of depression.", "23235822": "Major depression is characterized by diverse debilitating symptoms that include hopelessness and anhedonia. Dopamine neurons involved in reward and motivation are among many neural populations that have been hypothesized to be relevant, and certain antidepressant treatments, including medications and brain stimulation therapies, can influence the complex dopamine system. Until now it has not been possible to test this hypothesis directly, even in animal models, as existing therapeutic interventions are unable to specifically target dopamine neurons. Here we investigated directly the causal contributions of defined dopamine neurons to multidimensional depression-like phenotypes induced by chronic mild stress, by integrating behavioural, pharmacological, optogenetic and electrophysiological methods in freely moving rodents. We found that bidirectional control (inhibition or excitation) of specified midbrain dopamine neurons immediately and bidirectionally modulates (induces or relieves) multiple  independent depression symptoms caused by chronic stress. By probing the circuit  implementation of these effects, we observed that optogenetic recruitment of these dopamine neurons potently alters the neural encoding of depression-related  behaviours in the downstream nucleus accumbens of freely moving rodents, suggesting that processes affecting depression symptoms may involve alterations in the neural encoding of action in limbic circuitry.", "22196983": "The manifestation of complex neuropsychiatric disorders, such as drug and alcohol addiction, is thought to result from progressive maladaptive alterations in neural circuit function. Clearly, repeated drug exposure alters a distributed network of neural circuit elements. However, a more precise understanding of addiction has been hampered by an inability to control and, consequently, identify specific circuit components that underlie addictive behaviors. The development of optogenetic strategies for selectively modulating the activity of  genetically defined neuronal populations has provided a means for determining the relationship between circuit function and behavior with a level of precision that has been previously unobtainable. Here, we briefly review the main optogenetic studies that have contributed to elucidate neural circuit connectivity within the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens, two brain nuclei that are essential for the manifestation of addiction-related behaviors. Additional targeted manipulation of genetically defined neural populations in these brain regions, as well as afferent and efferent structures, promises to delineate the cellular mechanisms and circuit components required for the transition from natural goal-directed behavior to compulsive reward seeking despite negative consequences.", "22122410": "Phasic changes in dopamine activity play a critical role in learning and goal-directed behavior. Unpredicted reward and reward-predictive cues evoke phasic increases in the firing rate of the majority of midbrain dopamine neurons--results that predict uniformly broadcast increases in dopamine concentration throughout the striatum. However, measurement of dopamine concentration changes during reward has cast doubt on this prediction. We systematically measured phasic changes in dopamine in four striatal subregions [nucleus accumbens shell and core (Core), dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral striatum] in response to stimuli known to activate a majority of dopamine neurons. We used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in awake and behaving rats, which measures changes in dopamine on a similar timescale to the electrophysiological recordings that established a relationship between phasic dopamine activity and reward. Unlike the responses of midbrain dopamine neurons, unpredicted food reward and reward-predictive cues evoked a phasic increase in dopamine that was subregion specific. In rats with limited experience, unpredicted food reward evoked an increase exclusively in the Core. In rats trained on a discriminative stimulus paradigm, both unpredicted reward and reward-predictive cues evoked robust phasic dopamine in the Core and DMS. Thus, phasic dopamine release in select target structures is dynamic and dependent on context and experience. Because the four subregions assayed receive different inputs and have differential projection targets, the regional selectivity of phasic changes in dopamine has important implications for information flow through the striatum and plasticity that underlies learning and goal-directed behavior.", "21795535": "Phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons is associated with reward-predicting cues and supports learning during behavioral adaptation. While noncontingent activation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental are (VTA) is sufficient for passive behavioral conditioning, it remains unknown whether the phasic dopaminergic signal is truly reinforcing. In this study, we first targeted the expression of channelrhodopsin-2 to dopaminergic neurons of the VTA and optimized optogenetically evoked dopamine transients. Second, we showed that phasic activation of dopaminergic neurons in freely moving mice causally enhances positive reinforcing actions in a food-seeking operant task. Interestingly, such  effect was not found in the absence of food reward. We further found that phasic  activation of dopaminergic neurons is sufficient to reactivate previously extinguished food-seeking behavior in the absence of external cues. This was also confirmed using a single-session reversal paradigm. Collectively, these data suggest that activation of dopaminergic neurons facilitates the development of positive reinforcement during reward-seeking and behavioral flexibility.", "18753384": "Preferential enhancement of dopamine transmission within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell is a fundamental aspect of the neural regulation of cocaine reward. Despite its importance, the nature of this effect is poorly understood. Here, we  used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to examine specific transmission processes underlying cocaine-evoked increases in dopamine transmission within the NAc core  and shell. Initially, we examined altered terminal dopamine concentrations after  global autoreceptor blockade. This was the first examination of autoreceptor regulation of naturally occurring phasic dopamine transmission and provided a novel characterization of specific components of dopamine neurotransmission. Comparison of increased dopamine signaling evoked by autoreceptor blockade and cocaine administration allowed robust resolution between increased frequency, concentration, and duration of phasic dopamine release events after cocaine delivery. Cocaine increased dopamine transmission by slowed uptake and increased  concentration of dopamine released in the core and shell. However, an additional  increase in the number phasic release events occurred only within the NAc shell,  and this increase was eliminated by inactivation of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. This represents the first evidence that cocaine directly increases the frequency of dopamine release events and reveals that this is responsible for preferentially increased dopamine transmission within the NAc shell after cocaine administration. Additionally, cocaine administration resulted in a synergistic increase in dopamine concentration, and subregion differences were abolished when cocaine was administered in the absence of autoregulation. Together, these results demonstrate that cocaine administration results in a temporally and regionally specific increase in phasic dopamine release that is significantly regulated by dopamine autoreceptors.", "18689678": "Dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is an important neurotransmitter for reward-seeking behaviors such as intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), although its precise role remains unclear. Here, dynamic fluctuations in extracellular dopamine were measured during ICSS in the rat NAc shell with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at carbon-fiber microelectrodes. Rats were trained to press a lever to deliver electrical stimulation to the substantia nigra (SNc)/ventral tegmental area (VTA) after the random onset of a cue that predicted reward availability. Latency to respond after cue onset significantly declined across trials, indicative of learning. Dopamine release was evoked by the stimulation but also developed across trials in a time-locked fashion to the cue. Once established, the cue-evoked dopamine transients continued to grow in amplitude, although they  were variable from trial to trial. The emergence of cue-evoked dopamine correlated with a decline in electrically evoked dopamine release. Extinction of  ICSS resulted in a significant decline in goal-directed behavior coupled to a significant decrease in cue-evoked phasic dopamine across trials. Subsequent reinstatement of ICSS was correlated with a return to preextinction transient amplitudes in response to the cue and reestablishment of ICSS behavior. The results show the dynamic nature of chemical signaling in the NAc during ICSS and  provide new insight into the role of NAc dopamine in reward-related behaviors.", "17603481": "The ability to predict favorable outcomes using environmental cues is an essential part of learned behavior. Dopamine neurons in the midbrain encode such  stimulus-reward relationships in a manner consistent with contemporary learning models, but it is unclear how encoding this translates into actual dopamine release in target regions. Here, we sampled dopamine levels in the rat nucleus accumbens on a rapid (100 ms) timescale using electrochemical technology during a classical conditioning procedure. Early in conditioning, transient dopamine-release events signaled a primary reward, but not predictive cues. After repeated cue-reward pairings, dopamine signals shifted in time to predictive cue  onset and were no longer observed at reward delivery. In the absence of stimulus-reward conditioning, there was no shift in the dopamine signal. Consistent with proposed roles in reward prediction and incentive salience, these results indicate that rapid dopamine release provides a reward signal that is dynamically modified by associative learning.", "15996553": "The midbrain dopamine neurons are hypothesized to provide a physiological correlate of the reward prediction error signal required by current models of reinforcement learning. We examined the activity of single dopamine neurons during a task in which subjects learned by trial and error when to make an eye movement for a juice reward. We found that these neurons encoded the difference between the current reward and a weighted average of previous rewards, a reward prediction error, but only for outcomes that were better than expected. Thus, the firing rate of midbrain dopamine neurons is quantitatively predicted by theoretical descriptions of the reward prediction error signal used in reinforcement learning models for circumstances in which this signal has a positive value. We also found that the dopamine system continued to compute the reward prediction error even when the behavioral policy of the animal was only weakly influenced by this computation.", "15944133": "While Pavlovian and operant conditioning influence drug-seeking behavior, the role of rapid dopamine signaling in modulating these processes is unknown. During self-administration of cocaine, two dopaminergic signals, measured with 100 ms resolution, occurred immediately before and after the lever press (termed pre- and post-response dopamine transients). Extinction of self-administration revealed that these two signals were functionally distinct. Pre-response transients, which could reflect the motivation to obtain the drug, did not decline during extinction. Remarkably, post-response dopamine transients attenuated as extinction progressed, suggesting that they encode the learned association between environmental cues and cocaine. A third type of dopamine transient, not time locked to overt stimuli, decreased in frequency during extinction and correlated with calculated cocaine concentrations. These results show that dopamine release transients involved in different aspects of cocaine self-administration are highly plastic--differentially governed by motivation, learned associations linked with environmental stimuli, and the pharmacological actions of cocaine.", "15152198": "Author information:  (1)Behavioral Neuroscience Branch, Intramural Research Program, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA. rwise@intra.nida.nih.gov", "14960596": "The dopamine projection to the nucleus accumbens has been implicated in behaviors directed toward the acquisition and consumption of natural rewards. The neurochemical studies that established this link made time-averaged measurements  over minutes, and so the precise temporal relationship between dopamine changes and these behaviors is not known. To resolve this, we sampled dopamine every 100  msec using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at carbon-fiber microelectrodes in the nucleus accumbens of rats trained to press a lever for sucrose. Cues that signal  the opportunity to respond for sucrose evoked dopamine release (67 +/- 20 nm) with short latency (0.2 +/- 0.1 sec onset). When the same cues were presented to  rats naive to the cue-sucrose pairing, similar dopamine signals were not observed. Thus, cue-evoked increases in dopamine in trained rats reflected a learned association between the cues and sucrose availability. Lever presses for  sucrose occurred at the peak of the dopamine surges. After lever presses, and while sucrose was delivered and consumed, no further increases in dopamine were detected. Rather, dopamine returned to baseline levels. Together, the results strongly implicate subsecond dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens as a real-time modulator of food-seeking behavior.", "12897785": "The mesolimbic dopamine system is centrally involved in reward and goal-directed  behavior, and it has been implicated in multiple psychiatric disorders. Understanding the mechanism by which dopamine participates in these activities requires comprehension of the dynamics of dopamine release. Here we report dissociable regulation of dopamine neuron discharge by two separate afferent systems in rats; inhibition of pallidal afferents selectively increased the population activity of dopamine neurons, whereas activation of pedunculopontine inputs increased burst firing. Only the increase in population activity increased ventral striatal dopamine efflux. After blockade of dopamine reuptake, however, enhanced bursting increased dopamine efflux three times more than did enhanced population activity. These results provide insight into multiple regulatory systems that modulate dopamine system function: burst firing induces massive synaptic dopamine release, which is rapidly removed by reuptake before escaping the synaptic cleft, whereas increased population activity modulates tonic extrasynaptic dopamine levels that are less influenced by reuptake.", "12687000": "The dopamine-containing projection from the ventral tegmental area of the midbrain to the nucleus accumbens is critically involved in mediating the reinforcing properties of cocaine. Although neurons in this area respond to rewards on a subsecond timescale, neurochemical studies have only addressed the role of dopamine in drug addiction by examining changes in the tonic (minute-to-minute) levels of extracellular dopamine. To investigate the role of phasic (subsecond) dopamine signalling, we measured dopamine every 100 ms in the  nucleus accumbens using electrochemical technology. Rapid changes in extracellular dopamine concentration were observed at key aspects of drug-taking  behaviour in rats. Before lever presses for cocaine, there was an increase in dopamine that coincided with the initiation of drug-seeking behaviours. Notably,  these behaviours could be reproduced by electrically evoking dopamine release on  this timescale. After lever presses, there were further increases in dopamine concentration at the concurrent presentation of cocaine-related cues. These cues  alone also elicited similar, rapid dopamine signalling, but only in animals where they had previously been paired to cocaine delivery. These findings reveal an unprecedented role for dopamine in the regulation of drug taking in real time.", "12204216": "There is a large body of data on the firing properties of dopamine cells in anaesthetised rats or rat brain slices. However, the extent to which these data relate to more natural conditions is uncertain, as there is little quantitative information available on the firing properties of these cells in freely moving rats. We examined this by recording from the midbrain dopamine cell fields using  chronically implanted microwire electrodes. (1) In most cases, slowly firing cells with broad action potentials were profoundly inhibited by the dopamine agonist apomorphine, consistent with previously accepted criteria. However, a small group of cells was found that were difficult to classify because of ambiguous combinations of properties. (2) Presumed dopamine cells could be divided into low and high bursting (>40% of their spikes in bursts) groups, with  the majority having low bursting rates. The distribution of burst incidence was similar to that previously reported with chloral hydrate anaesthesia, but the average intraburst frequency was higher in the conscious animal at rest and was higher again in bursts triggered by salient stimuli. (3) There was no evidence for spike frequency adaptation within bursts on average, consistent with the hypothesis that afterhyperpolarisation currents may be disabled during behaviourally induced bursting. (4) Presumed dopamine cells responded to reward-related stimuli with increased bursting rates and significantly higher intraburst frequencies compared to bursts emitted outside task context, indicating that modulation of afferent activity might not only trigger bursting,  but may also regulate burst intensity. (5) In addition to the irregular single spike and bursting modes we found that extremely regular (clock-like) firing, previously only described for dopamine cells in reduced preparations, can also be expressed in the freely moving animal. (6) Cross-correlation analysis of activity recorded from simultaneously recorded neurones revealed coordinated activity in a quarter of dopamine cell pairs consistent with at least \"functional\" connectivity. On the other hand, most dopamine cell pairs showed no correlation,  leaving open the possibility of functional sub-groupings within the dopamine cell fields. Taken together, the data suggest that the basic firing modes described for dopamine cells in reduced or anaesthetised preparations do reflect natural patterns of activity for these neurones, but also that the details of this activity are dependent upon modulation of afferent inputs by behavioural stimuli.", "11002907": "All drugs of abuse have been shown to act either directly or indirectly by increasing dopamine neurotransmission within the limbic system. Thus, alcohol has been shown to increase dopamine transmission primarily by activating dopamine cell spike activity, whereas psychostimulants increase dopamine transmission by inhibiting the removal of dopamine from the synaptic space after its release. The spike-dependent release of dopamine that is modulated by drugs of abuse to lead to their rewarding actions has been termed the phasic dopamine response. In contrast, with repeated drug administration, dopamine will also accumulate in the extracellular space of the nucleus accumbens in concentrations too low to stimulate postsynaptic receptors, but of sufficient magnitude to activate dopamine release-inhibiting autoreceptors. In addition, the level of extracellular dopamine is proposed to be under the regulatory influence of cortico-accumbens afferents. This steady-state level of extrasynaptic dopamine has been termed the tonic dopamine response. In this paper it is proposed that several of the aspects of drug addiction, withdrawal and craving associated with  the continued use of these drugs can be explained on the basis of their effects on tonic versus phasic dopamine system function. Thus, the increase in tonic dopamine levels that occurs with repeated drug administration would serve to oppose phasic dopamine release via stimulation of dopamine terminal autoreceptors, causing the subject to increase drug administration to restore the phasic response. Moreover, after withdrawal from the drugs, exposure to priming doses of drug or to drug-related stimuli are proposed to increase tonic dopamine  levels, again triggering drug-seeking behavior in order to restore balance between the tonic and phasic dopamine systems. Therefore, one consequence of continued drug use is that these parameters of dopamine system function that normally serve to keep the system stable will enter into a new steady-state homeostasis, from which the system is particularly susceptible to destabilizing influences that may precipitate relapse.", "9658025": "The effects of lesions, receptor blocking, electrical self-stimulation, and drugs of abuse suggest that midbrain dopamine systems are involved in processing reward information and learning approach behavior. Most dopamine neurons show phasic activations after primary liquid and food rewards and conditioned, reward-predicting visual and auditory stimuli. They show biphasic, activation-depression responses after stimuli that resemble reward-predicting stimuli or are novel or particularly salient. However, only few phasic activations follow aversive stimuli. Thus dopamine neurons label environmental stimuli with appetitive value, predict and detect rewards and signal alerting and motivating events. By failing to discriminate between different rewards, dopamine neurons appear to emit an alerting message about the surprising presence or absence of rewards. All responses to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli depend on event predictability. Dopamine neurons are activated by rewarding events that  are better than predicted, remain uninfluenced by events that are as good as predicted, and are depressed by events that are worse than predicted. By signaling rewards according to a prediction error, dopamine responses have the formal characteristics of a teaching signal postulated by reinforcement learning  theories. Dopamine responses transfer during learning from primary rewards to reward-predicting stimuli. This may contribute to neuronal mechanisms underlying  the retrograde action of rewards, one of the main puzzles in reinforcement learning. The impulse response releases a short pulse of dopamine onto many dendrites, thus broadcasting a rather global reinforcement signal to postsynaptic neurons. This signal may improve approach behavior by providing advance reward information before the behavior occurs, and may contribute to learning by modifying synaptic transmission. The dopamine reward signal is supplemented by activity in neurons in striatum, frontal cortex, and amygdala, which process specific reward information but do not emit a global reward prediction error signal. A cooperation between the different reward signals may assure the use of  specific rewards for selectively reinforcing behaviors. Among the other projection systems, noradrenaline neurons predominantly serve attentional mechanisms and nucleus basalis neurons code rewards heterogeneously. Cerebellar climbing fibers signal errors in motor performance or errors in the prediction of aversive events to cerebellar Purkinje cells. Most deficits following dopamine-depleting lesions are not easily explained by a defective reward signal  but may reflect the absence of a general enabling function of tonic levels of extracellular dopamine. Thus dopamine systems may have two functions, the phasic  transmission of reward information and the tonic enabling of postsynaptic neurons.", "9054347": "The capacity to predict future events permits a creature to detect, model, and manipulate the causal structure of its interactions with its environment. Behavioral experiments suggest that learning is driven by changes in the expectations about future salient events such as rewards and punishments. Physiological work has recently complemented these studies by identifying dopaminergic neurons in the primate whose fluctuating output apparently signals changes or errors in the predictions of future salient and rewarding events. Taken together, these findings can be understood through quantitative theories of adaptive optimizing control.", "6816390": "The organization of projection neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and in adjacent parts of the raphe nuclei medial to it (the central and rostral linear, and interfascicular nuclei), the mammillary body (the supramammillary region and the tuberomammillary nucleus), and the substantia nigra have been examined in the rat with Kuypers' retrograde double labeling method, and with a combined retrograde labeling (with true blue)-immunohistochemical method for the  demonstration of dopaminergic neurons. First, the distribution, within the VTA and adjacent regions, of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cells that project to  terminal fields in the telencephalon (nucleus accumbens, lateral septum, pre- and supragenual fields of the anterior limbic cortex, amygdala, dorsal hippocampus, and entorhinal area), in the diencephalon (lateral habenula), and in the brainstem (locus coeruleus, and parabrachial nucleus) was determined. Then, 15 different combinations of injections of the tracers bisbenzimide and true blue into different terminal fields were made to determine whether individual cells in the region of the VTA send collaterals to more than one site. Taken together, the results indicate that essentially separate groups of cells in the VTA and adjacent regions of the raphe project to each terminal field. In addition, each group can be further divided into dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic components, although the proportion of dopaminergic cells in each group can vary from over 80% (e.g., to the nucleus accumbens) to less than 1% (to the lateral habenula and to the locus coeruleus). In addition, it was found that the supramammillary region, which contains a dense extension of the A10 cell group in its medial part, and the tuberomammillary nucleus, project to, or through, most of the regions injected with retrograde tracers. Virtually all of the projections from the VTA and adjacent regions are partially crossed, the percentage of cells on the uninjected side ranging from over 40% (e.g., for locus coeruleus injections)  to only about 2% (e.g., for amygdalar injections). Most of the groups of projection neurons in the region of the VTA are considerably intermixed with the  exception of those that project to the lateral septum, to the lateral habenula, and to the hippocampal formation, which are concentrated in ventral and medial parts of the VTA, and in the raphe nuclei medial to the VTA. It was concluded that in the ventral part of the midbrain, essentially separate groups of aminergic and non-aminergic neurons in both the reticular formation (VTA) and in  the adjacent nuclei of the raphe project bilaterally to a variety of similar terminal fields in the telencephalon, diencephalon, and brainstem. Further work at the single cell level is needed to determine whether these cell groups are differentially innervated by known inputs to the VTA and adjacent regions, most of which appear to descend through the medial forebrain bundle from sites in the  limbic system and hypothalamus.", "6150071": "In addition to firing in a single spiking mode, dopamine (DA) cells have been observed to fire in a bursting pattern with consecutive spikes in a burst displaying progressively decreasing amplitude and increasing duration. In vivo intracellular recording demonstrated the bursts to typically ride on a depolarizing wave (5 to 15 mV amplitude). Although the burst-firing frequency of  DA cells showed little correlation with the base line firing rate, increases in firing rate were usually associated with an increase in burst firing. Increases in burst firing could also be elicited by intracellular calcium injection and could be prevented by intracellular injection of EGTA, suggesting a calcium involvement in bursting. Blockade of potassium conductances with extracellular iontophoresis of barium or intracellular injection of tetraethylammonium bromide  could also trigger an increased degree of burst firing in DA cells. These data suggest that the increased calcium influx accompanying an increased firing rate triggers burst firing, possibly by inactivating a potassium conductance. A switch from a single spiking mode to a burst-firing mode may be important in modulating  striatal DA release, as shown for burst firing in other preparations.", "2282449": "Advances in measurement techniques have enabled the extracellular concentration of dopamine to be monitored inside striatal structures during transient electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle. The observed concentration changes can be accounted for by a mathematical model as a function of the frequency employed and the stimulus duration. Overflow curves can be described by 3 kinetic parameters: the concentration of dopamine released per stimulus pulse,  and the Km and Vmax of uptake. In terms of this model, the kinetics of overflow during stimulation is found to be identical in the nucleus accumbens and caudate  nucleus with the exception that the Vmax for uptake is lower in the former region. Maximal uptake is also found to be lower in animals with partial lesions  of dopamine neurons. Measured concentrations vary with stimulation frequency from 10 to 60 Hz in a manner that can be predicted by the model. Competitive uptake inhibitors have their primary effect on overflow in the limit of low stimulus frequencies. In contrast, D2 antagonists, which increase the concentration of dopamine released per stimulus pulse, have a moderate effect in low and high frequency ranges, but cause a significant maximal increase in extracellular dopamine concentrations at a mid-range frequency. Both calculated response and experimental findings indicate that in the caudate nucleus, the upper frequency for observable uptake inhibition and the characteristic maximum frequency for the receptor-mediated response occur at higher values than in the nucleus accumbens.  The model appears to be useful for predicting dopamine extracellular concentrations over a wide range of conditions, and its predictions may be valid  when extended to more physiological situations.", "1676137": "A novel mechanism for regulating dopamine activity in subcortical sites and its possible relevance to schizophrenia is proposed. This hypothesis is based on the  regulation of dopamine release into subcortical regions occurring via two independent mechanisms: (1) transient or phasic dopamine release caused by dopamine neuron firing, and (2) sustained, \"background\" tonic dopamine release regulated by prefrontal cortical afferents. Behaviorally relevant stimuli are proposed to cause short-term activation of dopamine cell firing to trigger the phasic component of dopamine release. In contrast, tonic dopamine release is proposed to regulate the intensity of the phasic dopamine response through its effect on extracellular dopamine levels. In this way, tonic dopamine release would set the background level of dopamine receptor stimulation (both autoreceptor and postsynaptic) and, through homeostatic mechanisms, the responsivity of the system to dopamine in these sites. In schizophrenics, a prolonged decrease in prefrontal cortical activity is proposed to reduce tonic dopamine release. Over time, this would elicit homeostatic compensations that would increase overall dopamine responsivity and thereby cause subsequent phasic  dopamine release to elicit abnormally large responses.", "314832": "Small injections of tritiated leucine and proline confined to the ventral tegmental area (AVT) were found to label fibers ascending: (a) to the entire ventromedial half of the striatum, but most massively to the ventral striatal zone that includes the nucleus accumbens; (b) to the thalamus: lateral habenular  nucleus, nuclei reuniens and centralis medius, and the most medial zone of the mediodorsal nucleus; (c) to the posterior hypothalamic nucleus and possibly the lateral hypothalamic and preoptic region; (d) to the nuclei amygdalae centralis,  lateralis and medialis; (e) to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the nucleus of the diagonal band, and the medial half of the lateral septal nucleus;  (f) to the anteromedial (frontocingulate) cortex; and (g) to the entorhinal area. Further AVT efferents descend to the medial half of the midbrain tegmentum including an anterior region of the median raphe nucleus, to the ventral half of  the central grey substance including the dorsal raphe nucleus, to the parabrachial nuclei, and to the locus coeruleus. Similar injections centered in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNC) label fibers that are distributed in the striatum in an orderly medial-to-lateral arrangement, and almost entirely  avoid the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. With the exception of the lateral quarter of the substantia nigra, which apparently does not project to the extreme rostral pole of the striatum, each small SNC locus, regardless of its anteroposterior localization, distributes nigrostriatal fibers throughout the length of the striatum. Descending SNC efferents are distributed to the same general regions that receive descending AVT projections, except that no SNC fibers appear to enter the locus coeruleus. Isotope injections confined to the pars reticulata (SNR) label sparse nigrostriatal fibers, and numerous nigrothalamic fibers ascending mainly to the nucleus ventromedialis and in lesser number to the parafascicular nucleus and the paralamellar zone of the nucleus mediodorsalis. Descending SNR fibers leave the nigra as a voluminous fiber bundle that bifurcates into a large nigrotectal and a smaller nigrotegmental component,  the latter terminating largely in the pedunculopontine nucleus of the pontomesencephalic tegmentum.", "25940212": "Neuromodulative treatment options are warranted in patients with difficult-to-treat epilepsy. However, acquisition of controlled data on deep brain stimulation has so far been achieved only for the centromedian and anterior thalamic nucleus. In a case series of four patients with intractable partial epilepsy, a randomized controlled cross-over protocol was used to get insight into efficacy and safety of 3-month nucleus accumbens stimulation. Seizure frequency, neurocognitive testing, \"Liverpool Seizure Severity Score,\" \"Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory,\" \"Beck Depression Inventory,\" and \"Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview\" were obtained at every visit. In a subsequent open-label phase, nucleus accumbens stimulation responders underwent concomitant anterior thalamic nucleus stimulation, whereas nonresponders received solely thalamic stimulation. Under nucleus accumbens stimulation, three of four patients had \u2265 50% reduction in frequency of disabling seizures without further improvement with additional anterior thalamic nucleus stimulation. Patient-reported outcome and neurocognitive testing remained unchanged. Accumbens stimulation is safe and seems to be a suitable option in intractable partial epilepsy. The current findings require substantiation by an adequately powered multicenter study.", "24801491": "In five adult patients with intractable partial epilepsy, safety and feasibility  of chronic bilateral electrical stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) were assessed, also providing initial indications of therapeutic efficacy. Concurrent  medication remained unchanged. In this phase 1 trial, clinical outcome parameters of interest were Quality of Life in Epilepsy questionnaire (QOLIE-31-P), Beck Depression Inventory, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, neuropsychological testing, and Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale. Those data were obtained after 6 months of NAC stimulation and compared to the equivalent assessments made directly before implantation of electrodes. Additionally, monthly frequencies of simple partial seizures, complex partial seizures (CPS), and generalised tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) were assessed during 3 months before electrode implantation and at the end of 6-month NAC stimulation. Proportion of responders, i.e. \u226550 % reduction in frequency of disabling seizures (sum of CPS and GTCS), was calculated. Main findings were unchanged psychiatric and neuropsychological assessment and a significant decrease in seizure severity (p = 0.043). QOLIE-31-P total score trended towards improvement (p = 0.068). Two out of five participants were responders. The median reduction in frequency of disabling seizures was 37.5 %. In summary, we provide initial evidence for safety and feasibility of chronic electrical stimulation of the NAC in patients with intractable partial epilepsy, as indicated by largely unchanged neurocognitive function and psychiatric comorbidity. Even though our data are underpowered to reliably assess efficacy, the significant decrease in seizure severity provides an initial indication of antiictal efficacy of NAC stimulation. This calls for larger and at best randomised trials to further elucidate efficacy of NAC stimulation in patients with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy.", "23678119": "Theoretical models and empirical work indicate a critical role of the NAcc in salience processing. For instance, the NAcc not only responds to appetitive and aversive information, but it also signals novelty, contextual deviance, and action monitoring. However, because most studies have investigated only one specific type of salience independently, it remains unclear how the NAcc concurrently differentiates between different forms of salience. To investigate this issue, we used intracranial electroencephalography in human epilepsy patients together with a previously established visual oddball paradigm. Here, three different oddball categories (novel, neutral, and target images) were infrequently presented among a standard scene image, and subjects responded to the target via button press. This task allowed us to differentiate \"item novelty\" (new vs neutral oddballs) from \"contextual deviance\" (neutral oddballs vs standard images) and \"targetness\" (target vs neutral oddballs). Time-frequency analysis revealed a dissociation between item novelty and contextual deviance on  the basis of decreases in either \u03b8 (4-8 Hz) or \u03b2 power (20-30 Hz). Targetness, on the other hand, was signaled by positive deflections in the stimulus-locked local field potentials, which, importantly, correlated with subjects' reaction times. These findings indicate that, in an ongoing stream of information, the NAcc differentiates between types of salience by distinct neural mechanisms to guide goal-directed behavior.", "23583113": "Many brain circuits control behavior by integrating information arising from separate inputs onto a common target neuron. Neurons in the ventral striatum (VS) receive converging excitatory afferents from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HP), and thalamus, among other structures, and the integration of these inputs is critical for goal-directed behaviors. Although HP inputs have been described as gating PFC throughput in the VS, recent data reveal that the VS desynchronizes from the HP during epochs of burst-like PFC activity related to decision making. It is therefore possible that PFC inputs locally attenuate responses to other glutamatergic inputs to the VS. Here, we found that delivering trains of stimuli to the PFC suppresses HP- and thalamus-evoked synaptic responses in the VS, in part through activation of inhibitory processes. This interaction may enable the PFC to exert influence on basal ganglia loops during decision-making instances with minimal disturbance from ongoing contextual inputs.", "22623676": "Linking values to actions and evaluating expectations relative to outcomes are both central to reinforcement learning and are thought to underlie financial decision-making. However, neurophysiology studies of these processes in humans remain limited. Here, we recorded the activity of single human nucleus accumbens  neurons while subjects performed a gambling task. We show that the nucleus accumbens encodes two signals related to subject behavior. First, we find that under relatively predictable conditions, single neuronal activity predicts future financial decisions on a trial-by-trial basis. Interestingly, we show that this activity continues to predict decisions even under conditions of uncertainty (e.g., when the probability of winning or losing is 50/50 and no particular financial choice predicts a rewarding outcome). Furthermore, we find that this activity occurs, on average, 2 s before the subjects physically manifest their decision. Second, we find that the nucleus accumbens encodes the difference between expected and realized outcomes, consistent with a prediction error signal. We show this activity occurs immediately after the subject has realized the outcome of the trial and is present on both the individual and population neuron levels. These results provide human single neuronal evidence that the nucleus accumbens is integral in making financial decisions.", "21253357": "This paper describes FieldTrip, an open source software package that we developed for the analysis of MEG, EEG, and other electrophysiological data.

Even when the best available treatments are applied, approximately 10% of patients remain severely afflicted and run a long-term deteriorating course of OCD. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether bilateral deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens is an effective and safe treatment for treatment-refractory OCD. DESIGN: The study consisted of an open 8-month treatment phase, followed by a double-blind crossover phase with randomly assigned 2-week periods of active or sham stimulation, ending with an open 12-month maintenance phase. SETTING: Academic research. Patients Sixteen patients (age range, 18-65 years) with OCD according to DSM-IV criteria meeting stringent criteria for refractoriness to treatment were included in the study. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with bilateral deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary efficacy was assessed by score change from baseline on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Responders were defined by a score decrease of at least 35% on the Y-BOCS. RESULTS: In the open phase, the mean (SD) Y-BOCS score decreased by 46%, from 33.7 (3.6) at baseline to 18.0 (11.4) after 8 months (P < .001). Nine of 16 patients were responders, with a mean (SD) Y-BOCS score decrease of 23.7 (7.0), or 72%. In the double-blind, sham-controlled phase (n = 14), the mean (SD) Y-BOCS score difference between active and sham stimulation was 8.3 (2.3), or 25% (P = .004). Depression and anxiety decreased significantly. Except for mild forgetfulness and word-finding problems, no permanent adverse events were reported.

Here, we report that electrophysiological oscillatory phase synchrony between the two nuclei accumbens may play a crucial role in using negative feedback to guide decision making. We recorded local field potentials from the human nucleus accumbens and the medial frontal cortex (via surface EEG) from patients who had deep brain stimulation electrodes implanted. Patients performed a reversal learning task in which they decided whether to alter their decision strategy following monetary losses. Strategy switches following losses were preceded by enhanced theta (4-8 Hz) phase synchrony between the nuclei accumbens, and a break-down of gamma (20-80 Hz)-alpha (8-12 Hz) coupling. Furthermore, the strength of the intersite phase synchrony predicted response time adjustments in  the subsequent trial. These findings suggest that a neural network including the  nucleus accumbens bilaterally becomes functionally connected via theta phase synchrony to signal the need to adjust behavior.", "19352511": "Reward intake optimization requires a balance between exploiting known sources of rewards and exploring for new sources. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and associated basal ganglia circuits are likely candidates as neural structures responsible for such balance, while the hippocampus may be responsible for spatial/contextual information. Although studies have assessed interactions between hippocampus and  PFC, and between hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens (NA), it is not known whether 3-way interactions among these structures vary under different behavioral conditions. Here, we investigated these interactions with multichannel recordings while rats explored an operant chamber and while they performed a learned lever-pressing task for reward in the same chamber shortly afterward. Neural firing and local field potentials in the NA core synchronized with hippocampal activity during spatial exploration, but during lever pressing they instead synchronized more strongly with the PFC. The latter is likely due to transient drive of NA neurons by bursting prefrontal activation, as in vivo intracellular recordings in anesthetized rats revealed that NA up states can transiently synchronize with spontaneous PFC activity and PFC stimulation with a bursting pattern reliably evoked up states in NA neurons. Thus, the ability to switch synchronization in a task-dependent manner indicates that the NA core can dynamically select its inputs to suit environmental demands, thereby contributing to decision-making, a function that was thought to primarily depend on the PFC.", "19092783": "Learning that certain actions lead to risky rewards is critical for biological, social, and economic survival, but the precise neural mechanisms of such reward-guided learning remain unclear. Here, we show that the human nucleus accumbens plays a key role in learning about risks by representing reward value.  We recorded electrophysiological activity directly from the nucleus accumbens of  five patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for treatment of refractory major depression. Patients engaged in a simple reward-learning task in which they first learned stimulus-outcome associations (learning task), and then were able to choose from among the learned stimuli (choosing task). During the learning task,  nucleus accumbens activity reflected potential and received reward values both during the cue stimulus and during the feedback. During the choosing task, there  was no nucleus accumbens activity during the cue stimulus, but feedback-related activity was pronounced and similar to that during the learning task. This pattern of results is inconsistent with a prediction error response. Finally, analyses of cross-correlations between the accumbens and simultaneous recordings  of medial frontal cortex suggest a dynamic interaction between these structures.  The high spatial and temporal resolution of these recordings provides novel insights into the timing of activity in the human nucleus accumbens, its functions during reward-guided learning and decision-making, and its interactions with medial frontal cortex.", "18786735": "The nucleus accumbens regulates goal-directed behaviors by integrating information from limbic structures and the prefrontal cortex.

It is thought to \"gate\" the flow of a diverse range of information (e.g., rewarding, aversive, and novel events) from limbic afferents to basal ganglia outputs. Gating and information encoding may be achieved via cross-frequency coupling, in which bursts of high-frequency activity occur preferentially during  specific phases of slower oscillations. We examined whether the human nucleus accumbens engages such a mechanism by recording electrophysiological activity directly from the accumbens of human patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. Oscillatory activity in the gamma (40-80 Hz) frequency range was synchronized with the phase of simultaneous alpha (8-12 Hz) waves. Further, losing and winning small amounts of money elicited relatively increased gamma oscillation power prior to and following alpha troughs, respectively. Gamma-alpha synchronization may reflect an electrophysiological gating mechanism in the human nucleus accumbens, and the phase differences in gamma-alpha coupling may reflect  a reward information coding scheme similar to phase coding.", "16510723": "The ability to behave in a flexible manner is an executive function mediated in part by different regions of the prefrontal cortex. The present study investigated the role of two major efferents of the prefrontal cortex, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell, in behavioral flexibility using a maze-based strategy set-shifting task. During initial discrimination training, rats learned to use either an egocentric response or a visual-cue discrimination  strategy to obtain food reward. During the set shift, animals had to shift from the previously acquired response or visual-cue-based strategy and learn the alternate discrimination. Inactivation of the NAc core, induced by infusion of the GABA agonists baclofen and muscimol, did not impair initial acquisition of either a response or visual-cue discrimination but severely disrupted shifting from one strategy to another. Analysis of the type of errors revealed that impairments in set shifting were not attributable to increased perseveration but  to a disruption of the acquisition and maintenance of a new strategy. In contrast, inactivation of the NAc shell did not impair acquisition of either a response or a visual-cue discrimination, or shifting from one strategy to another. However, inactivation of the NAc shell before initial discrimination training improved performance during the set shift relative to control animals. These data indicate that the NAc core and shell make dissociable contributions to behavioral flexibility during set shifting. The NAc core facilitates the acquisition and maintenance of novel behavioral strategies and elimination of inappropriate response options, whereas the shell may mediate learning about irrelevant stimuli.", "16487726": "Reward probability has been shown to be coded by dopamine neurons in monkeys. Phasic neuronal activation not only increased linearly with reward probability upon expectation of reward, but also varied monotonically across the range of probabilities upon omission or receipt of rewards, therefore modeling discrepancies between expected and received rewards. Such a discrete coding of prediction error has been suggested to be one of the basic principles of learning. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to show that the human dopamine system codes reward probability and prediction error in a similar  way. We used a simple delayed incentive task with a discrete range of reward probabilities from 0%-100%. Activity in the nucleus accumbens of human subjects strongly resembled the phasic responses found in monkey neurons. First, during the expectation period of the task, the fMRI signal in the human nucleus accumbens (NAc) increased linearly with the probability of the reward. Second, during the outcome phase, activity in the NAc coded the prediction error as a linear function of reward probabilities. Third, we found that the Nac signal was  correlated with individual differences in sensation seeking and novelty seeking,  indicating a link between individual fMRI activation of the dopamine system in a  probabilistic paradigm and personality traits previously suggested to be linked with reward processing. We therefore identify two different covariates that model activity in the Nac: specific properties of a psychological task and individual character traits.", "15087550": "Instrumental conditioning studies how animals and humans choose actions appropriate to the affective structure of an environment. According to recent reinforcement learning models, two distinct components are involved: a \"critic,\"  which learns to predict future reward, and an \"actor,\" which maintains information about the rewarding outcomes of actions to enable better ones to be chosen more frequently. We scanned human participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they engaged in instrumental conditioning. Our results suggest partly dissociable contributions of the ventral and dorsal striatum, with the former corresponding to the critic and the latter corresponding to the actor.", "11375482": "Impulsive choice is exemplified by choosing a small or poor reward that is available immediately, in preference to a larger but delayed reward. Impulsive choice contributes to drug addiction, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mania, and personality disorders, but its neuroanatomical basis is unclear. Here, we show that selective lesions of the nucleus accumbens core induce persistent impulsive choice in rats. In contrast, damage to two of its afferents, the anterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, had no effect on this capacity. Thus, dysfunction of the nucleus accumbens core may be a key element in the neuropathology of impulsivity.", "11312310": "In three experiments we examined the effect of bilateral excitotoxic lesions of the nucleus accumbens core or shell subregions on instrumental performance, outcome devaluation, degradation of the instrumental contingency, Pavlovian conditioning, and Pavlovian-instrumental transfer. Rats were food deprived and trained to press two levers, one delivering food pellets and the other a sucrose  solution. All animals acquired the lever-press response although the rate of acquisition and overall response rates in core-lesioned animals were depressed relative to that in the shell- or sham-lesioned animals. Furthermore, in shell- and sham-lesioned rats, post-training devaluation of one of the two outcomes using a specific satiety procedure produced a selective reduction in performance  on the lever that, in training, delivered the prefed outcome. In contrast, the core-lesioned rats failed to show a selective devaluation effect and reduced responding on both levers. Subsequent tests revealed that these effects of core lesions were not caused by an impairment in their ability to recall the devalued  outcome, to discriminate the two outcomes, or to encode the instrumental action-outcome contingencies to which they were exposed. Additionally, the core lesions did not have any marked effect on Pavlovian conditioning or on Pavlovian-instrumental transfer. Importantly, although shell-lesioned rats showed no deficit in any test of instrumental conditioning or in Pavlovian conditioning, they failed to show any positive transfer in the Pavlovian-instrumental transfer  test. This double dissociation suggests that nucleus accumbens core and shell differentially mediate the impact of instrumental and Pavlovian incentive processes, respectively, on instrumental performance.", "10719160": "Although first thought of as a dopaminergic disorder, there is little direct evidence to support a primary pathology in the dopamine system as the etiological factor in schizophrenia. In contrast, evidence is amassing in support of a cortical disturbance in this disorder; one consequence of which is a disruption in the cortical regulation of subcortical dopamine systems. Our studies show that the hippocampus plays a major role in this interaction, in that, along with the dopamine system, it provides a gating influence over information flow from the prefrontal cortex at the level of the nucleus accumbens. Moreover, chemically-induced disruption of the development of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex were found to lead to pathophysiological changes in these interactions in the limbic system of adult rats. Therefore, schizophrenia is proposed to be a developmentally-related disorder, in which disruption of the hippocampal influence over the limbic system during ontogeny results in a pathological alteration of corticoaccumbens interactions in the adult organism.", "28123013": "Distinct populations of D1- and D2-dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-/D2-MSNs) comprise the nucleus accumbens, and activity in D1-MSNs promotes, whereas activity in D2-MSNs inhibits, motivated behaviors. We used chemogenetics to extend D1-/D2-MSN cell specific regulation to cue-reinstated cocaine seeking in a mouse model of self-administration and relapse, and found that either increasing activity in D1-MSNs or decreasing activity in D2-MSNs augmented cue-induced reinstatement. Both D1- and D2-MSNs provide substantial GABAergic innervation to the ventral pallidum, and chemogenetic inhibition of ventral pallidal neurons blocked the augmented reinstatement elicited by chemogenetic regulation of either D1- or D2-MSNs. Because D1- and D2-MSNs innervate overlapping populations of ventral pallidal neurons, we next used optogenetics to examine whether changes in synaptic plasticity in D1- versus D2-MSN GABAergic synapses in the ventral pallidum could explain the differential  regulation of VP activity. In mice trained to self-administer cocaine, GABAergic  LTD was abolished in D2-, but not in D1-MSN synapses. A \u03bc opioid receptor antagonist restored GABA currents in D2-, but not D1-MSN synapses of cocaine-trained mice, indicating that increased enkephalin tone on presynaptic \u03bc  opioid receptors was responsible for occluding the LTD. These results identify a  behavioral function for D1-MSN innervation of the ventral pallidum, and suggest that losing LTDGABA in D2-MSN, but not D1-MSN input to ventral pallidum may promote cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: More than 90% of ventral striatum is composed of two cell types, those expressing dopamine D1 or D2 receptors, which exert opposing roles on motivated behavior. Both cell types send GABAergic projections to the ventral pallidum and were found to differentially promote cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking via the ventral pallidum. Furthermore, after cocaine self-administration, synaptic plasticity was selectively lost in D2, but not D1 inputs to the ventral pallidum. The selective impairment in D2 afferents may promote the influence of D1 inputs to drive relapse to cocaine seeking.", "27235078": "The striatum has been involved in complex behaviors such as motor control, learning, decision-making, reward and aversion. The striatum is mainly composed of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), typically divided into those expressing dopamine  receptor D1, forming the so-called direct pathway, and those expressing D2 receptor (indirect pathway). For decades it has been proposed that these two populations exhibit opposing control over motor output, and recently, the same dichotomy has been proposed for valenced behaviors. Whereas D1-MSNs mediate reinforcement and reward, D2-MSNs have been associated with punishment and aversion. In this review we will discuss pharmacological, genetic and optogenetic studies that indicate that there is still controversy to what concerns the role of striatal D1- and D2-MSNs in this type of behaviors, highlighting the need to reconsider the early view that they mediate solely opposing aspects of valenced behaviour.", "26946381": "BACKGROUND: As a more detailed picture of nervous system function emerges, diversity of astrocyte function becomes more widely appreciated. While it has been shown that cocaine experience impairs astroglial glutamate uptake and release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), few studies have explored effects of self-administration on the structure and physiology of astrocytes. We investigated the effects of extinction from daily cocaine self-administration on  astrocyte characteristics including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, surface area, volume, and colocalization with a synaptic marker. METHODS: Cocaine or saline self-administration and extinction were paired with GFAP Westerns, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescent imaging of NAc core astrocytes (30 saline-administering and 36 cocaine-administering male Sprague Dawley rats were employed). Imaging was performed using a membrane-tagged lymphocyte protein tyrosine kinase-green fluorescent protein (Lck-GFP) driven by  the GFAP promoter, coupled with synapsin I immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: GFAP expression was significantly reduced in the NAc core following cocaine self-administration and extinction. Similarly, we observed an overall smaller surface area and volume of astrocytes, as well as reduced colocalization  with synapsin I, in cocaine-administering animals. Cocaine-mediated reductions in synaptic contact were reversed by the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple lines of investigation indicate that NAc core astrocytes exist in a hyporeactive state following cocaine self-administration and extinction. Decreased association with synaptic elements may be particularly meaningful, as cessation of chronic cocaine use is associated with changes in synaptic strength and resistance to the induction of synaptic plasticity. We hypothesize that the reduced synaptic colocalization of astrocytes represents an  important maladaptive cellular response to cocaine and the mechanisms underlying  relapse vulnerability.", "25861696": "BACKGROUND: Glial cells of the central nervous system directly influence neuronal activity by releasing neuroactive small molecules, including glutamate. Long-lasting cocaine-induced reductions in extracellular glutamate in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) affect synaptic plasticity responsible for relapse vulnerability. METHODS: We transduced NAcore astrocytes with an adeno-associated virus vector expressing hM3D designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADD) under control of the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter in 62 male Sprague Dawley rats, 4 dominant-negative soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor mice, and 4 wild-type littermates. Using glutamate biosensors, we measured NAcore glutamate levels following intracranial  or systemic administration of clozapine N-oxide (CNO) and tested the ability of systemic CNO to inhibit reinstated cocaine or sucrose seeking following self-administration and extinction training. RESULTS: Administration of CNO in glial fibrillary acidic protein-hM3D-DREADD transfected animals increased NAcore extracellular glutamate levels in vivo. The  glial origin of released glutamate was validated by an absence of CNO-mediated release in mice expressing a dominant-negative soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor variant in glia. Also, CNO-mediated release was relatively insensitive to N-type calcium channel blockade. Systemic administration of CNO inhibited cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking in rats extinguished from cocaine but not sucrose self-administration. The capacity  to inhibit reinstated cocaine seeking was prevented by systemic administration of the group II metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist LY341495. CONCLUSIONS: DREADD-mediated glutamate gliotransmission inhibited cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking by stimulating release-regulating group II metabotropic glutamate receptor autoreceptors to inhibit cue-induced synaptic glutamate spillover.", "24741055": "Reducing the enduring vulnerability to relapse is a therapeutic goal in treating  drug addiction. Studies with animal models of drug addiction show a marked increase in extrasynaptic glutamate in the core subcompartment of the nucleus accumbens (NAcore) during reinstated drug seeking. However, the synaptic mechanisms linking drug-induced changes in extrasynaptic glutamate to relapse are poorly understood. Here, we discovered impaired glutamate elimination in rats extinguished from heroin self-administration that leads to spillover of synaptically released glutamate into the nonsynaptic extracellular space in NAcore and investigated whether restoration of glutamate transport prevented reinstated heroin seeking. Through multiple functional assays of glutamate uptake and analyzing NMDA receptor-mediated currents, we show that heroin self-administration produced long-lasting downregulation of glutamate uptake and  surface expression of the transporter GLT-1. This downregulation was associated with spillover of synaptic glutamate to extrasynaptic NMDA receptors within the NAcore. Ceftriaxone restored glutamate uptake and prevented synaptic glutamate spillover and cue-induced heroin seeking. Ceftriaxone-induced inhibition of reinstated heroin seeking was blocked by morpholino-antisense targeting GLT-1 synthesis. These data reveal that the synaptic glutamate spillover in the NAcore  results from reduced glutamate transport and is a critical pathophysiological mechanism underling reinstated drug seeking in rats extinguished from heroin self-administration.", "23639436": "Chronic use of addictive drugs produces enduring neuroadaptations in the corticostriatal glutamatergic brain circuitry. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), which integrates cortical information and regulates goal-directed behavior, undergoes long-term morphological and electrophysiological changes that may underlie the increased susceptibility for relapse in drug-experienced individuals even after long periods of withdrawal. Additionally, it has recently been shown that exposure to cues associated with drug use elicits rapid and transient morphological and electrophysiological changes in glutamatergic synapses in the NAc. This review highlights these dynamic drug-induced changes in this pathway that are specific to a drug seeking neuropathology, as well as how these changes  impair normal information processing and thereby contribute to the uncontrollable motivation to relapse. Future directions for relapse prevention and pharmacotherapeutic targeting of the rapid, transient synaptic plasticity in relapse are discussed.

It is not known how cues elicit cocaine seeking, and why cocaine seeking is more difficult to regulate than seeking a natural reward. We found that cocaine-associated cues initiate cocaine seeking by inducing a rapid, transient increase in dendritic spine size and synaptic strength in the nucleus accumbens. These changes required neural activity in the  prefrontal cortex. This is not the case when identical cues were associated with  obtaining sucrose, which did not elicit changes in spine size or synaptic strength. The marked cue-induced synaptic changes in the accumbens were correlated with the intensity of cocaine, but not sucrose seeking, and may explain the difficulty addicts experience in managing relapse to cocaine use.", "21811439": "The striatum plays a key role in mediating the acute and chronic effects of addictive drugs, with drugs of abuse causing long-lasting molecular and cellular  alterations in both dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens (ventral striatum). Despite the wealth of research on the biological actions of abused drugs in striatum, until recently, the distinct roles of the striatum's two major subtypes of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in drug addiction remained elusive. Recent advances in cell-type-specific technologies, including fluorescent reporter mice, transgenic, or knockout mice, and viral-mediated gene transfer, have advanced the field toward a more comprehensive understanding of the two MSN subtypes in the long-term actions of drugs of abuse. Here we review progress in defining the distinct molecular and functional contributions of the two MSN subtypes in mediating addiction.", "11369436": "Brain tissue has a remarkable ability to accumulate glutamate. This ability is due to glutamate transporter proteins present in the plasma membranes of both glial cells and neurons. The transporter proteins represent the only (significant) mechanism for removal of glutamate from the extracellular fluid and their importance for the long-term maintenance of low and non-toxic concentrations of glutamate is now well documented. In addition to this simple, but essential glutamate removal role, the glutamate transporters appear to have more sophisticated functions in the modulation of neurotransmission. They may modify the time course of synaptic events, the extent and pattern of activation and desensitization of receptors outside the synaptic cleft and at neighboring synapses (intersynaptic cross-talk). Further, the glutamate transporters provide  glutamate for synthesis of e.g. GABA, glutathione and protein, and for energy production. They also play roles in peripheral organs and tissues (e.g. bone, heart, intestine, kidneys, pancreas and placenta). Glutamate uptake appears to be modulated on virtually all possible levels, i.e. DNA transcription, mRNA splicing and degradation, protein synthesis and targeting, and actual amino acid transport activity and associated ion channel activities. A variety of soluble compounds (e.g. glutamate, cytokines and growth factors) influence glutamate transporter expression and activities. Neither the normal functioning of glutamatergic synapses nor the pathogenesis of major neurological diseases (e.g. cerebral ischemia, hypoglycemia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy and schizophrenia) as well as non-neurological diseases (e.g. osteoporosis) can be properly understood unless more is learned about these transporter proteins. Like glutamate itself, glutamate transporters are somehow involved in almost all aspects of normal and abnormal brain activity.", "10436047": "Recent studies show that glutamate transporter-mediated currents occur in astrocytes when glutamate is released from hippocampal synapses. These transporters remove excess glutamate from the extracellular space, thereby facilitating synaptic input specificity and preventing neurotoxicity. Little is known about the position of astrocytic processes at hippocampal synapses. Serial  electron microscopy and three-dimensional analyses were used to investigate structural relationships between astrocytes and synapses in stratum radiatum of hippocampal area CA1 in the mature rat in vivo and in slices. Only 57 +/- 11% of  the synapses had astrocytic processes apposed to them. Of these, the astrocytic processes surrounded less than half (0.43 +/- 22) of the synaptic interface. Other studies suggest that astrocytes extend processes toward higher concentrations of glutamate; thus the presence of astrocytic processes at particular hippocampal synapses might signal which ones are releasing glutamate.  The distance between nearest neighboring synapses was usually (approximately 95%) <1 microgram. Astrocytic processes occurred along the extracellular path between  33% of the neighboring synapses, neuronal processes occurred along the path between another 66% of the neighboring synapses, and only 1% of the synapses were close enough such that neither astrocytic nor neuronal processes occurred between them. These morphological arrangements suggest that the glutamate released at approximately two-thirds of hippocampal synapses might diffuse to other synapses, unless neuronal glutamate transporters are more effective than previously reported. The findings also suggest that physiological recordings made from hippocampal astrocytes do not uniformly sample the glutamate released from all hippocampal synapses.", "26276628": "Advances in neuroscience identified addiction as a chronic brain disease with strong genetic, neurodevelopmental, and sociocultural components. We here discuss the circuit- and cell-level mechanisms of this condition and its co-option of pathways regulating reward, self-control, and affect. Drugs of abuse exert their  initial reinforcing effects by triggering supraphysiologic surges of dopamine in  the nucleus accumbens that activate the direct striatal pathway via D1 receptors  and inhibit the indirect striato-cortical pathway via D2 receptors. Repeated drug administration triggers neuroplastic changes in glutamatergic inputs to the striatum and midbrain dopamine neurons, enhancing the brain's reactivity to drug  cues, reducing the sensitivity to non-drug rewards, weakening self-regulation, and increasing the sensitivity to stressful stimuli and dysphoria. Drug-induced impairments are long lasting; thus, interventions designed to mitigate or even reverse them would be beneficial for the treatment of addiction.", "20228805": "Psychopathy is a personality disorder that is strongly linked to criminal behavior.

These findings suggest that neurochemical and neurophysiological hyper-reactivity of the dopaminergic reward system may comprise a neural substrate for impulsive-antisocial behavior and substance abuse in psychopathy.", "19411368": "OBJECTIVE: Major depressive disorder is characterized by impaired reward processing, possibly due to dysfunction in the basal ganglia. However, few neuroimaging studies of depression have distinguished between anticipatory and consummatory phases of reward processing. Using functional MRI (fMRI) and a task  that dissociates anticipatory and consummatory phases of reward processing, the authors tested the hypothesis that individuals with major depression would show reduced reward-related responses in basal ganglia structures. METHOD: A monetary incentive delay task was presented to 30 unmedicated individuals with major depressive disorder and 31 healthy comparison subjects during fMRI scanning. Whole-brain analyses focused on neural responses to reward-predicting cues and rewarding outcomes (i.e., monetary gains). Secondary analyses focused on the relationship between anhedonic symptoms and basal ganglia volumes. RESULTS: Relative to comparison subjects, participants with major depression showed significantly weaker responses to gains in the left nucleus accumbens and  the caudate bilaterally. Group differences in these regions were specific to rewarding outcomes and did not generalize to neutral or negative outcomes, although relatively reduced responses to monetary penalties in the major depression group emerged in other caudate regions. By contrast, evidence for group differences during reward anticipation was weaker, although participants with major depression showed reduced activation to reward cues in a small sector  of the left posterior putamen. In the major depression group, anhedonic symptoms  and depression severity were associated with reduced caudate volume bilaterally. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that basal ganglia dysfunction in major depression may affect the consummatory phase of reward processing. Additionally,  morphometric results suggest that anhedonia in major depression is related to caudate volume.", "11459880": "Comparative studies have implicated the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in the anticipation of incentives, but the relative responsiveness of this neural substrate during anticipation of rewards versus punishments remains unclear. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated whether the anticipation of increasing monetary rewards and punishments would increase NAcc blood oxygen level-dependent contrast (hereafter, \"activation\") in  eight healthy volunteers. Whereas anticipation of increasing rewards elicited both increasing self-reported happiness and NAcc activation, anticipation of increasing punishment elicited neither. However, anticipation of both rewards and punishments activated a different striatal region (the medial caudate). At the highest reward level ($5.00), NAcc activation was correlated with individual differences in self-reported happiness elicited by the reward cues. These findings suggest that whereas other striatal areas may code for expected incentive magnitude, a region in the NAcc codes for expected positive incentive value.", "5146491": "DOI: 10.1016/0028-3932(71)90067-4  PMID: 5146491  [Indexed for MEDLINE]", "29386133": "The basolateral amygdala (BLA) mediates associative learning for both fear and reward.

Although there is consensus regarding the existence of distinct subsets of BLA neurons encoding positive or negative valence, controversy remains regarding the anatomical arrangement of these populations. First, we map the location of more than 1,000 neurons distributed across the BLA  and recorded during a Pavlovian discrimination task. Next, we determine the location of projection-defined neurons labeled with retrograde tracers and use CLARITY to reveal the axonal path in 3-dimensional space. Finally, we examine the local influence of each projection-defined populations within the BLA.

However, when contingency management is discontinued, most addicts relapse to drug use. The brain mechanisms underlying relapse after cessation of contingency management are largely unknown, and, until recently, an  animal model of this human condition did not exist. Here we used a novel rat model, in which the availability of a mutually exclusive palatable food maintains prolonged voluntary abstinence from intravenous methamphetamine self-administration, to demonstrate that the activation of monosynaptic glutamatergic projections from anterior insular cortex to central amygdala is critical to relapse after the cessation of contingency management. We identified  the anterior insular cortex-to-central amygdala projection as a new addiction- and motivation-related projection and a potential target for relapse prevention.", "27720486": "Efficient retrograde access to projection neurons for the delivery of sensors and effectors constitutes an important and enabling capability for neural circuit dissection. Such an approach would also be useful for gene therapy, including the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by pathological spread through functionally connected and highly distributed networks.

To address this need, we applied in\u00a0vivo directed evolution to engineer potent retrograde functionality into the capsid of adeno-associated virus (AAV), a vector that has shown promise in neuroscience research and the clinic.

Due to the wide variety of behavioral approaches many questions remain on the circumscribed role of BLA in appetitive behavior. In this review, we integrate conclusions of BLA function in reward-related behavior using traditional interference techniques (lesion, pharmacological inactivation) with those using newer methodological approaches in experimental animals that allow in vivo manipulation of cell type-specific populations and neural recordings. Secondly, from a review of appetitive behavioral tasks in rodents and monkeys and recent computational models of reward procurement, we derive evidence for BLA as  a neural integrator of reward value, history, and cost parameters. Taken together, BLA codes specific and temporally dynamic outcome representations in a  distributed network to orchestrate adaptive responses. We provide evidence that experiences with opiates and psychostimulants alter these outcome representations in BLA, resulting in long-term modified action.", "24460492": "OBJECT: There is increasing interest in deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of addiction. Initial testing must be conducted in animals, and the alcohol-preferring (P) rat meets the criteria for an animal model of alcoholism.  This study is composed of 2 experiments designed to examine the effects of 1) pharmacological inactivation and 2) DBS of the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) on the consumption of alcohol by P rats. METHODS: In the first experiment, the effects of reversible inactivation of the AcbSh were investigated by administering intracranial injections of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists. Bilateral microinjections of drug were administered to the AcbSh in P rats (8-10 rats/group), after which the animals were placed in operant chambers containing 2 levers--one used to administer water and the other to administer 15% EtOH--to examine the acquisition and maintenance  of oral EtOH self-administration. In the second experiment, a DBS electrode was placed in each P rat's left AcbSh. The animals then received 100 or 200 \u03bcA (3-4 rats/group) of DBS to examine the effect on daily consumption of oral EtOH in a free-access paradigm. RESULTS: In the first experiment, pharmacological silencing of the AcbSh with GABA agonists did not decrease the acquisition of EtOH drinking behavior but did  reduce EtOH consumption by 55% in chronically drinking rats. Similarly, in the second experiment, 200 \u03bcA of DBS consistently reduced EtOH intake by 47% in chronically drinking rats. The amount of EtOH consumption returned to baseline levels following termination of therapy in both experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological silencing and DBS of the AcbSh reduced EtOH intake after chronic EtOH use had been established in rodents. The AcbSh is a neuroanatomical substrate for the reinforcing effects of alcohol and may be a target for surgical intervention in cases of alcoholism.", "23817545": "Compulsive drinking despite serious adverse medical, social and economic consequences is a characteristic of alcohol use disorders in humans. Although frontal cortical areas have been implicated in alcohol use disorders, little is known about the molecular mechanisms and pathways that sustain aversion-resistant intake. Here, we show that nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) NMDA-type glutamate receptors and medial prefrontal (mPFC) and insula glutamatergic inputs to the NAcore are necessary for aversion-resistant alcohol consumption in rats. Aversion-resistant intake was associated with a new type of NMDA receptor adaptation, in which hyperpolarization-active NMDA receptors were present at mPFC and insula but not amygdalar inputs in the NAcore. Accordingly, inhibition of Grin2c NMDA receptor subunits in the NAcore reduced aversion-resistant alcohol intake. None of these manipulations altered intake when alcohol was not paired with an aversive consequence. Our results identify a mechanism by which hyperpolarization-active NMDA receptors under mPFC- and insula-to-NAcore inputs sustain aversion-resistant alcohol intake.", "20603217": "Preclinical models have consistently demonstrated the importance of the mesocorticolimbic (MCL) brain reward system in drug dependence, with critical molecular and cellular neuroadaptations identified within these structures following chronic cocaine administration. Cocaine dependent individuals manifest  alterations in reward functioning that may relate to changes induced by cocaine or to pre-existing differences related to vulnerability to addiction. The circuit level manifestations of these drug-induced plastic changes and predispositions to drug dependence are poorly understood in preclinical models and virtually unknown in human drug dependence. Using whole-brain resting-state fMRI connectivity analysis with 'seed voxels' placed within individual nodes of the MCL system, we  report network-specific functional connectivity strength decreases in cocaine users within distinct circuits of the system, including between ventral tegmental area (VTA) and a region encompassing thalamus/lentiform nucleus/nucleus accumbens, between amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and between hippocampus and dorsal mPFC. Further, regression analysis on regions showing significant functional connectivity decrease in chronic cocaine users revealed that the circuit strength between VTA and thalamus/lentiform nucleus/nucleus accumbens was negatively correlated with years of cocaine use. This is the first  evidence of circuit-related changes in human cocaine dependence and is consistent with the range of cognitive and behavioral disruptions seen in cocaine dependence. As potential circuit level biomarkers of cocaine dependence, these circuit alterations may be usefully applied in treatment development and monitoring treatment outcome.", "30478293": "Reward drives motivated behaviours and is essential for survival, and therefore there is strong evolutionary pressure to retain contextual information about rewarding stimuli. This drive may be abnormally strong, such as in addiction, or  weak, such as in depression, in which anhedonia (loss of pleasure in response to  rewarding stimuli) is a prominent symptom. Hippocampal input to the shell of the  nucleus accumbens (NAc) is important for driving NAc activity1,2 and activity-dependent modulation of the strength of this input may contribute to the proper regulation of goal-directed behaviours. However, there have been few robust descriptions of the mechanisms that underlie the induction or expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) at these synapses, and there is, to our knowledge, no evidence about whether such plasticity contributes to reward-related behaviour. Here we show that high-frequency activity induces LTP at hippocampus-NAc synapses in mice via canonical, but dopamine-independent, mechanisms. The induction of LTP at this synapse in vivo drives conditioned place preference, and activity at this synapse is required for conditioned place preference in response to a natural reward. Conversely, chronic stress, which induces anhedonia, decreases the strength of this synapse and impairs LTP, whereas antidepressant treatment is accompanied by a reversal of these stress-induced changes. We conclude that hippocampus-NAc synapses show activity-dependent plasticity and suggest that their strength may be critical for contextual reward behaviour.", "30185462": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is critical for motivated behavior and is rewired following exposure to drugs of abuse. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc express either D1 or D2 receptors and project to distinct downstream targets. Differential activation of these MSNs depends on both excitation from long-range  inputs and inhibition via the local circuit. Assessing how long-range excitatory  inputs engage inhibitory circuitry is therefore important for understanding NAc function. Here, we use slice electrophysiology and optogenetics to study ventral  hippocampal (vHPC)-evoked feedforward inhibition in the NAc of male and female mice. We find that vHPC-evoked excitation is stronger at D1+ than D1- MSNs, whereas inhibition is unbiased at the two cell types. vHPC inputs contact both parvalbumin-positive (PV+) and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) interneurons, but PV+ cells are preferentially activated. Moreover, suppressing PV+ interneurons indicates they are primarily responsible for vHPC-evoked inhibition. Finally, repeated cocaine exposure alters the excitation of D1+ and D1- MSNs, without concomitant changes to inhibition, shifting the excitation/inhibition balance. Together, our results highlight the contributions of multiple interneuron populations to feedforward inhibition in the NAc. Moreover, they demonstrate that inhibition provides a stable backdrop on which drug-evoked changes to excitation  occur within this circuit.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Given the importance of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in reward learning and drug-seeking behaviors, it is critical to understand what controls the activity of cells in this region. While  excitatory inputs to projection neurons in the NAc have been identified, it is unclear how the local inhibitory network becomes engaged. Here, we identify a sparse population of interneurons responsible for feedforward inhibition evoked by ventral hippocampal input and characterize their connections within the NAc. We also demonstrate that the balance of excitation and inhibition that projection neurons experience is altered by exposure to cocaine.

Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors regulate NAcSh synaptic strength by inducing long-term depression (LTD).

We examined Group I mGlu receptor regulation of PFC and MDT glutamatergic synapses onto specific populations of NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs) using D1tdTom BAC transgenic mice and optogenetics. Synaptically evoked long-term depression (LTD) at MDT-NAcSh synapses required mGlu5 but not mGlu1 and was specific for D1(+) MSNs, whereas PFC LTD was expressed at both D1(+) and D1(-) MSNs and required mGlu1 but not mGlu5. Two weeks after five daily non-contingent  cocaine exposures (15\u2009mg/kg), LTD was attenuated at MDT-D1(+) synapses but was rescued by the mGlu5-positive allosteric modulator (PAM) VU0409551.

Specifically, BLA-to-NAcSh projections predominantly innervated NAcSh FSIs compared with MSNs and triggered action potentials in FSIs  preceding BLA-mediated activation of MSNs. Due to these anatomical and temporal properties, activation of the BLA-to-NAcSh projection resulted in a rapid FSI-mediated inhibition of MSNs, timing-contingently dictating BLA-evoked activation of MSNs. Cocaine self-administration selectively and persistently up-regulated the presynaptic release probability of BLA-to-FSI synapses, entailing enhanced FSI-mediated feedforward inhibition of MSNs upon BLA activation. Experimentally enhancing the BLA-to-FSI transmission in vivo expedited the acquisition of cocaine self-administration. These results reveal a  previously unidentified role of an FSI-embedded circuit in regulating NAc-based drug seeking and taking.", "28123012": "Relapse to drug use can be initiated by drug-associated cues. The intensity of cue-induced relapse is correlated with the induction of transient synaptic potentiation (t-SP) at glutamatergic synapses on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) and requires spillover of glutamate from prefrontal cortical afferents. We used a rodent self-administration/reinstatement model of relapse to show that cue-induced t-SP and reinstated cocaine seeking result from glutamate spillover, initiating a metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5)-dependent increase in nitric oxide (NO) production. Pharmacological stimulation of mGluR5 in NAcore recapitulated cue-induced reinstatement in the absence of drug-associated cues. Using NO-sensitive electrodes, mGluR5 activation by glutamate was shown to stimulate NO production that depended on activation of  neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). nNOS is expressed in \u223c1% of NAcore neurons. Using a transgene strategy to express and stimulate designer receptors that mimicked mGluR5 signaling through Gq in nNOS interneurons, we recapitulated  cue-induced reinstatement in the absence of cues. Conversely, using a transgenic  caspase strategy, the intensity of cue-induced reinstatement was correlated with  the extent of selective elimination of nNOS interneurons. The induction of t-SP during cued reinstatement depends on activating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)  and selective chemogenetic stimulation of nNOS interneurons recapitulated MMP activation and t-SP induction (increase in AMPA currents in MSNs). These data demonstrate critical involvement of a sparse population of nNOS-expressing interneurons in cue-induced cocaine seeking, revealing a bottleneck in brain processing of drug-associated cues where therapeutic interventions could be effective in treating drug addiction.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Relapse to cocaine use in a rat model is associated with transient increases in synaptic strength at prefrontal cortex synapses in the nucleus accumbens. We demonstrate the sequence  of events that mediates synaptic potentiation and reinstated cocaine seeking induced by cocaine-conditioned cues. Activation of prefrontal inputs to the accumbens by cues initiates spillover of synaptic glutamate, which stimulates metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) on a small population of interneurons  (\u223c1%) expressing neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Stimulating these glutamate receptors increases nitric oxide (NO) production, which stimulates matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 activity in the extracellular space. Manipulating the interaction between mGluR5, NO production, or MMP-2 and MMP-9 pharmacologically or genetically is sufficient to recapitulate transient synaptic potentiation and reinstate cocaine seeking.", "28114294": "Afferent inputs to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) control reward-related behaviors through regulation of dopamine neuron activity. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) provides one of the most prominent projections to the VTA; however, recent  studies have provided conflicting evidence regarding the function of these inhibitory inputs. Using optogenetics, cell-specific ablation, whole cell patch-clamp and immuno-electron microscopy, we found that NAc inputs synapsed directly onto dopamine neurons, preferentially activating GABAB receptors. GABAergic inputs from the NAc and local VTA GABA neurons were differentially modulated and activated separate receptor populations in dopamine neurons. Genetic deletion of GABAB receptors from dopamine neurons in adult mice did not affect general or morphine-induced locomotor activity, but markedly increased cocaine-induced locomotion. Collectively, our findings demonstrate notable selectivity in the inhibitory architecture of the VTA and suggest that long-range GABAergic inputs to dopamine neurons fundamentally regulate behavioral responses  to cocaine.", "27929113": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) gates motivated behaviors through the functional output of principle medium spiny neurons (MSNs), whereas dysfunctional output of  NAc MSNs contributes to a variety of psychiatric disorders. Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are sparsely distributed throughout the NAc, forming local feedforward inhibitory circuits. It remains elusive how FSI-based feedforward circuits regulate the output of NAc MSNs. Here, we investigated a distinct subpopulation of NAc FSIs that express the cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1). Using a combination of paired electrophysiological recordings and pharmacological approaches, we characterized and compared feedforward inhibition of NAc MSNs from CB1+ FSIs and lateral inhibition from recurrent MSN collaterals. We observed that CB1+ FSIs exerted robust inhibitory control over a large percentage of nearby MSNs in contrast to local MSN collaterals that provided only sparse and weak inhibitory input to their neighboring MSNs. Furthermore, CB1+ FSI-mediated feedforward inhibition was preferentially suppressed by endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling, whereas MSN-mediated lateral inhibition was unaffected. Finally, we demonstrated that CB1+ FSI synapses onto MSNs are capable of undergoing experience-dependent long-term depression in a voltage- and eCB-dependent manner. These findings demonstrated that CB1+ FSIs are a major source of local inhibitory control of MSNs and a critical component of the feedforward inhibitory circuits regulating the output of the NAc.", "27475769": "Drug addiction represents a dramatic dysregulation of motivational circuits that  is caused by a combination of exaggerated incentive salience and habit formation, reward deficits and stress surfeits, and compromised executive function in three  stages. The rewarding effects of drugs of abuse, development of incentive salience, and development of drug-seeking habits in the binge/intoxication stage  involve changes in dopamine and opioid peptides in the basal ganglia. The increases in negative emotional states and dysphoric and stress-like responses in the withdrawal/negative affect stage involve decreases in the function of the dopamine component of the reward system and recruitment of brain stress neurotransmitters, such as corticotropin-releasing factor and dynorphin, in the neurocircuitry of the extended amygdala. The craving and deficits in executive function in the so-called preoccupation/anticipation stage involve the dysregulation of key afferent projections from the prefrontal cortex and insula,  including glutamate, to the basal ganglia and extended amygdala. Molecular genetic studies have identified transduction and transcription factors that act in neurocircuitry associated with the development and maintenance of addiction that might mediate initial vulnerability, maintenance, and relapse associated with addiction.", "27209241": "BACKGROUND: Excitatory synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a  key biological substrate underlying behavioral responses to psychostimulants and  susceptibility to relapse. Studies have demonstrated that cocaine induces changes in glutamatergic signaling at distinct inputs to the NAc. However, consequences of cocaine experience on synaptic transmission from the midline nuclei of the thalamus (mThal) to the NAc have yet to be reported. METHODS: To examine synapses from specific NAc core inputs, we recorded light-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents following viral-mediated expression of channelrhodopsin-2 in the mThal, prefrontal cortex (PFC), or basolateral amygdala from acute brain slices. To identify NAc medium spiny neuron subtypes, we used mice expressing tdTomato driven by the promoter for dopamine receptor subtype 1 (D1). We recorded N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) properties to evaluate synaptic adaptations induced by cocaine experience, a 5-day cocaine exposure followed by 2 weeks of abstinence. RESULTS: Excitatory inputs to the NAc core displayed differential NMDAR properties, and cocaine experience uniquely altered AMPAR and NMDAR properties at mThal-D1(+), mThal-D1(-), and PFC-D1(+) synapses, but not at PFC-D1(-) synapses.  Finally, at mThal-D1(+) synapses, cocaine enhanced GluN2C/D function and NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify contrasting cocaine-induced AMPAR and NMDAR modifications at mThal-NAc and PFC-NAc core synapses. These changes include an enhancement of NMDAR function and plasticity at mThal-D1(+) synapses. Incorporation of GluN2C/D-containing NMDARs most likely underlies these phenomena and represents a potential therapeutic target for psychostimulant use disorders.", "27181061": "Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) form inhibitory synapses on neighboring striatal neurons through axon collaterals. The functional relevance of this lateral inhibition and its regulation by dopamine remains elusive. We show that synchronized stimulation of collateral transmission from multiple indirect-pathway MSNs (iMSNs) potently inhibits action potentials in direct-pathway MSNs (dMSNs) in the nucleus accumbens. Dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs) suppress lateral inhibition from iMSNs to disinhibit dMSNs, which are known to facilitate locomotion. Surprisingly, D2R inhibition of synaptic transmission was larger at axon collaterals from iMSNs than their projections to  the ventral pallidum. Targeted deletion of D2Rs from iMSNs impaired cocaine's ability to suppress lateral inhibition and increase locomotion. These impairments were rescued by chemogenetic activation of Gi-signaling in iMSNs. These findings  shed light on the functional significance of lateral inhibition between MSNs and  offer a novel synaptic mechanism by which dopamine gates locomotion and cocaine exerts its canonical stimulant response.

In 1995, the properties of these interneurons were completely unknown. Twenty years later, thanks to the massive use of subcellular patch-clamp techniques, simultaneous multiple-cell recording, optogenetics, in vivo measurements, and computational approaches, our knowledge about PV(+) interneurons became more extensive than for several types of pyramidal neurons. These findings have implications beyond the \"small world\" of basic research on GABAergic cells. For example, the results provide a first proof of principle that neuroscientists might be able to close the gaps between the molecular, cellular,  network, and behavioral levels, representing one of the main challenges at the present time. Furthermore, the results may form the basis for PV(+) interneurons  as therapeutic targets for brain disease in the future. However, much needs to be learned about the basic function of these interneurons before clinical neuroscientists will be able to use PV(+) interneurons for therapeutic purposes.", "24995986": "In humans, neuroligin-3 mutations are associated with autism, whereas in mice, the corresponding mutations produce robust synaptic and behavioral changes. However, different neuroligin-3 mutations cause largely distinct phenotypes in mice, and no causal relationship links a specific synaptic dysfunction to a behavioral change. Using rotarod motor learning as a proxy for acquired repetitive behaviors in mice, we found that different neuroligin-3 mutations uniformly enhanced formation of repetitive motor routines. Surprisingly, neuroligin-3 mutations caused this phenotype not via changes in the cerebellum or dorsal striatum but via a selective synaptic impairment in the nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum. Here, neuroligin-3 mutations increased rotarod learning by specifically impeding synaptic inhibition onto D1-dopamine receptor-expressing but not D2-dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons. Our data thus suggest that different autism-associated neuroligin-3 mutations cause a common increase in acquired repetitive behaviors by impairing a specific  striatal synapse and thereby provide a plausible circuit substrate for autism pathophysiology.", "24848058": "Nucleus accumbens neurons serve to integrate information from cortical and limbic regions to direct behaviour. Addictive drugs are proposed to hijack this system,  enabling drug-associated cues to trigger relapse to drug seeking. However, the connections affected and proof of causality remain to be established. Here we use a mouse model of delayed cue-associated cocaine seeking with ex vivo electrophysiology in optogenetically delineated circuits. We find that seeking correlates with rectifying AMPA (\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor transmission and a reduced AMPA/NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) ratio  at medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to nucleus accumbens shell D1-receptor medium-sized spiny neurons (D1R-MSNs). In contrast, the AMPA/NMDA ratio increases at ventral hippocampus to D1R-MSNs. Optogenetic reversal of cocaine-evoked plasticity at both inputs abolishes seeking, whereas selective reversal at mPFC or ventral hippocampus synapses impairs response discrimination or reduces response vigour during seeking, respectively. Taken together, we describe how information integration in the nucleus accumbens is commandeered by cocaine at discrete synapses to allow relapse. Our approach holds promise for identifying synaptic causalities in other behavioural disorders.", "24843012": "Synaptic transmission between midbrain dopamine neurons and target neurons in the striatum is essential for the selection and reinforcement of movements. Recent evidence indicates that nigrostriatal dopamine neurons inhibit striatal projection neurons by releasing a neurotransmitter that activates GABAA receptors. Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenon extends to mesolimbic afferents, and confirm that the released neurotransmitter is GABA. However, the GABA synthetic enzymes GAD65 and GAD67 are not detected in midbrain dopamine neurons. Instead, these cells express the membrane GABA transporters mGAT1 (Slc6a1) and mGAT4 (Slc6a11) and inhibition of these transporters prevents GABA co-release. These findings therefore indicate that GABA co-release is a general feature of midbrain dopaminergic neurons that relies on GABA uptake from the extracellular milieu as opposed to de novo synthesis. This atypical mechanism may confer dopaminergic neurons the flexibility to differentially control GABAergic transmission in a target-dependent manner across their extensive axonal arbors.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01936.001.", "23892554": "The dorsolateral striatum and cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) signaling mediate habitual action learning, which is thought to require a balance of activity in the direct and indirect striatal output pathways. However, very little is known about how the high CB1-expressing striatal inhibitory microcircuitry might contribute to long-term plasticity capable of sculpting direct and indirect pathway output. Using optogenetic and molecular interrogation of striatal GABAergic microcircuits, we examined voltage-dependent long-term depression of inhibitory synapses (iLTD) onto mouse and rat medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs). The observed iLTD involved recruitment of different endocannabinoid types and showed both presynaptic and postsynaptic selectivity for MSN subtypes, ultimately resulting in a powerful disinhibition of direct pathway MSNs. These results suggest a new role for voltage states in gating circuit-specific forms of synaptic plasticity and illuminate possible circuit dynamics underlying action control.", "23012412": "Endocannabinoid signaling critically regulates emotional and motivational states  via activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) in the brain. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) functions to gate emotional and motivational responses. Although  expression of CB1 in the NAc is low, manipulation of CB1 signaling within the NAc triggers robust emotional/motivational alterations related to drug addiction and  other psychiatric disorders, and these effects cannot be exclusively attributed to CB1 located at afferents to the NAc. Rather, CB1-expressing neurons in the NAc, although sparse, appear to be critical for emotional and motivational responses. However, the cellular properties of these neurons remain largely unknown. Here, we generated a knock-in mouse line in which CB1-expressing neurons expressed the fluorescent protein td-Tomato (tdT). Using these mice, we demonstrated that tdT-positive neurons within the NAc were exclusively fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs). These FSIs were electrically coupled with each  other, and thus may help synchronize populations/ensembles of NAc neurons. CB1-expressing FSIs also form GABAergic synapses on adjacent medium spiny neurons (MSNs), providing feed-forward inhibition of NAc output. Furthermore, the membrane excitability of tdT-positive FSIs in the NAc was up-regulated after withdrawal from cocaine exposure, an effect that might increase FSI-to-MSN inhibition. Taken together with our previous findings that the membrane excitability of NAc MSNs is decreased during cocaine withdrawal, the present findings suggest that the basal functional output of the NAc is inhibited during  cocaine withdrawal by multiple mechanisms. As such, CB1-expressing FSIs are targeted by cocaine exposure to influence the overall functional output of the NAc.", "21338877": "Addictive drugs have in common that they target the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system. This system originates in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projects mainly to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we review the effects that such drugs leave on glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission in these three brain areas. We refer to these changes as drug-evoked synaptic plasticity, which outlasts the presence of the drug in the brain and contributes to the reorganization of neural circuits. While in most cases these early changes are not sufficient to induce the disease, with repetitive drug exposure, they may add up and contribute to addictive behavior.", "19571793": "Addiction is associated with neuroplasticity in the corticostriatal brain circuitry that is important for guiding adaptive behaviour. The hierarchy of corticostriatal information processing that normally permits the prefrontal cortex to regulate reinforcement-seeking behaviours is impaired by chronic drug use. A failure of the prefrontal cortex to control drug-seeking behaviours can be linked to an enduring imbalance between synaptic and non-synaptic glutamate, termed glutamate homeostasis. The imbalance in glutamate homeostasis engenders changes in neuroplasticity that impair communication between the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens. Some of these pathological changes are amenable to new glutamate- and neuroplasticity-based pharmacotherapies for treating addiction.", "14684448": "Addictive drugs are thought to alter normal brain function and cause the remodeling of synaptic functions in areas important to memory and reward. Excitatory transmission to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is involved in the actions of most drugs of abuse, including cannabis. We have explored the functions of the endocannabinoid system at the prefrontal cortex-NAc synapses. Immunocytochemistry showed cannabinoid receptor (CB1) expression on axonal terminals making contacts  with NAc neurons. In NAc slices, synthetic cannabinoids inhibit spontaneous and evoked glutamate-mediated transmission through presynaptic activation of presynaptic K+ channels and GABA-mediated transmission most likely via a direct presynaptic action on the vesicular release machinery. How does synaptic activity lead to the production of endogenous cannabinoids (eCBs) in the NAc? More generally, do eCBs participate in long-term synaptic plasticity in the brain? We  found that tetanic stimulation (mimicking naturally occurring frequencies) of prelimbic glutamatergic afferents induced a presynaptic LTD dependent on eCB and  CB1 receptors (eCB-LTD). Induction of eCB-LTD required postsynaptic activation of mGlu5 receptors and a rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ from ryanodine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores. This retrograde signaling cascade involved postsynaptic eCB release and activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors. In the NAc, eCB-LTD might be part of a negative feedback loop, reducing glutamatergic synaptic strength during sustained cortical activity. The fact that this new form of LTD was occluded by an exogenous cannabinoid suggested that cannabis derivatives, such as marijuana, may alter normal eCB-mediated synaptic plasticity. These data suggest a major role of the eCB system in long-term synaptic plasticity and give insights into how cannabis derivatives, such as marijuana, alter normal eCB functions in the brain reward system.", "24232172": "Addictive drug use causes long-lasting changes in synaptic strength and dendritic spine morphology in the nucleus accumbens that might underlie the vulnerability to relapse. Although activity in mesocorticolimbic circuitry is required for reinstating cocaine seeking, its role in reinstatement-associated synaptic plasticity is not well characterized. Using rats extinguished from cocaine self-administration, we found potentiated synaptic strength (assessed as the AMPA/NMDA current amplitude ratio) and increased spine head diameter in medium spiny neurons in the accumbens core (NAcore). The basal changes in synaptic strength and morphology in cocaine-extinguished animals were further augmented during cocaine-induced reinstatement. Two NAcore afferents contributing to cocaine reinstatement are glutamatergic inputs from the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) and dopamine from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Pharmacological inhibition of either PL or VTA prevented cocaine-primed reinstatement. However, inhibiting the PL further potentiated AMPA/NMDA and spine head diameter, while inactivating the VTA or the combined systemic administration of dopamine D1 and D2 antagonists prevented the increase in AMPA/NMDA and spine diameter induced by  cocaine priming. These data indicate that neuronal activity in the VTA and associated dopamine receptor stimulation is necessary for the synaptic potentiation in the NAcore during cocaine-induced reinstatement. Although activity in the PL was necessary for reinstatement, it inhibited synaptic potentiation initiated by an acute cocaine injection. Thus, although the PL and VTA differentially regulate the direction of synaptic plasticity induced by a cocaine-priming injection, coordinated synaptic potentiation by both NAcore afferents is necessary for cocaine-induced relapse.", "23428656": "Cocaine exposure causes enduring neuroadaptations in ventral striatum, or nucleus accumbens (NAc), an area critically involved in reward learning and relapse of drug seeking. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in striatum are dichotomous in their expression of either D1 or D2 dopamine receptors, along with other receptors and  neuropeptides. In dorsal striatum, these two subpopulations show non-overlapping  innervation of distinct terminal fields via the direct or indirect pathways. However, NAc D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs are not fully segregated in this manner, with both cell types innervating ventral pallidum. Recent studies show that D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs play opposing roles in cocaine-associated behaviors. Further, cocaine induces differential adaptations in these two subpopulations in NAc, including changes to synaptic plasticity, glutamatergic signaling, and spine morphology.", "23352169": "Drug addiction is driven, in part, by powerful drug-related memories. Deficits in social life, particularly during adolescence, increase addiction vulnerability. Social isolation in rodents has been used extensively to model the effects of deficient social experience, yet its impact on learning and memory processes underlying addiction remains elusive. Here, we show that social isolation of rats during a critical period of adolescence (postnatal days 21-42) enhances long-term potentiation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated glutamatergic transmission in the  ventral tegmental area (VTA). This enhancement, which is caused by an increase in metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent Ca(2+) signaling, cannot be reversed by subsequent resocialization. Notably, memories of amphetamine- and ethanol-paired  contextual stimuli are acquired faster and, once acquired, amphetamine-associated contextual memory is more resistant to extinction in socially isolated rats. We propose that NMDAR plasticity in the VTA may represent a neural substrate by which early life deficits in social experience increase addiction vulnerability.", "21490129": "Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse enhances the motor-stimulant response to these drugs, a phenomenon termed behavioral sensitization. Animals that are extinguished from self-administration training readily relapse to drug, conditioned cue, or stress priming. The involvement of sensitization in reinstated drug-seeking behavior remains controversial. This review describes sensitization and reinstated drug seeking as behavioral events, and the neural circuitry, neurochemistry, and neuropharmacology underlying both behavioral models will be described, compared, and contrasted. It seems that although sensitization and reinstatement involve overlapping circuitry and neurotransmitter and receptor systems, the role of sensitization in reinstatement remains ill-defined. Nevertheless, it is argued that sensitization remains a useful model for determining the neural basis of addiction, and an example is provided in which data from sensitization studies led to potential pharmacotherapies that have been tested in animal models of relapse and in human  addicts.", "19710631": "Drug addiction is a chronically relapsing disorder that has been characterized by (1) compulsion to seek and take the drug, (2) loss of control in limiting intake, and (3) emergence of a negative emotional state (eg, dysphoria, anxiety, irritability) reflecting a motivational withdrawal syndrome when access to the drug is prevented. Drug addiction has been conceptualized as a disorder that involves elements of both impulsivity and compulsivity that yield a composite addiction cycle composed of three stages: 'binge/intoxication', 'withdrawal/negative affect', and 'preoccupation/anticipation' (craving). Animal  and human imaging studies have revealed discrete circuits that mediate the three  stages of the addiction cycle with key elements of the ventral tegmental area and ventral striatum as a focal point for the binge/intoxication stage, a key role for the extended amygdala in the withdrawal/negative affect stage, and a key role in the preoccupation/anticipation stage for a widely distributed network involving the orbitofrontal cortex-dorsal striatum, prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, hippocampus, and insula involved in craving and the cingulate gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal, and inferior frontal cortices in disrupted inhibitory control. The transition to addiction involves neuroplasticity in all of these structures that may begin with changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system and a cascade of neuroadaptations from the ventral striatum to dorsal striatum and orbitofrontal cortex and eventually dysregulation of the prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and extended amygdala.

The present report compares and contrasts projections from the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) cortices in the rat by using the anterograde anatomical tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. With the exception of common projections to parts of the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex, olfactory forebrain, and midline thalamus, PL and IL distribute very differently throughout the brain. Main projection sites of IL are: 1) the lateral septum, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, medial and lateral preoptic nuclei, substantia innominata, and endopiriform nuclei of the basal forebrain; 2) the medial, basomedial, central, and cortical nuclei of amygdala; 3) the dorsomedial, lateral, perifornical, posterior, and supramammillary nuclei of hypothalamus; and 4) the parabrachial and solitary nuclei of the brainstem. By contrast, PL projects at best sparingly to each of these structures. Main projection sites of  PL are: the agranular insular cortex, claustrum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, the paraventricular, mediodorsal, and reuniens nuclei of thalamus, the  capsular part of the central nucleus and the basolateral nucleus of amygdala, and the dorsal and median raphe nuclei of the brainstem. As discussed herein, the pattern of IL projections is consistent with a role for IL in the control of visceral/autonomic activity homologous to the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex of primates, whereas those of PL are consistent with a role for PL in limbic-cognitive functions homologous to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of primates.", "26858215": "BACKGROUND: Previous work has shown that chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) induces increased phasic firing of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) selectively in mice that are  susceptible to the deleterious effects of the stress. In addition, acute optogenetic phasic stimulation of these neurons promotes susceptibility in animals exposed to acute defeat stress. These findings are paradoxical, as increased DA signaling in NAc normally promotes motivation and reward, and the influence of chronic phasic VTA firing in the face of chronic stress is unknown. METHODS: We used CSDS with repeated optogenetic activation and pharmacologic manipulations of the mesolimbic VTA-NAc pathway to examine the role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and DA signaling in depressive-like behaviors. We measured BDNF protein expression and DA release in this model. RESULTS: Pharmacologic blockade of BDNF-tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling, but not DA signaling, in NAc prevented CSDS-induced behavioral abnormalities. Chronic optogenetic phasic stimulation of the VTA-NAc circuit during CSDS exacerbated the defeat-induced behavioral symptoms, and these aggravated symptoms were also normalized by BDNF-TrkB blockade in NAc. The aggravated behavioral deficits induced by phasic stimulation of the VTA-NAc pathway were blocked as well by local knockdown of BDNF in VTA. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that BDNF-TrkB signaling, rather than DA signaling, in the VTA-NAc circuit is crucial for facilitating depressive-like outcomes after CSDS and they establish BDNF-TrkB signaling as a pathologic mechanism during periods of chronic stress.", "24025838": "Social behaviours in species as diverse as honey bees and humans promote group survival but often come at some cost to the individual. Although reinforcement of adaptive social interactions is ostensibly required for the evolutionary persistence of these behaviours, the neural mechanisms by which social reward is  encoded by the brain are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that in mice oxytocin acts as a social reinforcement signal within the nucleus accumbens core, where it elicits a presynaptically expressed long-term depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in medium spiny neurons. Although the nucleus accumbens receives oxytocin-receptor-containing inputs from several brain regions, genetic  deletion of these receptors specifically from dorsal raphe nucleus, which provides serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) innervation to the nucleus accumbens, abolishes the reinforcing properties of social interaction. Furthermore, oxytocin-induced synaptic plasticity requires activation of nucleus  accumbens 5-HT1B receptors, the blockade of which prevents social reward. These results demonstrate that the rewarding properties of social interaction in mice require the coordinated activity of oxytocin and 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens, a mechanistic insight with implications for understanding the pathogenesis of social dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism.", "23136424": "Uncontrolled consumption of alcohol is a hallmark of alcohol abuse disorders; however, the central molecular mechanisms underlying excessive alcohol consumption are still unclear. Here, we report that the GTP binding protein, H-Ras in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a key role in neuroadaptations that underlie excessive alcohol-drinking behaviors. Specifically, acute (15 min) systemic administration of alcohol (2.5 g/kg) leads to the activation of H-Ras in the NAc of mice, which is observed even 24 h later. Similarly, rat operant self-administration of alcohol (20%) also results in the activation of H-Ras in the NAc. Using the same procedures, we provide evidence suggesting that the exchange factor GRF1 is upstream of H-Ras activation by alcohol. Importantly, we  show that infection of mice NAc with lentivirus expressing a short hairpin RNA that targets the H-Ras gene produces a significant reduction of voluntary consumption of 20% alcohol. In contrast, knockdown of H-Ras in the NAc of mice did not alter water, quinine, and saccharin intake. Furthermore, using two-bottle choice and operant self-administration procedures, we show that inhibiting H-Ras  activity by intra-NAc infusion of the farnesyltransferase inhibitor, FTI-276, produced a robust decrease of rats' alcohol drinking; however, sucrose consumption was unaltered. Finally, intra-NAc infusion of FTI-276 also resulted in an attenuation of seeking for alcohol. Together, these results position H-Ras  as a central molecular mediator of alcohol's actions within the mesolimbic system and put forward the potential value of the enzyme as a novel target to treat alcohol use disorders.", "22689792": "Direct and indirect pathway striatal neurons are known to exert opposing control  over motor output.

As the behavioral effects of drugs of abuse are long-lasting, identifying persistent changes in striatal circuits induced by in vivo drug experience is of  considerable importance. Within the striatum, drugs of abuse have been shown to induce modifications in dendritic morphology, ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluR) and the induction of synaptic plasticity.

Acute exposure to EtOH activates or inhibits the function of proteins involved in synaptic transmission, while chronic exposure often produces opposing and/or compensatory/homeostatic effects on the expression, localization, and function of these proteins. Interactions between different neurotransmitters (e.g., neuropeptide effects on release of small molecule transmitters) can also influence both acute and chronic EtOH actions. Studies in intact animals indicate that the proteins affected by EtOH also play roles in the neural actions of the drug, including acute intoxication, tolerance, dependence, and the seeking and drinking of EtOH.

This midbrain region receives its own complex mix  of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, some of which have only recently been identified. Such afferent regulation positions the dopamine system to bias goal-directed behavior based on internal drives and environmental contingencies.  Conditions that result in reward promote phasic dopamine release, which serves to maintain ongoing behavior by selectively potentiating ventral subicular drive to  the accumbens. Behaviors that fail to produce an expected reward decrease dopamine transmission, which favors prefrontal cortical-driven switching to new behavioral strategies. As such, the limbic reward system is designed to optimize  action plans for maximizing reward outcomes. This system can be commandeered by drugs of abuse or psychiatric disorders, resulting in inappropriate behaviors that sustain failed reward strategies. A fuller appreciation of the circuitry interconnecting the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area should serve to  advance discovery of new treatment options for these conditions.", "18647613": "Drugs of abuse produce widespread effects on the structure and function of neurons throughout the brain's reward circuitry, and these changes are believed to underlie the long-lasting behavioral phenotypes that characterize addiction. Although the intracellular mechanisms regulating the structural plasticity of neurons are not fully understood, accumulating evidence suggests an essential role for neurotrophic factor signaling in the neuronal remodeling which occurs after chronic drug administration. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor enriched in brain and highly regulated by several drugs of abuse, regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma), and nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) signaling pathways, which influence a range of cellular functions including neuronal survival, growth, differentiation, and structure. This review  discusses recent advances in our understanding of how BDNF and its signaling pathways regulate structural and behavioral plasticity in the context of drug addiction.", "17108154": "Long-term depression (LTD) at the corticostriatal synapse is postsynaptically induced but presynaptically expressed, the depression being a result of retrograde endocannabinoid signaling that activates presynaptic cannabinoid CB1 receptors and reduces the probability of glutamate release. To study the role of  protein synthesis in striatal LTD, we used a striatum-only preparation in which the presynaptic cell body is cut off, leaving intact only its axons, whose terminals synapse on medium spiny neurons. LTD (duration >150 min) was induced in this preparation, thus providing evidence that transcription in the presynaptic cell nucleus is not necessary for this form of plasticity. The maintenance of striatal LTD, however, was blocked by bath application of protein translation inhibitors but not by the same inhibitors loaded into the postsynaptic cell. These results suggest that local translation is critical for the expression of striatal LTD, distinguishing this form of mammalian synaptic plasticity from other forms that require postsynaptic protein synthesis. Possible roles of axonal or glial translation in striatal LTD are considered.", "15504328": "Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in vivo undergo large membrane depolarizations known as state transitions. Calcium (Ca) entry into MSNs triggers diverse downstream cellular processes. However, little is known about Ca signals  in MSN dendrites and spines and how state transitions influence these signals. Here, we develop a novel approach, combining 2-photon Ca imaging and 2-photon glutamate uncaging, to examine how voltage-sensitive Ca channels (VSCCs) and ionotropic glutamate receptors contribute to Ca signals in MSNs. We find that upstate transitions switch the VSCCs available in dendrites and spines, decreasing T-type while enhancing L-type channels. Moreover, these transitions change the dominant synaptic Ca source from Ca-permeable AMPA receptors to NMDA receptors. Finally, pairing bAPs with synaptic inputs generates additional synaptic Ca signals due to enhanced Ca influx through NMDA receptors. By altering the sources, amplitude, and kinetics of spine Ca signals, state transitions may gate synaptic plasticity and gene expression in MSNs.", "8601819": "In vivo intracellular recordings of spontaneous activity of neostriatal spiny cells revealed two-state behavior, i.e., characteristic shifts of membrane potential between two preferred levels. The more polarized level, called the Down state, varied among neurons from -61 to -94 mV. The more depolarized level, called the Up state, varied among neurons form -71 to -40 mV. For any one neuron, the membrane potential in the Up and Down states was constant over the period of  observation (from 15 min to 4 hr), and the cells spent little time in transition  between states. The level of membrane potential noise was higher in the Up state  than in the Down state. Spontaneous membrane potential fluctuations were not abolished by experimental alteration of the membrane potential, but the time spent in each state was altered when intracellular current was used to vary the baseline membrane potential. Neither the sodium nor the calcium action potential  that could be evoked by depolarization of spiny neurons was required for the occurrence of spontaneous shifts of membrane potential. Blockade of these action  potentials using intracellular injection of QX314 and D890, respectively, altered neither the incidence of the membrane potential shifts nor the preferred membrane potential in either state. In contrast, antagonism of voltage-dependent potassium channels with intracellular cesium altered membrane potential shifts. In the presence of QX314 and D890, intracellular injection of cesium caused little or no change in the Down state and a large depolarizing shift in the Up state (to about -20 mV). Under these circumstances, the neuron responded to current in a nearly linear manner, and membrane conductance was found to be increased in the Up state, attributable to a membrane conductance with the same reversal potential as that of the synaptic potential evoked by cortical stimulation. These results indicate that the event underlying the Up state is a maintained barrage of synaptic excitation, but that the membrane potential achieved during the Up state in neostriatal spiny neurons is determined by dendritic potassium channels that clamp the membrane potential at a level determined by their voltage sensitivity.  Neostriatal spiny neurons ordinarily receive enormously powerful excitation, which would drive the cells to saturation, and probably destroy them, if it were  not for these potassium currents.", "29307710": "Mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons play a central role in motivation and reward processing. Although the activity of these mesolimbic DA neurons is controlled by afferent inputs, little is known about the circuits in which they are embedded. Using retrograde tracing, electrophysiology, optogenetics, and behavioral assays, we identify principles of afferent-specific control in the mesolimbic DA system.  Neurons in the medial shell subdivision of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) exert direct inhibitory control over two separate populations of mesolimbic DA neurons  by activating different GABA receptor subtypes. In contrast, NAc lateral shell neurons mainly synapse onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) GABA neurons, resulting  in disinhibition of DA neurons that project back to the NAc lateral shell. Lastly, we establish a critical role for NAc subregion-specific input to the VTA  underlying motivated behavior. Collectively, our results suggest a distinction in the incorporation of inhibitory inputs between different subtypes of mesolimbic DA neurons.", "27667004": "Addiction is a disorder of behavioral symptoms including enhanced incentive salience of drug-associated cues, but also a negative affective state. Cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity in the reward system, particularly the nucleus accumbens (NAc), drives drug-adaptive behavior. However, how information is integrated downstream of the NAc remains unclear. Here, we identify the ventral pallidum (VP) as a site of convergence of medium spiny neurons expressing dopamine (DA) receptor type 1 (D1-MSNs) and type 2 (D2-MSNs) of the NAc. Repeated in\u00a0vivo cocaine exposure potentiated output of D1-MSNs, but weakened output of D2-MSNs, occluding LTP and LTD at these synapses, respectively. Selectively restoring basal transmission at D1-MSN-to-VP synapses abolished locomotor sensitization, whereas restoring transmission at D2-MSN-to-VP synapses normalized motivational deficits. Our results support a model by which drug-evoked synaptic  plasticity in the VP mediates opposing behavioral symptoms; targeting the VP may  provide novel therapeutic strategies for addictive disorders.", "27264310": "BACKGROUND: The incubation of cue-induced drug craving in rodents provides a model of persistent vulnerability to craving and relapse in human addicts. After  prolonged withdrawal, incubated cocaine craving depends on strengthening of nucleus accumbens (NAc) core synapses through incorporation of Ca2+-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (CP-AMPARs).  Through metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1)-mediated synaptic depression,  mGluR1 positive allosteric modulators remove CP-AMPARs from these synapses and thereby reduce cocaine craving. This study aimed to determine if similar plasticity accompanies incubation of methamphetamine craving. METHODS: Rats self-administered saline or methamphetamine under extended-access conditions. Cue-induced seeking tests demonstrated incubation of methamphetamine  craving. After withdrawal periods ranging from 1 to >40 days, rats underwent one  of the following procedures: 1) whole-cell patch clamp recordings to characterize AMPAR transmission, 2) intra-NAc core injection of the CP-AMPAR antagonist 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine followed by a seeking test, or 3) systemic administration of a mGluR1 positive allosteric modulator followed by a seeking test. RESULTS: Incubation of methamphetamine craving was associated with CP-AMPAR accumulation in NAc core, and both effects were maximal after ~1 week of withdrawal. Expression of incubated craving was decreased by intra-NAc core 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine injection or systemic mGluR1 positive allosteric modulator administration. CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first to demonstrate a role for the NAc in the incubation of methamphetamine craving and describe adaptations in synaptic transmission associated with this model. They establish that incubation of craving and associated CP-AMPAR plasticity occur much more rapidly during withdrawal from methamphetamine compared with cocaine. However, a common mGluR1-based therapeutic strategy may be helpful for recovering cocaine and methamphetamine addicts.", "27145911": "Addiction is a disease of altered behavior. Addicts use drugs compulsively and will continue to do so despite negative consequences. Even after prolonged periods of abstinence, addicts are at risk of relapse, particularly when cues evoke memories that are associated with drug use. Rodent models mimic many of the core components of addiction, from the initial drug reinforcement to cue-associated relapse and continued drug intake despite negative consequences. Rodent models have also enabled unprecedented mechanistic insight into addiction, revealing plasticity of glutamatergic synaptic transmission evoked by the strong  activation of mesolimbic dopamine-a defining feature of all addictive drugs-as a  neural substrate for these drug-adaptive behaviors. Cell type-specific optogenetic manipulations have allowed both identification of the relevant circuits and design of protocols to reverse drug-evoked plasticity and to establish links of causality with drug-adaptive behaviors. The emergence of a circuit model for addiction will open the door for novel therapies, such as deep  brain stimulation.", "26831103": "The reinforcing and rewarding properties of cocaine are attributed to its ability to increase dopaminergic transmission in nucleus accumbens (NAc). This action reinforces drug taking and seeking and leads to potent and long-lasting associations between the rewarding effects of the drug and the cues associated with its availability. The inability to extinguish these associations is a key factor contributing to relapse. Dopamine produces these effects by controlling the activity of two subpopulations of NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that are defined by their predominant expression of either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors. Previous work has demonstrated that optogenetically stimulating D1 MSNs promotes  reward, whereas stimulating D2 MSNs produces aversion. However, we still lack a clear understanding of how the endogenous activity of these cell types is affected by cocaine and encodes information that drives drug-associated behaviors. Using fiber photometry calcium imaging we define D1 MSNs as the specific population of cells in NAc that encodes information about drug associations and elucidate the temporal profile with which D1 activity is increased to drive drug seeking in response to contextual cues. Chronic cocaine exposure dysregulates these D1 signals to both prevent extinction and facilitate  reinstatement of drug seeking to drive relapse. Directly manipulating these D1 signals using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs prevents contextual associations. Together, these data elucidate the responses of D1- and  D2-type MSNs in NAc to acute cocaine and during the formation of context-reward associations and define how prior cocaine exposure selectively dysregulates D1 signaling to drive relapse.", "25108911": "Repeated exposure to cocaine alters the structural and functional properties of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These changes suggest a rewiring of the NAc circuit, with an enhancement of excitatory synaptic connections onto MSNs. However, it is unknown how drug exposure alters the balance of long-range afferents onto different cell types in the NAc. Here we used whole-cell recordings, two-photon microscopy, optogenetics and pharmacogenetics to show how repeated cocaine exposure alters connectivity in the mouse NAc medial shell. Cocaine selectively enhanced amygdala innervation of MSNs expressing D1 dopamine receptors (D1-MSNs) relative to D2-MSNs. We also found that amygdala activity was required for cocaine-induced changes to behavior and connectivity. Finally, we established how heightened amygdala innervation can explain the structural and functional changes evoked by cocaine. Our findings reveal how exposure to drugs of abuse fundamentally reorganizes cell type- and input-specific connectivity in the NAc.", "24584054": "The ventral pallidum is centrally positioned within mesocorticolimbic reward circuits, and its dense projection to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) regulates  neuronal activity there. However, the ventral pallidum is a heterogeneous structure, and how this complexity affects its role within wider reward circuits  is unclear. We found that projections to VTA from the rostral ventral pallidum (RVP), but not the caudal ventral pallidum (CVP), were robustly Fos activated during cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking--a rat model of relapse in addiction. Moreover, designer receptor-mediated transient inactivation of RVP neurons, their terminals in VTA or functional connectivity between RVP and VTA dopamine neurons blocked the ability of drug-associated cues (but not a cocaine prime) to reinstate cocaine seeking. In contrast, CVP neuronal inhibition blocked cocaine-primed, but not cue-induced, reinstatement. This double dissociation in ventral pallidum subregional roles in drug seeking is likely to be important for  understanding the mesocorticolimbic circuits underlying reward seeking and addiction.", "24077564": "In rat models of drug relapse and craving, cue-induced cocaine seeking progressively increases after withdrawal from the drug. This 'incubation of cocaine craving' is partially mediated by time-dependent adaptations at glutamatergic synapses in nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the circuit-level adaptations mediating this plasticity remain elusive. We studied silent synapses, often regarded as immature synapses that express stable NMDA receptors with AMPA  receptors being either absent or labile, in the projection from the basolateral amygdala to the NAc in incubation of cocaine craving. Silent synapses were detected in this projection during early withdrawal from cocaine. As the withdrawal period progressed, these silent synapses became unsilenced, a process  that involved synaptic insertion of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs). In vivo optogenetic stimulation-induced downregulation of CP-AMPARs at amygdala-to-NAc synapses, which re-silenced some of the previously silent synapses after prolonged withdrawal, decreased incubation of cocaine craving. Our findings indicate that silent synapse-based reorganization of the amygdala-to-NAc projection is critical for persistent cocaine craving and relapse after withdrawal.", "24072923": "Drug-evoked synaptic plasticity in the mesolimbic system reshapes circuit function and drives drug-adaptive behavior. Much research has focused on excitatory transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). How drug-evoked synaptic plasticity of inhibitory transmission affects circuit adaptations remains unknown. We found that medium spiny neurons expressing dopamine (DA) receptor type 1 (D1R-MSNs) of the NAc project to the VTA, strongly preferring the GABA neurons of the VTA. Repeated in vivo exposure to cocaine evoked synaptic potentiation at this synapse, occluding homosynaptic inhibitory long-term potentiation. The activity of the VTA GABA neurons was thus  reduced and DA neurons were disinhibited. Cocaine-evoked potentiation of GABA release from D1R-MSNs affected drug-adaptive behavior, which identifies these neurons as a promising target for novel addiction treatments.", "23542690": "A hallmark of addiction is the loss of control over drug intake, which is seen in only a fraction of those exposed to stimulant drugs such as cocaine. The cellular mechanisms underlying vulnerability or resistance to compulsive drug use remain unknown. We found that individual variability in the development of highly motivated and perseverative behavior toward cocaine is associated with synaptic plasticity in medium spiny neurons expressing dopamine D2 receptors (D2-MSNs) in  the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice. Potentiation of glutamatergic inputs onto indirect pathway D2-MSNs was associated with resilience toward compulsive cocaine seeking. Inhibition of D2-MSNs using a chemicogenetic approach enhanced the motivation to obtain cocaine, whereas optogenetic activation of D2-MSNs suppressed cocaine self-administration. These results indicate that recruitment of D2-MSNs in NAc functions to restrain cocaine self-administration and serves as a natural protective mechanism in drug-exposed individuals.", "23319622": "Synaptic modifications in nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons (MSNs) play a key role in adaptive and pathological reward-dependent learning, including maladaptive responses involved in drug addiction. NAc MSNs participate in two parallel circuits, direct and indirect pathways that subserve distinct behavioral functions. Modification of NAc MSN synapses may occur in part via changes in the  transcriptional potential of certain genes in a cell type\u2013specific manner. The transcription factor \u2206FosB is one of the key proteins implicated in the gene expression changes in NAc caused by drugs of abuse, yet its effects on synaptic function in NAc MSNs are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of \u2206FosB decreased excitatory synaptic strength and likely increased silent synapses onto D1 dopamine receptor\u2013expressing direct pathway MSNs in both the NAc shell and core. In contrast, \u2206FosB likely decreased silent synapses onto NAc shell, but not core, D2 dopamine receptor\u2013expressing indirect pathway MSNs. Analysis of NAc  MSN dendritic spine morphology revealed that \u2206FosB increased the density of immature spines in D1 direct but not D2 indirect pathway MSNs. To determine the behavioral consequences of cell type-specific actions of \u2206FosB, we selectively overexpressed \u2206FosB in D1 direct or D2 indirect MSNs in NAc in vivo and found that direct (but not indirect) pathway MSN expression enhances behavioral responses to cocaine. These results reveal that \u2206FosB in NAc differentially modulates synaptic properties and reward-related behaviors in a cell type- and subregion-specific fashion.", "23143514": "We found that medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in both the direct and indirect pathways of the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) receive inputs from the cortex, thalamus and hippocampus. However, hippocampal inputs were much weaker onto indirect MSNs, where they contacted small spines located in the distal dendrites. This selective targeting means that these inputs must be gated by subthreshold depolarization to trigger action potentials and influence NAc output.", "22593064": "Numerous studies have found that chronic cocaine increases dendritic spine density of medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Here, we used single-cell microinjections and advanced 3D imaging and analysis techniques to extend these findings in several important ways: by assessing cocaine regulation  of dendritic spines in the core versus shell subregions of NAc in the mouse, over a broad time course (4 h, 24 h, or 28 d) of withdrawal from chronic cocaine, and  with a particular focus on proximal versus distal dendrites. Our data demonstrate subregion-specific, and in some cases opposite, regulation of spines by cocaine on proximal but not distal dendrites. Notably, all observed density changes were  attributable to selective regulation of thin spines. At 4 h after injection, the  proximal spine density is unchanged in the core but significantly increased in the shell. At 24 h, the density of proximal dendritic spines is reduced in the core but increased in the shell. Such downregulation of thin spines in the core persists through 28 d of withdrawal, whereas the spine density in the shell returns to baseline levels. Consistent with previous results, dendritic tips exhibited upregulation of dendritic spines after 24 h of withdrawal, an effect localized to the shell. The divergence in regulation of proximal spine density in NAc core versus shell by cocaine correlates with recently reported electrophysiological data from a similar drug administration regimen and might represent a key mediator of changes in the reward circuit that drive aspects of addiction.", "22544310": "Dopamine signaling is implicated in reinforcement learning, but the neural substrates targeted by dopamine are poorly understood. We bypassed dopamine signaling itself and tested how optogenetic activation of dopamine D1 or D2 receptor\u2013expressing striatal projection neurons influenced reinforcement learning in mice. Stimulating D1 receptor\u2013expressing neurons induced persistent reinforcement, whereas stimulating D2 receptor\u2013expressing neurons induced transient punishment, indicating that activation of these circuits is sufficient  to modify the probability of performing future actions.", "21716290": "The basolateral amygdala (BLA) has a crucial role in emotional learning irrespective of valence. The BLA projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to modulate cue-triggered motivated behaviours, but our understanding of  the interaction between these two brain regions has been limited by the inability to manipulate neural-circuit elements of this pathway selectively during behaviour. To circumvent this limitation, we used in vivo optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of glutamatergic fibres from the BLA to the NAc, coupled with intracranial pharmacology and ex vivo electrophysiology. Here we show that optical stimulation of the pathway from the BLA to the NAc in mice reinforces behavioural responding to earn additional optical stimulation of these synaptic inputs. Optical stimulation of these glutamatergic fibres required intra-NAc dopamine D1-type receptor signalling, but not D2-type receptor signalling. Brief  optical inhibition of fibres from the BLA to the NAc reduced cue-evoked intake of sucrose, demonstrating an important role of this specific pathway in controlling  naturally occurring reward-related behaviour. Moreover, although optical stimulation of glutamatergic fibres from the medial prefrontal cortex to the NAc  also elicited reliable excitatory synaptic responses, optical self-stimulation behaviour was not observed by activation of this pathway. These data indicate that whereas the BLA is important for processing both positive and negative affect, the glutamatergic pathway from the BLA to the NAc, in conjunction with dopamine signalling in the NAc, promotes motivated behavioural responding. Thus,  optogenetic manipulation of anatomically distinct synaptic inputs to the NAc reveals functionally distinct properties of these inputs in controlling reward-seeking behaviours.", "21713123": "The development of BAC transgenic mice expressing promoter-specific fluorescent reporter proteins has been a great asset for neuroscience by enabling detection of neuronal subsets in live tissue. For the study of basal ganglia physiology, reporters driven by type 1 and 2 dopamine receptors have been particularly useful for distinguishing the two classes of striatal projection neurons - striatonigral and striatopallidal. However, emerging evidence suggests that some of the transgenic reporter lines may have suboptimal features. The ideal transgenic reporter line should (1) express a reporter with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting the cellular subset of interest and that does not otherwise alter the biology of the cells in which it is expressed, and (2) involve a genetic manipulation that does not cause any additional genetic effects other than expression of the reporter. Here we introduce a new BAC transgenic reporter line, Drd1a-tdTomato line 6, with features that approximate these ideals, offering substantial benefits over existing lines. In this study, we investigate the integrity of dopamine-sensitive behaviors and test the sensitivity and specificity of tdTomato fluorescence for identifying striatonigral projection neurons in mice. Behaviorally, hemizygous Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 mice are similar  to littermate controls; while hemizygous Drd2-EGFP mice are not. In characterizing the sensitivity and specificity of line 6 mice, we find that both  are high. The results of this characterization indicate that line 6 Drd1a-tdTomato+/- mice offer a useful alternative approach to identify both striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons in a single transgenic line with a high degree of accuracy.", "21377654": "BACKGROUND: The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a brain region critically involved in  psychostimulant-induced neuroadaptations. A major proportion of NAc neurons consists of medium spiny neurons (MSNs), commonly divided into two major subsets  on the basis of their expression of D1 dopamine receptors (D1R-MSNs) or D2 dopamine receptors (D2R-MSNs). Although NAc MSNs are known to undergo extensive alterations in their characteristics upon exposure to drugs of abuse, the functional and structural changes specific to each type of MSN have yet to be fully resolved. METHODS: We repeatedly injected cocaine into transgenic mice expressing enhanced  green fluorescent protein under the control of promoters for either D1R or D2R and then analyzed the physiological characteristics of each type of MSN by whole-cell recording. We also analyzed cocaine-induced changes of spine densities of individual MSNs with recombinant lentivirus in a cell type-specific manner and corroborated findings by use of a pathway-specific labeling using recombinant rabies virus. RESULTS: The D1R-MSNs exhibited decreased membrane excitability but increased frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents after repeated cocaine administration, whereas D2R-MSNs displayed a decrease in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency with no change in excitability. Interestingly, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents decreased in D1R-MSNs but were unaffected in D2R-MSNs. Moreover, morphological analyses revealed a selective increase in spine density in D1R-MSNs after chronic cocaine exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first experimental evidence that NAc MSNs differentially contribute to psychostimulant-induced neuroadaptations by changing their intrinsic, synaptic, and structural characteristics in a cell type-specific fashion.", "20613723": "Neural circuits of the basal ganglia are critical for motor planning and action selection. Two parallel basal ganglia pathways have been described, and have been proposed to exert opposing influences on motor function. According to this classical model, activation of the 'direct' pathway facilitates movement and activation of the 'indirect' pathway inhibits movement. However, more recent anatomical and functional evidence has called into question the validity of this  hypothesis. Because this model has never been empirically tested, the specific function of these circuits in behaving animals remains unknown. Here we report direct activation of basal ganglia circuitry in vivo, using optogenetic control of direct- and indirect-pathway medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs), achieved  through Cre-dependent viral expression of channelrhodopsin-2 in the striatum of bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under  control of regulatory elements for the dopamine D1 or D2 receptor. Bilateral excitation of indirect-pathway MSNs elicited a parkinsonian state, distinguished  by increased freezing, bradykinesia and decreased locomotor initiations. In contrast, activation of direct-pathway MSNs reduced freezing and increased locomotion. In a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, direct-pathway activation completely rescued deficits in freezing, bradykinesia and locomotor initiation. Taken together, our findings establish a critical role for basal ganglia circuitry in the bidirectional regulation of motor behaviour and indicate that modulation of direct-pathway circuitry may represent an effective therapeutic strategy for ameliorating parkinsonian motor deficits.", "20056891": "Cocaine-induced alterations in gene expression cause changes in neuronal morphology and behavior that may underlie cocaine addiction. In mice, we identified an essential role for histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) dimethylation and the  lysine dimethyltransferase G9a in cocaine-induced structural and behavioral plasticity. Repeated cocaine administration reduced global levels of H3K9 dimethylation in the nucleus accumbens. This reduction in histone methylation was mediated through the repression of G9a in this brain region, which was regulated  by the cocaine-induced transcription factor DeltaFosB. Using conditional mutagenesis and viral-mediated gene transfer, we found that G9a down-regulation increased the dendritic spine plasticity of nucleus accumbens neurons and enhanced the preference for cocaine, thereby establishing a crucial role for histone methylation in the long-term actions of cocaine.", "18760700": "Both the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) contribute to learned behavioral choice. Neurons in both structures that encode reward-predictive cues may underlie the decision to respond to such cues, but the neural circuits by which the BLA influences reward-seeking behavior have not been established. Here, we test the hypothesis that the BLA drives NAc neuronal responses to reward-predictive cues. First, using a disconnection experiment, we  show that the BLA and dopamine projections to the NAc interact to promote the reward-seeking behavioral response. Next, we demonstrate that BLA neuronal responses to cues precede those of NAc neurons and that cue-evoked excitation of  NAc neurons depends on BLA input. These results indicate that BLA input is required for dopamine to enhance the cue-evoked firing of NAc neurons and that this enhanced firing promotes reward-seeking behavior.", "17287809": "The striatum is a major forebrain nucleus that integrates cortical and thalamic afferents and forms the input nucleus of the basal ganglia. Striatal projection neurons target the substantia nigra pars reticulata (direct pathway) or the lateral globus pallidus (indirect pathway). Imbalances between neural activity in these two pathways have been proposed to underlie the profound motor deficits observed in Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. However, little is known about differences in cellular and synaptic properties in these circuits. Indeed, current hypotheses suggest that these cells express similar forms of synaptic plasticity. Here we show that excitatory synapses onto indirect-pathway  medium spiny neurons (MSNs) exhibit higher release probability and larger N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor currents than direct-pathway synapses. Moreover, indirect-pathway MSNs selectively express endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD), which requires dopamine D2 receptor activation. In models of Parkinson's disease, indirect-pathway eCB-LTD is absent but is rescued by a D2 receptor agonist or inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation. Administration of  these drugs together in vivo reduces parkinsonian motor deficits, suggesting that endocannabinoid-mediated depression of indirect-pathway synapses has a critical role in the control of movement. These findings have implications for understanding the normal functions of the basal ganglia, and also suggest approaches for the development of therapeutic drugs for the treatment of striatal-based brain disorders.", "16492766": "Psychostimulant-induced alteration of dendritic spines on dopaminoceptive neurons in nucleus accumbens (NAcc) has been hypothesized as an adaptive neuronal response that is linked to long-lasting addictive behaviors. NAcc is largely composed of two distinct subpopulations of medium-sized spiny neurons expressing  high levels of either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors. In the present study, we analyzed dendritic spine density after chronic cocaine treatment in distinct D1 or D2 receptor-containing medium-sized spiny neurons in NAcc. These studies made  use of transgenic mice that expressed EGFP under the control of either the D1 or  D2 receptor promoter (Drd1-EGFP or Drd2-EGFP). After 28 days of cocaine treatment and 2 days of withdrawal, spine density increased in both Drd1-EGFP- and Drd2-EGFP-positive neurons. However, the increase in spine density was maintained only in Drd1-EGFP-positive neurons 30 days after drug withdrawal. Notably, increased DeltaFosB expression also was observed in Drd1-EGFP- and Drd2-EGFP-positive neurons after 2 days of drug withdrawal but only in Drd1-EGFP-positive neurons after 30 days of drug withdrawal. These results suggest that the increased spine density observed after chronic cocaine treatment is stable only in D1-receptor-containing neurons and that DeltaFosB expression is associated with the formation and/or the maintenance of dendritic spines in D1 as well as D2 receptor-containing neurons in NAcc.", "11694884": "A compelling model of experience-dependent plasticity is the long-lasting sensitization to the locomotor stimulatory effects of drugs of abuse. Adaptations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a component of the mesolimbic dopamine system, are thought to contribute to this behavioral change. Here we examine excitatory synaptic transmission in NAc slices prepared from animals displaying sensitization 10-14 days after repeated in vivo cocaine exposure. The ratio of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazole propionic acid) receptor- to NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) was decreased at synapses made by prefrontal cortical afferents onto medium spiny neurons in the shell of the NAc. The amplitude of miniature EPSCs at these synapses also was decreased, as was the magnitude of long-term depression.  These data suggest that chronic in vivo administration of cocaine elicits a long-lasting depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in the NAc, a change  that may contribute to behavioral sensitization and addiction.", "4080159": "Afferents to the nucleus accumbens have been studied with the retrograde transport of unconjugated wheatgerm agglutinin as detected by immunohistochemistry using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method, in order to define precisely afferent topography from the cortex, thalamus, midbrain and amygdala. Cortical afferent topography was extremely precise. The largest number  of cells was found following injections to the anterior accumbens. Anteromedial injections labelled a very large extent of the subiculum and part of the entorhinal cortex. Anterolateral injections produced less subicular and entorhinal label but also labelled the posterior perirhinal cortex. Posteromedial injections labelled only the ventral subiculum and a few cells in the adjacent medial entorhinal cortex. Posterolateral injections labelled few lateral entorhinal neurones but did label a long anteroposterior strip of perirhinal cortex. Prefrontal cortex label was found only after anterior accumbens injections. In the amygdala labelled neurones were found in cortical, central, lateral posterior, anteromedial and basolateral nuclei. Basolateral amygdala projected chiefly to the anteromedial accumbens and central nucleus to anterolateral accumbens. Only a weak amygdala label was found after posterior accumbens injections. In the ventral tegmental area, the midline interfascicular  nucleus projected only to medial accumbens. The paranigral ventral tegmentum projected chiefly to the medial accumbens and the parabrachial area chiefly to the lateral accumbens. In the thalamus, heaviest label was found after anterior accumbens injections. Most cells were found in the paraventricular, reuniens and  rhomboid nuclei and at posterior thalamic levels lying medial to the fasciculus retroflexus. There was only restricted topography found from thalamic sites. Retrograde label was also found in the ventral pallidum and lateral hypothalamus. Single small injection sites within accumbens received input from the whole anteroposterior extent of the thalamus and ventral tegmentum. The medial accumbens was found to have a close relationship to habenula, globus pallidus and interfascicular nucleus. It appeared that the heaviest volume of inputs projected to anteromedial accumbens, where output from hippocampus (CAI), subiculum, entorhinal and prefrontal cortices converged with output from amygdala, midline thalamus and ventral tegmentum.", "2147780": "The striatum, which is the major component of the basal ganglia in the brain, is  regulated in part by dopaminergic input from the substantia nigra. Severe movement disorders result from the loss of striatal dopamine in patients with Parkinson's disease. Rats with lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway caused by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) serve as a model for Parkinson's disease and show alterations in gene expression in the two major output systems of the striatum to the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Striatopallidal neurons show a 6-OHDA-induced elevation in their specific expression of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding the D2 dopamine receptor and enkephalin, which is reversed by subsequent continuous treatment with the D2 agonist quinpirole. Conversely, striatonigral neurons show a 6-OHDA-induced reduction in their specific expression of mRNAs encoding the D1 dopamine receptor and substance P, which is reversed by subsequent daily injections of the D1 agonist SKF-38393. This treatment also increases dynorphin mRNA in striatonigral neurons.

As acetylcholine does not directly evoke postsynaptic events at  most striatal synapses, it remains unclear how postsynaptic cholinergic receptors encode the firing patterns of CHIs in the striatum. To examine the dynamics of acetylcholine release, we used optogenetics and paired recordings from CHIs and medium spiny neurons (MSNs) virally overexpressing G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. Due to the efficient coupling between endogenous muscarinic receptors and GIRK channels, we found that firing of individual CHIs resulted in monosynaptic spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) in MSNs. Paired CHI-MSN recordings revealed that the high probability of acetylcholine release at these synapses allowed muscarinic receptors to faithfully encode physiological activity patterns from individual CHIs without failure. These results indicate that muscarinic receptors in striatal output neurons reliably decode CHI firing.", "25374536": "The striatum plays a central role in motor control and motor learning. Appropriate responses to environmental stimuli, including pursuit of reward or avoidance of aversive experience all require functional striatal circuits. These  pathways integrate synaptic inputs from limbic and cortical regions including sensory, motor and motivational information to ultimately connect intention to action. Although many neurotransmitters participate in striatal circuitry, one critically important player is acetylcholine (ACh). Relative to other brain areas, the striatum contains exceptionally high levels of ACh, the enzymes that catalyze its synthesis and breakdown, as well as both nicotinic and muscarinic receptor types that mediate its postsynaptic effects. The principal source of striatal ACh is the cholinergic interneuron (ChI), which comprises only about 1-2% of all striatal cells yet sends dense arbors of projections throughout the striatum. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the factors affecting the excitability of these neurons through acute effects and long term changes in their synaptic inputs. In addition, we discuss the physiological effects of ACh in the striatum, and how changes in ACh levels may contribute to disease states during striatal dysfunction.", "25173629": "BACKGROUND: The nucleus accumbens is a critical mediator of depression-related outcomes to social defeat stress. Previous studies demonstrate distinct neuroplasticity adaptations in the two medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes, those  enriched in dopamine receptor D1 versus dopamine receptor D2, in reward and reinforcement leading to opposing roles for these MSNs in these behaviors. However, the distinct roles of nucleus accumbens MSN subtypes, in depression, remain poorly understood. METHODS: Using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, we examined excitatory input to MSN subtypes and intrinsic excitability measures in D1-green fluorescent protein and D2-green fluorescent protein bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice that underwent chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Optogenetic and pharmacogenetic approaches were used to bidirectionally alter firing of D1-MSNs or D2-MSNs after CSDS or before a subthreshold social defeat stress in D1-Cre or D2-Cre bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the frequency of excitatory synaptic input is decreased in D1-MSNs and increased in D2-MSNs in mice displaying depression-like  behaviors after CSDS. Enhancing activity in D1-MSNs results in resilient behavioral outcomes, while inhibition of these MSNs induces depression-like outcomes after CSDS. Bidirectional modulation of D2-MSNs does not alter behavioral responses to CSDS; however, repeated activation of D2-MSNs in stress na\u00efve mice induces social avoidance following subthreshold social defeat stress. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies uncover novel functions of MSN subtypes in depression-like outcomes. Notably, bidirectional alteration of D1-MSN activity promotes opposite behavioral outcomes to chronic social stress. Therefore, targeting D1-MSN activity may provide novel treatment strategies for depression or other affective disorders.", "22222701": "Striatal cholinergic interneurons are pivotal modulators of the striatal circuitry involved in action selection and decision making. Although nicotinic receptors are important transducers of acetylcholine release in the striatum, muscarinic receptors are more pervasive and have been more thoroughly studied. In this review, the effects of muscarinic receptor signaling on the principal cell types in the striatum and its canonical circuits will be discussed, highlighting  new insights into their role in synaptic integration and plasticity. These studies, and those that have identified new circuit elements driven by activation of nicotinic receptors, make it clear that temporally patterned activity in cholinergic interneurons must play an important role in determining the effects on striatal circuitry. These effects could be critical to the response to salient environmental stimuli that serve to direct behavior.", "19914605": "BACKGROUND: While most patients with depression respond to combinations of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), there are patients requiring other treatments. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) allows modulation of brain regions that are dysfunctional in depression. Since anhedonia is a feature of depression and there is evidence of dysfunction of the reward system, DBS to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) might be promising. METHODS: Ten patients suffering from very resistant forms of depression (treatment-resistant depression [TRD]), not responding to pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or ECT, were implanted with bilateral DBS electrodes in the NAcc.  The mean (+/-SD) length of the current episode was 10.8 (+/-7.5) years; the number of past treatment courses was 20.8 (+/-8.4); and the mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was 32.5 (+/-5.3). RESULTS: Twelve months following initiation of DBS treatment, five patients reached 50% reduction of the HDRS (responders, HDRS = 15.4 [+/-2.8]). The number  of hedonic activities increased significantly. Interestingly, ratings of anxiety  (Hamilton Anxiety Scale) were reduced in the whole group but more pronounced in the responders. The [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography data revealed that NAcc-DBS decreased metabolism in the subgenual cingulate and in prefrontal regions including orbital prefrontal cortex. A volume of interest analysis comparing responders and nonresponders identified metabolic decreases in the amygdala. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate antidepressant and antianhedonic effects of DBS to NAcc in patients suffering from TRD. In contrast to other DBS depression studies, there was also an antianxiety effect. These effects are correlated with localized metabolic changes.", "18495884": "The principal neurons of the striatum, GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs), are interconnected by local recurrent axon collateral synapses. Although critical to  many striatal models, it is not clear whether these connections are random or whether they preferentially link functionally related groups of MSNs. To address  this issue, dual whole patch-clamp recordings were made from striatal MSNs in brain slices taken from transgenic mice in which D(1) or D(2) dopamine receptor expression was reported with EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein). These studies revealed that unidirectional connections were common between both D(1) receptor-expressing MSN (D(1) MSN) pairs (26%) and D(2) receptor-expressing MSN (D(2) MSN) pairs (36%). D(2) MSNs also commonly formed synapses on D(1) MSNs (27% of pairs). Conversely, only 6% of the D(1) MSNs formed detectable connections with D(2) MSNs. Furthermore, synaptic connections formed by D(1) MSNs were weaker than those formed by D(2) MSNs, a difference that was attributable to fewer GABA(A) receptors at D(1) MSN synapses. The strength of detectable recurrent connections was dramatically reduced in Parkinson's disease models. The studies demonstrate that recurrent collateral connections between MSNs are not random but rather differentially couple D(1) and D(2) MSNs. Moreover, this recurrent collateral network appears to be disrupted in Parkinson's disease models, potentially contributing to pathological alterations in MSN activity patterns and psychomotor symptoms.", "16675398": "Long-term depression (LTD) of the synapse formed between cortical pyramidal neurons and striatal medium spiny neurons is central to many theories of motor plasticity and associative learning. The induction of LTD at this synapse is thought to depend upon D(2) dopamine receptors localized in the postsynaptic membrane. If this were true, LTD should be inducible in neurons from only one of  the two projection systems of the striatum. Using transgenic mice in which neurons that contribute to these two systems are labeled, we show that this is not the case. Rather, in both cell types, the D(2) receptor dependence of LTD induction reflects the need to lower M(1) muscarinic receptor activity-a goal accomplished by D(2) receptors on cholinergic interneurons. In addition to reconciling discordant tracts of the striatal literature, these findings point to cholinergic interneurons as key mediators of dopamine-dependent striatal plasticity and learning.", "15474166": "The vast majority of neostriatal neurons and intrinsic intrastriatal synapses are GABAergic, the latter arising from axon collaterals of spiny projection neurons and from GABAergic interneurons. An important feature of the functional organization of the neostriatum has long been assumed to be the existence of a widespread lateral inhibitory network mediated by the axon collaterals of spiny projection neurons. However, these collateral connections have recently been demonstrated electrophysiologically to be relatively weak--in contrast to feedforward interneuronal inhibition, which exerts strong effects on spike timing in spiny neurons. These new data are incompatible with current \"winner-take-all\"  models of lateral inhibitory function in the neostriatum, and they force a modification of established concepts of the functional roles of feedback inhibition in this nucleus.", "15271494": "Since its conception three decades ago, the idea that the striatum consists of a  dorsal sensorimotor part and a ventral portion processing limbic information has  sparked a quest for functional correlates and anatomical characteristics of the striatal divisions. But this classic dorsal-ventral distinction might not offer the best view of striatal function. Anatomy and neurophysiology show that the two striatal areas have the same basic structure and that sharp boundaries are absent. Behaviorally, a distinction between dorsolateral and ventromedial seems most valid, in accordance with a mediolateral functional zonation imposed on the  striatum by its excitatory cortical, thalamic and amygdaloid inputs. Therefore, this review presents a synthesis between the dorsal-ventral distinction and the more mediolateral-oriented functional striatal gradient.", "8815934": "In recent years, the distribution of dopamine receptor subtypes among the principal neurons of the neostriatum has been the subject of debate. Conventional anatomical and physiological approaches have yielded starkly different estimates  of the extent to which D1 and D2 class dopamine receptors are colocalized. One plausible explanation for the discrepancy is that some dopamine receptors are present in physiologically significant numbers, but the mRNA for these receptors  is not detectable with conventional techniques. To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of DA receptors in individual neostriatal neurons by patch-clamp and RT-PCR techniques. Because of the strong correlation between peptide expression and projection site, medium spiny neurons were divided into three groups on the basis of expression of mRNA for enkephalin (ENK) and substance P (SP). Neurons expressing detectable levels of SP but not ENK had abundant mRNA for the D1a receptor. A subset of these cells (approximately 50%) coexpressed D3 or D4 receptor mRNA. Neurons expressing detectable levels of ENK but not SP had abundant mRNA for D2 receptor isoforms (short and long). A subset  (10-25%) of these neurons coexpressed D1a or D1b mRNAs. Neurons coexpressing ENK  and SP mRNAs consistently coexpressed D1a and D2 mRNAs in relatively high abundance. Functional analysis of neurons expressing lower abundance mRNAs revealed clear physiological consequences that could be attributed to these receptors. These results suggest that, although colocalization of D1a and D2 receptors is limited, functional D1 and D2 class receptors are colocalized in nearly one-half of all medium spiny projection neurons.", "2479133": "Basal ganglia disorders are a heterogeneous group of clinical syndromes with a common anatomic locus within the basal ganglia. To account for the variety of clinical manifestations associated with insults to various parts of the basal ganglia we propose a model in which specific types of basal ganglia disorders are associated with changes in the function of subpopulations of striatal projection  neurons. This model is based on a synthesis of experimental animal and post-mortem human anatomic and neurochemical data. Hyperkinetic disorders, which  are characterized by an excess of abnormal movements, are postulated to result from the selective impairment of striatal neurons projecting to the lateral globus pallidus. Hypokinetic disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, are hypothesized to result from a complex series of changes in the activity of striatal projection neuron subpopulations resulting in an increase in basal ganglia output. This model suggests that the activity of subpopulations of striatal projection neurons is differentially regulated by striatal afferents and that different striatal projection neuron subpopulations may mediate different aspects of motor control.", "1374971": "The striatum, which is the major component of the basal ganglia, displays a complex mosaic organization of neurochemical systems that are related to its neuroanatomical connections. This mosaic organization reflects multiple levels of functional compartments. The first level is determined by the segregation of two  major striatal output systems, one to the globus pallidus (external segment) and  the other to the entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra. The second level segregates the cortical outputs of sublaminae of layer V between the patch and matrix compartments of the striatum, which project to the dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra, respectively. The third level is related to the topography of cortical inputs by which regions of the striatum may be functionally defined on the basis of the cortical areas with which they are connected. Neurochemical markers display complex mosaic patterns in the striatum  that, when examined in the context of the multi-level compartmental organization  of the striatum, reveal the highly organized manner by which the striatum processes cortical information.", "27450032": "BACKGROUND: Understanding the neural mechanisms of psychiatric disorders requires the use of rodent models; however, frontal-striatal homologies between rodents and primates are unclear. In contrast, within the striatum, the shell of the nucleus accumbens, the hippocampal projection zone, and the amygdala projection zone (referred to as the striatal emotion processing network [EPN]) are conserved across species. We used the relationship between the EPN and projections from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to assess network  similarities across rats and monkeys. METHODS: We first compared the location and extent of each major component of the EPN in rats and macaques. Next, we used anatomic cases with anterograde injections in ACC/OFC to determine the extent to which corticostriatal terminal fields overlapped with these components and with each other. RESULTS: The location and size of each component of the EPN were similar across species, containing projections primarily from infralimbic cortex in rats and area 25 in monkeys. Other ACC/OFC terminals overlapped extensively with infralimbic cortex/area 25 projections, supporting cross-species similarities in  OFC topography. However, dorsal ACC had different connectivity profiles across species. These results were used to segment the monkey and rat striata according  to ACC/OFC inputs. CONCLUSIONS: Based on connectivity with the EPN, and consistent with prior literature, the infralimbic cortex and area 25 are likely homologues. We also see evidence of OFC homologies. Along with segmenting the striatum and identifying striatal hubs of overlapping inputs, these results help to translate findings between rodent models and human pathology.", "23354054": "The basal ganglia are subcortical nuclei that control voluntary actions, and they are affected by a number of debilitating neurological disorders. The prevailing model of basal ganglia function proposes that two orthogonal projection circuits  originating from distinct populations of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the striatum--the so-called direct and indirect pathways--have opposing effects on movement: activity of direct-pathway SPNs is thought to facilitate movement, whereas activity of indirect-pathway SPNs is presumed to inhibit movement. This model has been difficult to test owing to the lack of methods to selectively measure the activity of direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs in freely moving animals. Here we develop a novel in vivo method to specifically measure direct- and indirect-pathway SPN activity, using Cre-dependent viral expression of the genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) GCaMP3 in the dorsal striatum of D1-Cre (direct-pathway-specific) and A2A-Cre (indirect-pathway-specific) mice. Using fibre optics and time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) in mice performing an operant task, we observed transient increases in neural activity in both direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs when animals initiated actions, but not when they were inactive. Concurrent activation of SPNs from both pathways in one  hemisphere preceded the initiation of contraversive movements and predicted the occurrence of specific movements within 500\u2009ms. These observations challenge the  classical view of basal ganglia function and may have implications for understanding the origin of motor symptoms in basal ganglia disorders.", "15356204": "Most neurons in the neostriatum are GABAergic spiny projection neurons with extensive local axon collaterals innervating principally other spiny projection neurons. The other source of GABAergic inputs to spiny neurons derives from a small number of interneurons, of which the best characterized are the parvalbumin-containing, fast-spiking interneurons. Spiny neuron collateral inhibition was not demonstrated until recently, because the IPSPs recorded at the soma are surprisingly small. In contrast, interneuronal inhibition was readily detected, comprising much larger IPSPs. Here, we report the application of quantal analysis and compartmental modeling to compare and contrast IPSCs in spiny neurons originating from axon collaterals and interneurons. The results indicate that individual release sites at spiny and interneuron synapses have similar quantal sizes and baseline release probabilities. Interneuronal unitary IPSCs are several times larger because of their proximal location on the neuron and because they have a larger number of transmitter release sites. Despite the small amount of current they can deliver to the soma, spiny cell collateral synapses had moderately high baseline release probabilities (0.5-0.9), suggesting that they are not weak because of some form of depression or modulation. The size of unitary collateral synaptic currents increased monotonically during development. These results argue against models of competitive inhibition in neostriatum, including those in which competitive inhibition is transiently effective during development and learning, and suggest a different role for the spiny cell axon collaterals.", "2478598": "In the caudate-putamen of the rat a patch/matrix organization can be recognized on the basis of the immunohistochemical distribution of several markers, which include enkephalin, substance P, dopamine, and calcium-binding protein. In the present experiments the distributional relations of these markers were investigated in the nucleus accumbens. The distribution of enkephalin fibers shows different inhomogeneities according to their location in the nucleus. Rostrally, heavily labeled areas stand out against a moderately stained background, whereas caudally, in medial and ventral parts of the nucleus, lightly stained areas delineate regions in the moderately stained neuropil. In the distribution of substance P, areas with high staining intensity were observed in  the medial and ventral parts of the nucleus accumbens. Inhomogeneities in the distribution of strong dopamine immunoreactivity consist of weakly immunoreactive areas throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the nucleus accumbens and extremely heavily labeled areas in the medial and ventral parts of the nucleus. Calcium-binding protein immunoreactivity can only be detected in dorsal parts of  the nucleus. The generally intense immunostaining for calcium-binding protein is  interspersed with \"blanks\" of weak immunoreactivity. The heavily and moderately labeled enkephalin areas each maintain specific relations with inhomogeneities in the distribution of substance P, dopamine, and calcium-binding protein. Rostrally, the heavily labeled enkephalin areas coincide with areas strongly immunostained for calcium-binding protein and with lightly stained areas in the dopamine and substance P immunoreactivity patterns. In the same region lightly stained areas in the enkephalin distribution match heavily labeled substance P areas. Caudally, in the border region of the nucleus accumbens and the caudate-putamen, the heavily labeled enkephalin areas are either related to \"blanks\" or to the intense staining regions in the calcium-binding protein immunoreactivity distribution. The moderately labeled enkephalin areas caudomedially in the nucleus accumbens are in register with the heavily labeled regions in the distribution of substance P and with the extremely heavily labeled regions in the distribution of dopamine. Relations with connectivity are discussed and the inhomogeneities are compared to those in the caudate-putamen. It is concluded that in the ventral striatum either one patch and one matrix compartment exist with different immunohistochemical relationships or there are several compartments with different immunohistochemical characteristics and different input-output relations.", "18619984": "Relapse to alcohol use after periods of abstinence is a hallmark behavioral pathology of alcoholism and a major clinical problem. Emerging evidence indicates that metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) antagonists attenuate relapse to  alcohol-seeking behavior but the molecular mechanisms of this potential therapeutic effect remain unexplored. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway is downstream of mGluR5 and has been implicated in addiction. We sought to determine if cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior, and its reduction by an mGluR5 antagonist, is associated with changes in ERK1/2 activation in reward-related limbic brain regions. Selectively-bred alcohol-preferring (P) rats were trained to lever press on a concurrent schedule  of alcohol (15% v/v) vs. water reinforcement. Following 9 days of extinction, rats were given an additional extinction trial or injected with the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (0, 1, 3, or 10mg/kg) and tested for cue-induced reinstatement. Brains were removed 90-min later from the rats in the extinction and MPEP (0 or 10mg/kg) conditions for analysis of p-ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, and p-ERK5 immunoreactivity (IR). Cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior was  associated with a three to five-fold increase in p-ERK1/2 IR in the basolateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens shell. MPEP administration blocked both the relapse-like behavior and increase in p-ERK1/2 IR. p-ERK1/2 IR in the central amygdala and NAcb core was dissociated with the relapse-like behavior and the pharmacological effect of mGluR5 blockade. No changes in total ERK or p-ERK5 were observed. These results suggest that exposure to cues previously associated with  alcohol self-administration is sufficient to produce concomitant increases in relapse-like behavior and ERK1/2 activation in specific limbic brain regions. Pharmacological compounds, such as mGluR5 antagonists, that reduce cue-induced ERK1/2 activation may be useful for treatment of relapse in alcoholics that is triggered by exposure to environmental events.", "17085074": "Drug addiction results in part from the distortion of dopamine-controlled plasticity, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) plays an important role in the underlying molecular mechanisms of this process. ERK is activated by  drugs of abuse in a subset of neurons in reward-related brain regions. This activation, necessary for the expression of immediate early genes, depends upon dopamine D1 and glutamate receptors. Blockade of ERK activation prevents long-lasting behavioral changes, including psychomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference. It also interferes with drug craving and drug-associated memory reconsolidation. By contrast, ERK1 mutation enhances the effects of morphine and cocaine. We suggest that the ERK2 pathway acts as a logical AND gate, permissive for plasticity, in neurons on which dopamine-mediated reward signals and glutamate-mediated contextual information converge.", "11102476": "A central feature of drugs of abuse is to induce gene expression in discrete brain structures that are critically involved in behavioral responses related to  addictive processes. Although extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) has been implicated in several neurobiological processes, including neuronal plasticity, its role in drug addiction remains poorly understood. This study was  designed to analyze the activation of ERK by cocaine, its involvement in cocaine-induced early and long-term behavioral effects, as well as in gene expression. We show, by immunocytochemistry, that acute cocaine administration activates ERK throughout the striatum, rapidly but transiently. This activation was blocked when SCH 23390 [a specific dopamine (DA)-D1 antagonist] but not raclopride (a DA-D2 antagonist) was injected before cocaine. Glutamate receptors  of NMDA subtypes also participated in ERK activation, as shown after injection of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK 801. The systemic injection of SL327, a selective inhibitor of the ERK kinase MEK, before cocaine, abolished the cocaine-induced ERK activation and decreased cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion, indicating a role of this pathway in events underlying early behavioral responses. Moreover, the rewarding effects of cocaine were abolished by SL327 in the place-conditioning paradigm. Because SL327 antagonized cocaine-induced c-fos expression and Elk-1 hyperphosphorylation, we suggest that the ERK intracellular signaling cascade is  also involved in the prime burst of gene expression underlying long-term behavioral changes induced by cocaine. Altogether, these results reveal a new mechanism to explain behavioral responses of cocaine related to its addictive properties.", "11002906": "The question of addiction specifically concerns (1), the process by which drug-taking behavior, in certain individuals, evolves into compulsive patterns of drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior that take place at the expense of most other activities and (2), the inability to cease drug-taking; the problem of relapse. In this paper current biopsychological views of addiction are critically evaluated in light of the \"incentive-sensitization theory of addiction\", which we first proposed in 1993, and new developments in research are incorporated. We argue that traditional negative reinforcement, positive reinforcement, and hedonic accounts of addiction are neither necessary nor sufficient to account for compulsive patterns of drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior. Four major tenets of the incentive-sensitization view are discussed. These are: (1) Potentially addictive drugs share the ability to produce long-lasting adaptations in neural systems. (2) The brain systems that are changed include those normally involved in the process of incentive motivation and reward. (3) The critical neuroadaptations for addiction render these brain reward systems hypersensitive (\"sensitized\") to drugs and drug-associated stimuli. (4) The brain systems that are sensitized do not mediate the pleasurable or euphoric effects of drugs (drug  \"liking\"), but instead they mediate a subcomponent of reward we have termed incentive salience (drug \"wanting\"). We also discuss the role that mesolimbic dopamine systems play in reward, evidence that neural sensitization happens in humans, and the implications of incentive-sensitization for the development of therapies in the treatment of addiction.", "10972458": "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Repeated exposure to many drugs of abuse results in a progressive and enduring enhancement in the motor stimulant effect elicited by a  subsequent drug challenge. This phenomenon, termed behavioral sensitization, is thought to underlie certain aspects of drug addiction. Behavioral sensitization is the consequence of drug-induced neuroadaptive changes in a circuit involving dopaminergic and glutamatergic interconnections between the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex and amygdala. METHODS: The literature was critically reviewed in an effort to discern the relative roles of glutamate and dopamine transmission in the induction and expression of sensitization to amphetamine, cocaine and mu-opioids. In addition,  the literature was reviewed to evaluate distinctions between these drugs in the involvement of the relevant brain nuclei listed above. RESULTS: The common substrates between sensitizing drugs are glutamate transmission, especially at the NMDA receptor, and an action in the ventral tegmental area. In contrast, a role for dopamine is only clearly seen in amphetamine sensitization and critical involvement of nuclei outside the ventral  tegmental area is found for cocaine and morphine. While enhanced dopamine transmission is associated with sensitization by all three drugs, a role for glutamate is clearly identified only with cocaine sensitization. Accordingly, glutamatergic cortical and allocortical brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex appear more critical for cocaine sensitization. CONCLUSIONS: The distinctions between drugs in the induction and expression of sensitization indicate that behavioral sensitization can arise from multiple neuroadaptations in multiple brain nuclei. This is not only the result of distinct molecular targets for the drugs, but may also include a differential involvement of learned associations. It is postulated that the relatively more robust pharmacological capacity of amphetamine to release dopamine may induce a form of sensitization that is more dependent on adaptations in mesoaccumbens dopamine transmission compared with cocaine and morphine sensitization.", "9403138": "Repeated exposure to psychostimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine produces behavioral sensitization, which is characterized by an augmented locomotor response to a subsequent psychostimulant challenge injection. Experimentation focused on the neural underpinnings of behavioral sensitization has progressed from a singular focus on dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens and striatum to the study of cellular and molecular mechanisms that occur throughout  the neural circuitry in which the mesocorticolimbic dopamine projections are embedded. This research effort has yielded a conglomerate of data that has resisted simple interpretations, primarily because no single neuronal effect is likely to be responsible for the expression of behavioral sensitization. The present review examines the literature and critically evaluates the extent to which the neural consequences of repeated psychostimulant administration are associated with the expression of behavioral sensitization. The neural alterations found to contribute to the long-term expression of behavioral sensitization are centered in a collection of interconnected limbic nuclei, which are termed the 'motive' circuit. This neural circuit is used as a template to organize the relevant biochemical and molecular findings into a model of the expression of behavioral sensitization.", "1665095": "Progress has been made over the last 10 years in determining the neural mechanisms of sensitization induced by amphetamine-like psychostimulants, opioids and stressors. Changes in dopamine transmission in axon terminal fields such as the nucleus accumbens appear to underlie the expression of sensitization, but the actions of drugs and stressors in the somatodendritic regions of the A10/A9 dopamine neurons seem critical for the initiation of sensitization. Manipulations that increase somatodendritic dopamine release and permit the stimulation of D1 dopamine receptors in this region induce changes in the dopamine system that lead to the development of long-term sensitization. However, it is not known exactly how the changes in the A10/A9 region are encoded to permit augmented dopamine transmission in the terminal field. One possibility is that the dopamine neurons  of sensitized animals have become increasingly sensitive to excitatory pharmacological and environmental stimuli or desensitized to inhibitory regulation. Alternatively, changes in cellular activity or protein synthesis may  result in a change in the presynaptic regulation of axon terminal dopamine release.", "25663648": "Animal models of relapse reveal that the motivation to seek drug is regulated by  enduring morphological and physiological changes in the nucleus accumbens, as well as transient synaptic potentiation in the accumbens core (NAcore) that parallels drug-seeking behavior. The current study sought to examine the link between the behavioral and synaptic consequences of cue-induced cocaine seeking by optically silencing glutamatergic afferents to the NAcore from the prelimbic cortex (PL). Adeno-associated virus coding for the inhibitory opsin archaerhodopsin was microinjected into PL, and optical fibers were targeted to NAcore. Animals were trained to self-administer cocaine followed by extinction training, and then underwent cue-induced reinstatement in the presence or absence of 15 min of optically induced inhibition of PL fibers in NAcore. Inhibiting the  PL-to-NAcore projection blocked reinstated behavior and was paralleled by decreased dendritic spine head diameter and AMPA/NMDA ratio relative to sham-laser control rats. Interestingly, while spine density was elevated after extinction training, no further effects were observed by cued reinstatement or optical inhibition. These findings validate the critical role for PL afferents to the NAcore in simultaneously regulating both reinstated behavior and the associated transient synaptic potentiation.", "23552889": "Loss of control over harmful drug seeking is one of the most intractable aspects  of addiction, as human substance abusers continue to pursue drugs despite incurring significant negative consequences. Human studies have suggested that deficits in prefrontal cortical function and consequential loss of inhibitory control could be crucial in promoting compulsive drug use. However, it remains unknown whether chronic drug use compromises cortical activity and, equally important, whether this deficit promotes compulsive cocaine seeking. Here we use  a rat model of compulsive drug seeking in which cocaine seeking persists in a subgroup of rats despite delivery of noxious foot shocks. We show that prolonged  cocaine self-administration decreases ex vivo intrinsic excitability of deep-layer pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic cortex, which was significantly more pronounced in compulsive drug-seeking animals. Furthermore, compensating for hypoactive prelimbic cortex neurons with in vivo optogenetic prelimbic cortex stimulation significantly prevented compulsive cocaine seeking, whereas optogenetic prelimbic cortex inhibition significantly increased compulsive cocaine seeking. Our results show a marked reduction in prelimbic cortex excitability in compulsive cocaine-seeking rats, and that in vivo optogenetic prelimbic cortex stimulation decreased compulsive drug-seeking behaviours. Thus,  targeted stimulation of the prefrontal cortex could serve as a promising therapy  for treating compulsive drug use.", "20401643": "Withdrawal from daily cocaine administration causes an increase in actin cycling  and increases spine head diameter in medium spiny neurons from the core of the nucleus accumbens. In order to determine if these two effects of cocaine are mechanistically linked, after 3\u00a0weeks of withdrawal from 1\u00a0week of daily cocaine  treatments, we microinjected latrunculin into the accumbens to inhibit actin polymerization and prevent actin cycling. In cocaine-treated animals, latrunculin-reduced dendritic spine density and decreased the levels of F-actin and PSD-95 in postsynaptic density subfractions. In contrast, latrunculin did not affect spine density or protein levels in saline-treated subjects. Cocaine withdrawn animals show an increase in spine head diameter 45\u00a0min after an acute injection of cocaine, and latrunculin abolished the ability of acute cocaine to increase spine head diameter and simultaneously inhibited the sensitized behavioral response. In contrast, latrunculin had no effect in control animals on the acute locomotor response to cocaine. Altogether, these data support previous  findings that withdrawal from cocaine is associated with increased actin cycling, and that the increase in actin cycling contributes to cocaine-induced changes in  spine morphology of medium spiny neurons in the accumbens core.", "15748840": "Prime diagnostic criteria for drug addiction include uncontrollable urges to obtain drugs and reduced behavioral responding for natural rewards. Cellular adaptations in the glutamate projection from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to the nucleus accumbens have been discovered in rats withdrawn from cocaine that may underlie these cardinal features of addiction. A hypothesis is articulated that altered G protein signaling in the PFC focuses behavior on drug-associated stimuli, while dysregulated PFC-accumbens synaptic glutamate transmission underlies the unmanageable motivation to seek drugs.", "15190253": "Dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex undergo activity-dependent structural remodelling that has been proposed to be a cellular basis of learning and memory. How structural remodelling supports synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation, and whether such plasticity is input-specific at the level of the individual spine has remained unknown. We investigated the structural basis of long-term potentiation using two-photon photolysis of caged glutamate at single spines of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Here we show that repetitive quantum-like photorelease (uncaging) of glutamate induces a rapid and selective enlargement of stimulated spines that is  transient in large mushroom spines but persistent in small spines. Spine enlargement is associated with an increase in AMPA-receptor-mediated currents at  the stimulated synapse and is dependent on NMDA receptors, calmodulin and actin polymerization. Long-lasting spine enlargement also requires Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. Our results thus indicate that spines individually follow Hebb's postulate for learning. They further suggest that small spines are preferential sites for long-term potentiation induction, whereas large spines might represent physical traces of long-term memory.", "10627585": "Modulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptors in the brain by phosphorylation may play a role in the expression of synaptic plasticity at central excitatory synapses. It is known from biochemical studies that GluR1 AMPA receptor subunits  can be phosphorylated within their C terminal by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A  (PKA), which is colocalized with the phosphatase calcineurin (i.e., phosphatase 2B). We have examined the effect of PKA and calcineurin on the time course, peak  open probability (P(O, PEAK)), and single-channel properties of glutamateevoked responses for neuronal AMPA receptors and homomeric GluR1(flip) receptors recorded in outside-out patches. Inclusion of purified catalytic subunit Calpha-PKA in the pipette solution increased neuronal AMPA receptor P(O,PEAK) (0.92) compared with recordings made with calcineurin included in the pipette (P(O,PEAK) 0.39). Similarly, Calpha-PKA increased P(O,PEAK) for recombinant GluR1 receptors (0. 78) compared with patches excised from cells cotransfected with a cDNA encoding the PKA peptide inhibitor PKI (P(O,PEAK) 0.50) or patches with calcineurin included in the pipette (P(O,PEAK) 0.42). Neither PKA nor calcineurin altered the amplitude of single-channel subconductance levels, weighted mean unitary current, mean channel open period, burst length, or macroscopic response  waveform for recombinant GluR1 receptors. Substitution of an amino acid at the PKA phosphorylation site (S845A) on GluR1 eliminated the PKA-induced increase in  P(O,PEAK), whereas the mutation of a Ca(2+), calmodulin-dependent kinase II and PKC phosphorylation site (S831A) was without effect. These results suggest that AMPA receptor peak response open probability can be increased by PKA through phosphorylation of GluR1 Ser845.", "15363398": "Oscillations and synchrony in basal ganglia circuits may play a key role in the organization of voluntary actions and habits. We recorded single units and local  field potentials from multiple striatal and cortical locations simultaneously, over a range of behavioral states. We observed opposite gradients of oscillatory  entrainment, with dorsal/lateral striatal neurons entrained to high-voltage spindle oscillations (\"spike wave discharges\") and ventral/medial striatal neurons entrained to the hippocampal theta rhythm. While the majority of units were likely medium-spiny projection neurons, a second neuronal population showed  characteristic features of fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons, including tonic activity, brief waveforms, and high-frequency bursts. These fired at an earlier spindle phase than the main neuronal population, and their density within striatum corresponded closely to the intensity of spindle oscillations. The orchestration of oscillatory activity by networks of striatal interneurons may be an important mechanism in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease.", "14729131": "We considered clinical observations in patients with obsessive-compulsive- and anxiety-disorders, who underwent bilateral anterior capsulotomy, as well as anatomical and pathophysiological findings. Based on these considerations, we choose the shell region of the right nucleus accumbens as target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in a pilot-series of four patients with severe obsessive-compulsive- and anxiety-disorders. Significant reduction in severity of symptoms has been achieved in three of four patients treated. Clinical results as well as a 15-O-H(2)O-PET study, perfomed in one patient during stimulation, speak in favour of the following hypothesis. As a central relay-structure between amygdala, basal ganglia, mesolimbic dopaminergic areas, mediodorsal thalamus and  prefrontal cortex, the accumbens nucleus seems to play a modulatory role in information flow from the amygdaloid complex to the latter areas. If disturbed, imbalanced information flow from the amygdaloid complex could yield obsessive-compulsive- and anxiety-disorders, which can be counteracted by blocking the information flow within the shell region of the accumbens nucleus by deep brain stimulation.", "10321252": "The basal ganglia are a highly interconnected network of nuclei essential for the modulation and execution of voluntary behavior. The neostriatum is the principal  input and one of the principal controllers of the output of the basal ganglia. Neostriatal projection neurons seem to be dynamically and powerfully controlled by GABAergic inputs, but the source(s) and physiological properties of these inputs remain unclear. Here we use paired whole-cell recordings to show that this inhibition derives from small populations of GABAergic interneurons that are themselves interconnected through functional electrotonic synapses. Inhibitory synaptic potentials generated from single interneurons are sufficiently powerful  to delay or entirely block the generation of action potentials in a large number  of projection neurons simultaneously.", "28808012": "Chronic cocaine use is associated with prominent morphological changes in nucleus accumbens shell (NACsh) neurons, including increases in dendritic spine density along with enhanced motivation for cocaine, but a functional relationship between these morphological and behavioral phenomena has not been shown. Here we show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling through tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) receptors in NACsh neurons is necessary for cocaine-induced dendritic spine formation by using either localized TrkB knockout or viral-mediated expression of a dominant negative, kinase-dead TrkB mutant. Interestingly, augmenting wild-type TrkB expression after chronic cocaine self-administration reverses the sustained increase in dendritic spine density, an effect mediated by TrkB signaling pathways that converge on extracellular regulated kinase. Loss of  TrkB function after cocaine self-administration, however, leaves spine density intact but markedly enhances the motivation for cocaine, an effect mediated by specific loss of TrkB signaling through phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLC\u03b31). Conversely, overexpression of PLC\u03b31 both reduces the motivation for cocaine and reverses dendritic spine density, suggesting a potential target for the treatment of addiction in chronic users. Together, these findings indicate that BDNF-TrkB signaling both mediates and reverses cocaine-induced increases in dendritic spine density in NACsh neurons, and these morphological changes are entirely dissociable from changes in addictive behavior.", "27112496": "Repeated administration of cocaine results in the development of behavioral sensitization, accompanied by a decrease in excitatory synaptic strength in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) through an unknown mechanism. Furthermore, glial cells in the NAc are activated by drugs of abuse, but the contribution of glia to the development of addictive behaviors is unknown. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), an inflammatory cytokine released by activated glia, can drive the internalization of synaptic AMPA receptors on striatal medium spiny neurons. Here we show that repeated administration of cocaine activates striatal microglia and  induces TNF-\u03b1 production, which in turn depresses glutamatergic synaptic strength in the NAc core and limits the development of behavioral sensitization. Critically, following a period of abstinence, a weak TLR4 agonist can reactivate  microglia, increase TNF-\u03b1 production, depress striatal synaptic strength, and suppress cocaine-induced sensitization. Thus, cytokine signaling from microglia can regulate both the induction and expression of drug-induced behaviors.", "24259563": "The transcription factor, \u0394FosB, is robustly and persistently induced in striatum by several chronic stimuli, such as drugs of abuse, antipsychotic drugs, natural  rewards, and stress. However, very few studies have examined the degree of \u0394FosB  induction in the two striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes. We make use of  fluorescent reporter BAC transgenic mice to evaluate induction of \u0394FosB in dopamine receptor 1 (D1) enriched and dopamine receptor 2 (D2) enriched MSNs in ventral striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and core, and in dorsal striatum  (dStr) after chronic exposure to several drugs of abuse including cocaine, ethanol, \u0394(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, and opiates; the antipsychotic drug, haloperidol; juvenile enrichment; sucrose drinking; calorie restriction; the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, fluoxetine; and social defeat stress. Our findings demonstrate that chronic exposure to many stimuli induces \u0394FosB in an MSN-subtype selective pattern across all three striatal regions. To explore the circuit-mediated induction of \u0394FosB in striatum, we use optogenetics to enhance activity in limbic brain regions that send synaptic inputs to NAc; these regions include the ventral tegmental area and several glutamatergic afferent regions: medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and ventral hippocampus. These optogenetic conditions lead to highly distinct patterns of \u0394FosB induction in MSN subtypes in NAc core and shell. Together, these findings establish selective patterns of \u0394FosB induction in striatal MSN subtypes in response to chronic stimuli and provide novel insight into the circuit-level mechanisms of \u0394FosB induction in striatum.", "23745104": "Exposure to psychostimulants results in structural and synaptic plasticity in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). These cellular adaptations arise from alterations in genes that are highly implicated in the rearrangement of the actin-cytoskeleton, such as T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1). Previous studies have demonstrated a crucial role for dopamine receptor 1 (D1)-containing striatal MSNs in mediating psychostimulant induced plasticity changes. These D1-MSNs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) positively regulate drug seeking, reward, and locomotor behavioral effects as well as the morphological adaptations of psychostimulant drugs. Here, we demonstrate that rats that actively self-administer cocaine display reduced levels of Tiam1 in the NAc. To further examine the cell type-specific contribution to these changes in Tiam1 we  used optogenetics to selectively manipulate NAc D1-MSNs or dopamine receptor 2 (D2) expressing MSNs. We find that repeated channelrhodopsin-2 activation of D1-MSNs but not D2-MSNs caused a down-regulation of Tiam1 levels similar to the effects of cocaine. Further, activation of D2-MSNs, which caused a late blunted cocaine-mediated locomotor behavioral response, did not alter Tiam1 levels. We then examined the contribution of D1-MSNs to the cocaine-mediated decrease of Tiam1. Using the light activated chloride pump, eNpHR3.0 (enhanced Natronomonas pharaonis halorhodopsin 3.0), we selectively inhibited D1-MSNs during cocaine exposure, which resulted in a behavioral blockade of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Moreover, inhibiting these NAc D1-MSNs during cocaine exposure reversed the down-regulation of Tiam1 gene expression and protein levels. These data demonstrate that altering activity in specific neural circuits with optogenetics can impact the underlying molecular substrates of psychostimulant-mediated behavior and function.", "22957495": "Cocaine dependence involves in the brain's reward circuit as well as nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key region of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. Many studies have documented altered expression of genes and identified transcription factor networks and epigenetic processes that are fundamental to cocaine addiction. However, all these investigations have focused on mRNA of encoding genes, which may not always reflect the involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which has been implied in a broad range of biological processes and complex diseases including brain development and neuropathological process. To explore the potential involvement of lncRNAs in drug addiction, which is viewed as a form of  aberrant neuroplasticity, we used a custom-designed microarray to examine the expression profiles of mRNAs and lncRNAs in brain NAc of cocaine-conditioned mice and identified 764 mRNAs, and 603 lncRNAs were differentially expressed. Candidate lncRNAs were identified for further genomic context characterization as sense-overlap, antisense-overlap, intergenic, bidirection, and ultra-conserved region encoding lncRNAs. We found that 410 candidate lncRNAs which have been reported to act in cis or trans to their targeted loci, providing 48 pair mRNA-lncRNAs. These results suggest that the modification of mRNAs expression by  cocaine may be associated with the actions of lncRNAs. Taken together, our results show that cocaine can cause the genome-wide alterations of lncRNAs expressed in NAc, and some of these modified RNA transcripts may to play a role in cocaine-induced neural plasticity and addiction.", "21289199": "Cocaine induces plasticity at glutamatergic synapses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Withdrawal was suggested to play an important role in the development of this plasticity by studies showing that some changes only appear several weeks after the final cocaine exposure. In this study, the requirement for prolonged withdrawal was evaluated by comparing the changes in glutamatergic transmission induced by two different noncontingent cocaine treatments: a short treatment followed by prolonged withdrawal, and a longer treatment without prolonged withdrawal. Recordings were performed from mouse medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc at the same time after the first cocaine injection under both treatments. A similar increase in the frequency of glutamate-mediated miniature EPSCs was observed in D(1)-expressing MSNs after both cocaine treatments, demonstrating that prolonged withdrawal was not required. Furthermore, larger AMPA receptor-to-NMDA receptor ratios, higher spine density, and enlarged spine heads  were observed in the absence of withdrawal after a long cocaine treatment. These  synaptic adaptations expressed in D(1)-containing MSNs of the NAc core were not further enhanced by protracted withdrawal. In conclusion, a few repeated cocaine  injections are enough to trigger adaptations at glutamatergic synapses in D(1)-expressing MSNs, which, although they take time to develop, do not require prolonged cocaine withdrawal.", "20201846": "A growing body of evidence indicates that repeated exposure to cocaine leads to profound changes in glutamate transmission in limbic nuclei, particularly the nucleus accumbens. This review focuses on preclinical studies of cocaine-induced  behavioral plasticity, including behavioral sensitization, self-administration, and the reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Behavioral, pharmacological, neurochemical, electrophysiological, biochemical, and molecular biological changes associated with cocaine-induced plasticity in glutamate systems are reviewed. The ultimate goal of these lines of research is to identify novel targets for the development of therapies for cocaine craving and addiction. Therefore, we also outline the progress and prospects of glutamate modulators for the treatment of cocaine addiction.", "19295158": "Although chronic cocaine-induced changes in dendritic spines on nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons have been correlated with behavioral sensitization, the molecular pathways governing these structural changes, and their resulting behavioral effects, are poorly understood. The transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B  (NFkappaB), is rapidly activated by diverse stimuli and regulates expression of many genes known to maintain cell structure. Therefore, we evaluated the role of  NFkappaB in regulating cocaine-induced dendritic spine changes on medium spiny neurons of the NAc and the rewarding effects of cocaine. We show that chronic cocaine induces NFkappaB-dependent transcription in the NAc of NFkappaB-Lac transgenic mice. This induction of NFkappaB activity is accompanied by increased  expression of several NFkappaB genes, the promoters of which show chromatin modifications after chronic cocaine exposure consistent with their transcriptional activation. To study the functional significance of this induction, we used viral-mediated gene transfer to express either a constitutively active or dominant-negative mutant of Inhibitor of kappa B kinase  (IKKca or IKKdn), which normally activates NFkappaB signaling, in the NAc. We found that activation of NFkappaB by IKKca increases the number of dendritic spines on NAc neurons, whereas inhibition of NFkappaB by IKKdn decreases basal dendritic spine number and blocks the increase in dendritic spines after chronic  cocaine. Moreover, inhibition of NFkappaB blocks the rewarding effects of cocaine and the ability of previous cocaine exposure to increase an animal's preference for cocaine. Together, these studies establish a direct role for NFkappaB pathways in the NAc to regulate structural and behavioral plasticity to cocaine.", "19136971": "Cocaine addiction is characterized by an impaired ability to develop adaptive behaviors that can compete with cocaine seeking, implying a deficit in the ability to induce plasticity in cortico-accumbens circuitry crucial for regulating motivated behavior. We found that rats withdrawn from cocaine self-administration had a marked in vivo deficit in the ability to develop long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the nucleus accumbens core subregion after stimulation of the prefrontal cortex. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment prevents relapse in animal models and craving in humans by activating cystine-glutamate exchange and thereby stimulating extrasynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR). NAC treatment of rats restored the ability to induce LTP and LTD by indirectly stimulating mGluR2/3 and mGluR5, respectively. Our findings show that cocaine self-administration induces  metaplasticity that inhibits further induction of synaptic plasticity, and this impairment can be reversed by NAC, a drug that also prevents relapse.", "19013281": "The cellular heterogeneity of the brain confounds efforts to elucidate the biological properties of distinct neuronal populations. Using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice that express EGFP-tagged ribosomal protein L10a in defined cell populations, we have developed a methodology for affinity purification of polysomal mRNAs from genetically defined cell populations in the brain. The utility of this approach is illustrated by the comparative analysis of four types of neurons, revealing hundreds of genes that distinguish these four cell populations. We find that even two morphologically indistinguishable, intermixed subclasses of medium spiny neurons display vastly different translational profiles and present examples of the physiological significance of such differences. This genetically targeted translating ribosome  affinity purification (TRAP) methodology is a generalizable method useful for the identification of molecular changes in any genetically defined cell type in response to genetic alterations, disease, or pharmacological perturbations.", "17652583": "Plasticity of glutamatergic synapses is a fundamental mechanism through which experience changes neural function to impact future behavior. In animal models of addiction, glutamatergic signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) exerts powerful control over drug-seeking behavior. However, little is known about whether, how or when experience with drugs may trigger synaptic plasticity in this key nucleus. Using whole-cell synaptic physiology in NAc brain slices, we demonstrate that a progression of bidirectional changes in glutamatergic synaptic strength occurs after repeated in vivo exposure to cocaine. During a protracted drug-free  period, NAc neurons from cocaine-experienced mice develop a robust potentiation of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. However, a single re-exposure to cocaine during extended withdrawal becomes a potent stimulus for synaptic depression, abruptly reversing the initial potentiation. These enduring modifications in AMPAR-mediated responses and plasticity may provide a neural substrate for disrupted processing of drug-related stimuli in drug-experienced individuals.", "17618281": "A single exposure to cocaine rapidly induces the brief activation of several immediate early genes, but the role of such short-term regulation in the enduring consequences of cocaine use is poorly understood. We found that 4 h of intravenous cocaine self-administration in rats induced a transient increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of TrkB-mediated signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Augmenting this dynamic regulation with five daily NAc BDNF infusions caused enduring increases in cocaine self-administration, and facilitated relapse to cocaine seeking in withdrawal. In contrast, neutralizing endogenous BDNF regulation with intra-NAc infusions of antibody to BDNF subsequently reduced cocaine self-administration and attenuated  relapse. Using localized inducible BDNF knockout in mice, we found that BDNF originating from NAc neurons was necessary for maintaining increased cocaine self-administration. These findings suggest that dynamic induction and release of BDNF from NAc neurons during cocaine use promotes the development and persistence of addictive behavior.", "16207873": "Regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking is important for many forms of neuronal plasticity. In this study, a protein cross-linking assay was used to evaluate the contribution of AMPA receptor trafficking to plasticity associated with behavioral sensitization, an animal model of drug addiction. Cross-linking was used to distinguish between cell surface and intracellular AMPA receptors in nucleus accumbens (NAc) tissue obtained from rats treated repeatedly with saline  or cocaine. Surface/intracellular (S/I) ratios for glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) and GluR2/3 subunits were increased 21 d after the last injection in cocaine-sensitized rats but not rats that failed to sensitize, and the magnitude  of the S/I ratio for cocaine-sensitized rats was positively correlated with the magnitude of behavioral sensitization. At the 1 d withdrawal time, cocaine did not alter S/I ratios, and there was no correlation between S/I ratios and behavioral sensitization. The majority of surface-expressed GluR1 detected with this assay was associated with synapses, based on coimmunoprecipitation with postsynaptic density protein of 95 kDa. These findings suggest that behavioral sensitization to cocaine is associated with a slowly developing redistribution of AMPA receptors to the surface of NAc neurons. Motor execution of drug-seeking responses depends on activation of AMPA receptors on NAc neurons by glutamate afferents originating in cortical and limbic regions. We propose that drug-seeking responses are more effectively triggered in cocaine-sensitized rats  because of increased cell surface expression of AMPA receptors.", "15266353": "The effect of previous exposure to psychostimulants on the subsequent self-administration of cocaine as well as reinstatement of this behavior by priming infusions of AMPA into the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) was examined. Rats were exposed to five injections, one injection every third day, of either saline  or amphetamine (AMPH: 1.5 mg/kg, i.p.). Starting 10 days later, they were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.3 mg/kg/infusion, i.v.) and subsequently tested under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule for 4 consecutive days. As expected, rats exposed to AMPH worked more and obtained more cocaine infusions than saline exposed controls on the PR test sessions. Following daily extinction sessions during which saline was substituted for cocaine, the effect of priming infusions  of AMPA (0.0, 0.08, or 0.8 nmol/0.5 microl/side) into the NAcc was then examined  on two tests: one conducted 4 days after the last cocaine PR test session (2-3 weeks after the last AMPH exposure injection) and the next 4 weeks later. Consistent with previous reports, NAcc AMPA dose-dependently reinstated cocaine seeking on both tests regardless of exposure condition. Importantly, this priming effect of NAcc AMPA was significantly enhanced in AMPH compared to saline exposed rats on the first test conducted 2-3 weeks after AMPH. On the second test, conducted 4 weeks after cocaine, reinstatement was similarly enhanced in both groups to levels observed on the first test in AMPH exposed rats. These results indicate that both noncontingent (AMPH) and contingent (cocaine) exposure to psychostimulants enhances the reinstatement of cocaine seeking by NAcc AMPA and appears to do so in a time-dependent manner.", "12390532": "The goal of this study was to understand how dopamine receptors, which are activated during psychostimulant administration, might influence glutamate-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity that are increasingly recognized as important to drug addiction. Regulation of the surface expression of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor subunit GluR1 plays a critical role in long-term potentiation, a well-characterized form  of synaptic plasticity. Primary cultures of rat nucleus accumbens neurons were used to examine whether dopamine receptor stimulation influences cell surface expression of GluR1, detected using antibody to the extracellular portion of GluR1 and fluorescence microscopy. Surface GluR1 labeling on processes of medium  spiny neurons and interneurons was increased by brief (5-15 min) incubation with  a D1 agonist (1 microm SKF 81297). This effect was attenuated by the D1 receptor  antagonist SCH 23390 (10 microm) and reproduced by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (10 microm). Labeling was decreased by glutamate (10-50 microm, 15 min). These results are the first to demonstrate modulation of AMPA receptor surface expression by a non-glutamatergic G protein-coupled receptor. Normally, this may enable ongoing regulation of AMPA receptor transmission in response to changes in the activity of dopamine projections to the nucleus accumbens. When dopamine receptors are over-stimulated during chronic drug administration, this regulation may be disrupted, leading to inappropriate plasticity in neuronal circuits governing motivation and reward.", "8778304": "Rats were pretreated with daily cocaine or saline injections for 1 week. The rats treated with daily cocaine were separated into two groups: a sensitized group of  animals demonstrating > 20% increase in motor activity on the last injection compared with the first injection of daily cocaine, and a nonsensitized group showing < 20% elevation. At 2-3 weeks after the last daily injection, four experiments were performed to assess changes in excitatory amino acid (EAA) transmission in the nucleus accumbens produced by repeated cocaine administration. (1) Rats were challenged with a microinjection of AMPA into the shell or core of the nucleus accumbens. The sensitized rats demonstrated greater  motor activity than did the saline-pretreated or nonsensitized animals after AMPA injection into either subnucleus. (2) It was shown that the behavioral distinction between sensitized, nonsensitized, and control rats in behavioral responsiveness to AMPA was not mediated by differences in AMPA-induced dopamine release. (3) The extracellular content of glutamate was measured after a cocaine  challenge given at 21 d of withdrawal. Cocaine elevated the levels of glutamate in the core of sensitized rats, but not of nonsensitized or control rats. (4) Microinjection of the non-NMDA antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione into the core abolished the augmented motor response to a cocaine challenge in sensitized rats, but was without effect on cocaine-induced motor activity in nonsensitized animals.

Here, we use optogenetics, electrophysiology, and RNA-sequencing to characterize the transcriptome and functioning of NAc somatostatin interneurons after repeated exposure to cocaine. We find that the activity of somatostatin interneurons regulates behavioral responses to cocaine,  with repeated cocaine reducing the excitability of these neurons. Repeated cocaine also induces transcriptome-wide changes in gene expression within NAc somatostatin interneurons. We identify the JUND transcription factor as a key regulator of cocaine action and confirmed, by use of viral-mediated gene transfer, that JUND activity in somatostatin interneurons influences behavioral responses to cocaine. Our results identify alterations in NAc induced by cocaine  in a sparse population of somatostatin interneurons, and illustrate the value of  studying brain diseases using cell type-specific whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing.", "30038277": "Author information:  (1)Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA. bts@umn.edu.

This presents a problem: how can target cells know whether increased dopamine is a signal to learn or to move? It is often presumed that motivation involves slow ('tonic') dopamine changes, while fast ('phasic') dopamine fluctuations convey reward prediction errors for learning. Yet recent studies have shown that dopamine conveys motivational value and promotes movement even on subsecond timescales. Here I describe an alternative account of how dopamine regulates ongoing behavior. Dopamine release related to motivation is rapidly and locally sculpted  by receptors on dopamine terminals, independently from dopamine cell firing. Target neurons abruptly switch between learning and performance modes, with striatal cholinergic interneurons providing one candidate switch mechanism. The behavioral impact of dopamine varies by subregion, but in each case dopamine provides a dynamic estimate of whether it is worth expending a limited internal resource, such as energy, attention, or time.", "29339486": "Behavioral coping strategies are critical for active resilience to stress and depression; here we describe a role for neuroligin-2 (NLGN-2) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Neuroligins (NLGN) are a family of neuronal postsynaptic cell adhesion proteins that are constituents of the excitatory and inhibitory synapse. Importantly, NLGN-3 and NLGN-4 mutations are strongly implicated as candidates underlying the development of neuropsychiatric disorders with social disturbances such as autism, but the role of NLGN-2 in neuropsychiatric disease states is unclear. Here we show a reduction in NLGN-2 gene expression in the NAc of patients with major depressive disorder. Chronic social defeat stress in mice also decreases NLGN-2 selectively in dopamine D1-positive cells, but not dopamine D2-positive cells, within the NAc of stress-susceptible mice. Functional NLGN-2 knockdown produces bidirectional, cell-type-specific effects: knockdown in dopamine D1-positive cells promotes subordination and stress susceptibility, whereas knockdown in dopamine D2-positive cells mediates active defensive behavior. These findings establish a behavioral role for NAc NLGN-2 in stress and depression; provide a basis for targeted, cell-type specific therapy; and highlight the role of active behavioral coping mechanisms in stress susceptibility.", "28957664": "Individuals suffering from substance-use disorders develop strong associations between the drug's rewarding effects and environmental cues, creating powerful, enduring triggers for relapse. We found that dephosphorylated, nuclear histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) reduced cocaine reward-context associations and relapse-like behaviors in a cocaine self-administration model. We also discovered that HDAC5 associates with an activity-sensitive enhancer of the Npas4 gene and negatively regulates NPAS4 expression. Exposure to cocaine and the test chamber induced rapid and transient  NPAS4 expression in a small subpopulation of FOS-positive neurons in the NAc. Conditional deletion of Npas4 in the NAc significantly reduced cocaine conditioned place preference and delayed learning of the drug-reinforced action during cocaine self-administration, without affecting cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. These data suggest that HDAC5 and NPAS4 in the NAc are critically involved in reward-relevant learning and memory processes and that nuclear HDAC5 limits reinstatement of drug seeking independent of NPAS4.", "27911750": "Signals of energy homeostasis interact closely with neural circuits of motivation to control food intake. An emerging hypothesis is that the transition to maladaptive feeding behavior seen in eating disorders or obesity may arise from dysregulation of these interactions. Focusing on key brain regions involved in the control of food intake (ventral tegmental area, striatum, hypothalamus, and thalamus), we describe how activity of specific cell types embedded within these  regions can influence distinct components of motivated feeding behavior. We review how signals of energy homeostasis interact with these regions to influence motivated behavioral output and present evidence that experience-dependent neural adaptations in key feeding circuits may represent cellular correlates of impaired food intake control. Future research into mechanisms that restore the balance of  control between signals of homeostasis and motivated feeding behavior may inspire new treatment options for eating disorders and obesity.", "27710792": "The striatum, the entry nucleus of the basal ganglia, lacks laminar or columnar organization of its principal cells; nevertheless, functional data suggest that it is spatially organized. Here we examine whether the connectivity and synaptic  organization of striatal GABAergic interneurons contributes to\u00a0such spatial organization. Focusing on the two\u00a0main classes of striatal GABAergic interneurons (fast-spiking interneurons [FSIs] and low-threshold-spiking interneurons [LTSIs]), we apply a combination of optogenetics and viral tracing approaches to  dissect striatal microcircuits in mice. Our results reveal fundamental differences between the synaptic organizations of both interneuron types. FSIs target exclusively striatal projection neurons (SPNs) within close proximity and  form strong synapses on the\u00a0proximal somatodendritic region. In contrast, LTSIs target both SPNs and cholinergic interneurons, and synaptic connections onto SPNs are made exclusively over long distances and onto distal\u00a0dendrites. These results suggest fundamentally different functions of FSIs and LTSIs in shaping striatal output.", "26595651": "Dopamine cell firing can encode errors in reward prediction, providing a learning signal to guide future behavior. Yet dopamine is also a key modulator of motivation, invigorating current behavior. Existing theories propose that fast (phasic) dopamine fluctuations support learning, whereas much slower (tonic) dopamine changes are involved in motivation. We examined dopamine release in the  nucleus accumbens across multiple time scales, using complementary microdialysis  and voltammetric methods during adaptive decision-making. We found that minute-by-minute dopamine levels covaried with reward rate and motivational vigor. Second-by-second dopamine release encoded an estimate of temporally discounted future reward (a value function). Changing dopamine immediately altered willingness to work and reinforced preceding action choices by encoding temporal-difference reward prediction errors. Our results indicate that dopamine  conveys a single, rapidly evolving decision variable, the available reward for investment of effort, which is employed for both learning and motivational functions.", "24908491": "The ventromedial striatum (VMS) is a node in circuits underpinning both affect and reinforcement learning. The cellular bases of these functions and especially  their potential linkages have been unclear. VMS cholinergic interneurons, however, have been singled out as being related both to affect and to reinforcement-based conditioning, raising the possibility that unique aspects of  their signaling could account for these functions. Here we show that VMS tonically active neurons (TANs), including putative cholinergic interneurons, generate unique bidirectional outcome responses during reward-based learning, reporting both positive (reward) and negative (reward omission) outcomes when behavioral change is prompted by switches in reinforcement contingencies. VMS output neurons (SPNs), by contrast, are nearly insensitive to switches in reinforcement contingencies, gradually losing outcome signaling while maintaining responses at trial initiation and goal approach. Thus, TANs and SPNs in the VMS provide distinct signals optimized for different aspects of the learning process.", "24413699": "Author information:  (1)1] Center for Neurobehavioral Genetics, Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.

Such studies have demonstrated that activation of reward circuitry during social interactions facilitates pair bond formation. Within this circuitry, \u03bc-opioid receptors (MORs) modulate naturally rewarding behavior in an anatomically segregated manner; MORs  located throughout the striatum (dorsal striatum, NAc core, and the entire NAc shell) are implicated in general motivational processes, whereas those located specifically within the dorsomedial NAc shell mediate positive hedonics (and are  referred to as a \"hedonic hotspot\"). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether MORs within these distinct subregions differentially mediate pair bond formation. We first used receptor autoradiography to compare MOR binding densities between these regions. MOR binding was significantly higher in  the NAc core and dorsomedial NAc shell compared with the ventral NAc shell. We next used partner preference testing to determine whether MORs within these subregions differentially mediate pair bonding. Blockade of MORs using 1 or 3 \u03bcg  of H-d-Phe-Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 within the dorsal striatum decreased mating during the cohabitation period and inhibited partner preference formation. In contrast, blockade of MORs within dorsomedial NAc shell inhibited partner preference formation without effecting mating behavior, whereas other regions were not involved. Thus, MORs within the dorsal striatum mediate partner preference formation via impairment of mating, whereas those in the dorsomedial NAc shell appear to mediate pair bond formation through the positive hedonics associated with mating.", "23261404": "Ann Kelley was a scientific pioneer in reward neuroscience. Her many notable discoveries included demonstrations of accumbens/striatal circuitry roles in eating behavior and in food reward, explorations of limbic interactions with hypothalamic regulatory circuits, and additional interactions of motivation circuits with learning functions. Ann Kelley's accomplishments inspired other researchers to follow in her footsteps, including our own laboratory group. Here  we describe results from several lines of our research that sprang in part from earlier findings by Kelley and colleagues. We describe hedonic hotspots for generating intense pleasure 'liking', separate identities of 'wanting' versus 'liking' systems, a novel role for dorsal neostriatum in generating motivation to eat, a limbic keyboard mechanism in nucleus accumbens for generating intense desire versus intense dread, and dynamic limbic transformations of learned memories into motivation. We describe how origins for each of these themes can be traced to fundamental contributions by Ann Kelley.", "22273000": "The striatum can be divided into the DLS (dorsolateral striatum) and the VMS (ventromedial striatum), which includes NAcC (nucleus accumbens core) and NAcS (nucleus accumbens shell). Here, we examined differences in electrophysiological  properties of MSSNs (medium-sized spiny neurons) based on their location, expression of DA (dopamine) D1/D2 receptors and responses to the \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist, DAMGO {[D-Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(ol)(5)]enkephalin}. The main differences in morphological and biophysical membrane properties occurred among striatal sub-regions. MSSNs in the DLS were larger, had higher membrane capacitances and lower Rin (input resistances) compared with cells in the VMS. RMPs (resting membrane potentials) were similar among regions except for D2 cells in the NAcC, which displayed a significantly more depolarized RMP. In contrast, differences in frequency of spontaneous excitatory synaptic inputs were more prominent between cell types, with D2 cells receiving significantly more excitatory inputs than D1 cells, particularly in the VMS. Inhibitory inputs were  not different between D1 and D2 cells. However, MSSNs in the VMS received more inhibitory inputs than those in the DLS. Acute application of DAMGO reduced the frequency of spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, but the effect was greater in the VMS, in particular in the NAcS, where excitatory currents from D2 cells and inhibitory currents from D1 cells were inhibited by the largest amount. DAMGO also increased cellular excitability in the VMS, as shown by reduced threshold for evoking APs (action potentials). Together the present findings help elucidate the regional and cell-type-specific substrate of  opioid actions in the striatum and point to the VMS as a critical mediator of DAMGO effects.", "22245501": "The nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS) has been implicated in controlling stress responses through corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF). In addition to studies indicating that CRF in the NAcS increases appetitive motivation, there is indirect evidence suggesting that NAcS CRF may also cause aversive responses and  that these behaviors may be mediated through local dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) systems. To provide a direct test of this hypothesis, we used male Sprague-Dawley rats with implanted cannulas aimed at the NAcS. Experiment 1  showed local CRF injection (10 or 50 ng/side) to increase immobility in the forced swim test and a CRF antagonist D-Phe-CRF ((12-41)) to attenuate this depressive-like behavior. In Experiment 2, injection of CRF (250 ng/side) also decreased the rats' preference for sucrose, while in Experiment 3, CRF (50 or 250 ng/side) induced anxiety-like behaviors in an elevated plus maze and open field.  These same doses of CRF in Experiment 4 failed to alter the rats' locomotor activity, indicating that these behavioral changes were not caused by deficits in activity. In Experiment 5, results from in vivo microdialysis revealed that CRF in the NAcS markedly increased local extracellular ACh, while also producing a small increase in DA. These results show that NAcS CRF can generate a variety of  aversive behaviors, including swim depression, anhedonia, and anxiety, in addition to approach behavior. They suggest that these behaviors may occur, in part, through enhanced activation of ACh and DA in the NAcS, respectively, supporting a role for this brain area in mediating the dual effects of stress.", "21368037": "Frontal cortical regions are activated by food-associated stimuli, and this activation appears to be dysregulated in individuals with eating disorders. Nevertheless, frontal control of basic unconditioned feeding responses remains poorly understood. Here we show that hyperphagia can be driven by \u03bc-opioid receptor stimulation in restricted regions of ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex. In both ad libitum-fed and food-restricted male Sprague Dawley rats, bilateral infusions of the \u03bc-opioid agonist [d-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) markedly increased intake of standard rat  chow. When given a choice between palatable fat-enriched versus carbohydrate-enriched test diets, intra-vmPFC DAMGO infusions selectively increased carbohydrate intake, even in rats with a baseline fat preference. Rats  also exhibited motor hyperactivity characterized by rapid switching between brief bouts of investigatory and ingestive behaviors. Intra-vmPFC DAMGO affected neither water intake nor nonspecific oral behavior. Similar DAMGO infusions into  neighboring areas of lateral orbital or anterior motor cortex had minimal effects on feeding. Neither stimulation of vmPFC-localized \u03b4-opioid, \u03ba-opioid, dopaminergic, serotonergic, or noradrenergic receptors, nor antagonism of D1, 5HT1A, or \u03b1- or \u03b2-adrenoceptors, reproduced the profile of DAMGO effects. Muscimol-mediated inactivation of the vmPFC, and intra-vmPFC stimulation of \u03ba-opioid receptors or blockade of 5-HT2A (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A) receptors, suppressed motor activity and increased feeding bout duration-a profile opposite to that seen with DAMGO. Hence, \u03bc-opioid-induced hyperphagia and carbohydrate intake can be elicited with remarkable pharmacological and behavioral specificity from discrete subterritories of the frontal cortex. These  findings may have implications for understanding affect-driven feeding and loss of restraint in eating disorders.", "21164015": "Cholinergic neurons are widespread, and pharmacological modulation of acetylcholine receptors affects numerous brain processes, but such modulation entails side effects due to limitations in specificity for receptor type and target cell. As a result, causal roles of cholinergic neurons in circuits have been unclear. We integrated optogenetics, freely moving mammalian behavior, in vivo electrophysiology, and slice physiology to probe the cholinergic interneurons of the nucleus accumbens by direct excitation or inhibition. Despite representing less than 1% of local neurons, these cholinergic cells have dominant control roles, exerting powerful modulation of circuit activity. Furthermore, these neurons could be activated by cocaine, and silencing this drug-induced activity during cocaine exposure (despite the fact that the manipulation of the cholinergic interneurons was not aversive by itself) blocked cocaine conditioning in freely moving mammals.", "20203210": "The intrastriatal microcircuit is a predominantly inhibitory GABAergic network comprised of a majority of projection neurons [medium spiny neurons (MSNs)] and a minority of interneurons. The connectivity within this microcircuit is divided into two main categories: lateral connectivity between MSNs, and inhibition mediated by interneurons, in particular fast spiking (FS) cells. To understand the operation of striatum, it is essential to have a good description of the dynamic properties of these respective pathways and how they affect different types of striatal projection neurons. We recorded from neuronal pairs, triplets,  and quadruplets in slices of rat and mouse striatum and analyzed the dynamics of  synaptic transmission between MSNs and FS cells. Retrograde fluorescent labeling  and transgenic EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) mice were used to distinguish between MSNs of the direct (striatonigral) and indirect (striatopallidal) pathways. Presynaptic neurons were stimulated with trains of action potentials, and activity-dependent depression and facilitation of synaptic efficacy was recorded from postsynaptic neurons. We found that FS cells provide a strong and homogeneously depressing inhibition of both striatonigral and striatopallidal MSN types. Moreover, individual FS cells are connected to MSNs of both types. In contrast, both MSN types receive sparse and variable, depressing and facilitating synaptic transmission from nearby MSNs. The connection probability was higher for pairs with presynaptic striatopallidal MSNs; however,  the variability in synaptic dynamics did not depend on the types of interconnected MSNs. The differences between the two inhibitory pathways were clear in both species and at different developmental stages. Our findings show that the two intrastriatal inhibitory pathways have fundamentally different dynamic properties that are, however, similarly applied to both direct and indirect striatal projections.", "20044138": "Opioid signaling has been strongly implicated in driving palatable food consumption. The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is one important site of this effect; hyperphagia elicited by administration of exogenous mu opioid receptor (MOR) ligands in this brain region has been well documented. However, the role that endogenous opioid ligands in the NAcc play in controlling food intake remains poorly understood. Enkephalins, which signal through both the MOR and delta opioid receptor (DOR), are highly expressed within a subset of NAcc neurons, and  have been shown to be sensitive to manipulations of diet and motivation. To investigate a potential role for these signaling molecules in regulating palatability-driven consumption, we measured high fat chow intake in rats following a series of pharmacological manipulations of NAcc opioid signaling. NAcc infusion of the MOR agonist [D-Ala2, N-MePHe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) robustly increased palatable food intake, as has previously been demonstrated. In contrast, neither infusion of Met-enkephalin, its synthetic analogue [D-Ala2] Met-enkephalin (DALA) nor the DOR-specific ligand [D-Pen2, Pen5]-enkephalin (DPDPE) had significant effects on food intake. However, when administered in combination with DAMGO, DPDPE significantly suppressed the magnitude of DAMGO-evoked feeding. Further analysis of DPDPE effects revealed that the drug strongly increased locomotor activity. Suppressive effects on feeding, then, may  have occurred through competition between feeding and locomotion for behavioral expression.", "19597155": "It generally is assumed that a common neural substrate mediates both the palatability and the reward value of nutritive events. However, recent evidence suggests this assumption may not be true. Whereas opioid circuitry in both the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum has been reported to mediate taste-reactivity responses to palatable events, the assignment of reward or inventive value to goal-directed actions has been found to involve the basolateral amygdala. Here we found that, in rats, the neural processes mediating palatability and incentive value are indeed dissociable. Naloxone infused into either the ventral pallidum or nucleus accumbens shell blocked the increase in sucrose palatability induced by an increase in food deprivation without affecting the performance of sucrose-related actions. Conversely, naloxone infused into the basolateral amygdala blocked food deprivation-induced changes in sucrose-related  actions without affecting sucrose palatability. This double dissociation of opioid-mediated changes in palatability and incentive value suggests that the role of endogenous opioids in reward processing does not depend on a single neural circuit. Rather, changes in palatability and in the incentive value assigned to rewarding events seem to be mediated by distinct neural processes.", "19458221": "The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) helps translate learning into motivation, and here, we show that opioid stimulation of CeA magnifies and focuses learned incentive salience onto a specific reward cue (pavlovian conditioned stimulus, or CS). This motivation enhancement makes that cue more attractive, noticeable, and liable to elicit appetitive and consummatory behaviors. To reveal the focusing of incentive salience, we exploited individual  differences in an autoshaping paradigm in which a rat prefers to approach, nibble, and sniff one of two reward-associated stimuli (its prepotent stimulus).  The individually prepotent cue is either a predictive CS+ that signals reward (8  s metal lever insertion) or instead the metal cup that delivers sucrose pellets (the reward source). Results indicated that CeA opioid activation by microinjection of the mu agonist DAMGO (0.1 microg) selectively and reversibly enhanced the attractiveness of whichever reward CS was that rat's prepotent cue.  CeA DAMGO microinjections made rats more vigorously approach their particular prepotent CS and to energetically sniff and nibble it in a nearly frenzied consummatory manner. Only the prepotent cue was enhanced as an incentive target,  and alternative cues were not enhanced. Conversely, inactivation of CeA by muscimol microinjection (0.25 microg) suppressed approach, nibbles, and sniffs of the prepotent CS. Confirming modulation of incentive salience, unconditioned food intake was similarly increased by DAMGO microinjection and decreased by muscimol  in CeA. We conclude that opioid neurotransmission in CeA helps determine which environmental stimuli become most \"wanted,\" and how \"wanted\" they become. This may powerfully guide reward-seeking behavior.", "18829965": "Basal ganglia circuits make key contributions to decision making. Distributed, synchronous feedforward inhibition of striatal medium spiny neurons by fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons (FSIs) has been argued to be important for the suppression of unwanted actions, and a deficit in FSIs has been found in human patients with Tourette syndrome. However, no studies have yet examined how  striatal FSIs change their activity during behavioral tasks. Here I describe 36 presumed striatal FSIs recorded in rats during well practiced performance of a radial maze win-stay task. Although most FSIs showed robust task-related activity, the temporal patterns of firing rate change were highly idiosyncratic.  In contrast to other classes of striatal neurons, FSIs showed little or no coordinated population response to major task events such as instruction cues or  rewards. Even when multiple FSIs were recorded simultaneously from the same local region of striatum, firing rate changes were dissimilar, and no clear evidence for synchronous firing was found using cross-correlograms (18 FSI pairs examined). These results suggest that FSIs play a more complex role in the information processing achieved by striatal microcircuits than supposed by current theoretical models.", "18485497": "Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptides appear to modulate  various effects of psychostimulant drugs. Injections of CART peptide into the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) inhibit locomotion produced by systemic injections of the psychostimulants cocaine and amphetamine. Intra-NAcc injections of CART peptide also inhibit locomotion produced by microinfusions of dopamine into the NAcc, suggesting that the effects of CART peptides may be due to an interaction with the dopaminergic system in the NAcc. We sought to determine if this inhibitory effect of CART peptide generalizes to other measures of dopaminergic function such as reward/reinforcement by testing the effect of bilateral intra-NAcc CART infusions (0, 0.25, 1.0 and 2.5 microg per side) on cocaine and food self-administration. One group of rats self-administered cocaine (0.75 mg/kg per 140 microl IV infusion) on a progressive ratio schedule. A separate group received 45 mg food pellets on the same progressive ratio schedule. Bilateral intra-NAcc injections of CART peptide dose-dependently decreased the number of cocaine infusions, the breakpoint of cocaine self-administration, and the total number of bar presses on the cocaine-associated lever. There were no effects of CART injections on the breakpoint for food reward. Thus, we conclude that injections of CART into the NAcc appear to functionally antagonize a major site of action for cocaine self-administration in rats.", "18184783": "Stress is a complex human experience having both positive and negative motivational properties. When chronic and uncontrollable, the adverse effects of  stress on human health are considerable and yet poorly understood. Here, we report that the dysphoric properties of chronic stress are encoded by the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin acting on specific stress-related neuronal circuits. Using different forms of stress presumed to evoke dysphoria in mice, we found that repeated forced swim and inescapable footshock both produced aversive  behaviors that were blocked by a kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) antagonist and absent in mice lacking dynorphin. Injection of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) or urocortin III, key mediators of the stress response, produced place aversion that was also blocked by dynorphin gene deletion or KOR antagonism. CRF-induced place aversion was blocked by the CRF2 receptor antagonist antisauvigine-30, but not by the CRF1 receptor antagonist antalarmin. In contrast, place aversion induced by the KOR agonist U50,488 was not blocked by antisauvigine-30. These results suggest that the aversive effects of stress were  mediated by CRF2 receptor stimulation of dynorphin release and subsequent KOR activation. Using a phospho-selective antibody directed against the activated KOR to image sites of dynorphin action in the brain, we found that stress and CRF each caused dynorphin-dependent KOR activation in the basolateral amygdala, nucleus accumbens, dorsal raphe, and hippocampus. The convergence of stress-induced aversive inputs on the dynorphin system was unexpected, implicates dynorphin as a key mediator of dysphoria, and emphasizes kappa-receptor antagonists as promising therapeutics.", "18054796": "There are two distinct inhibitory GABAergic circuits in the neostriatum. The feedforward circuit consists of a relatively small population of GABAergic interneurons that receives excitatory input from the neocortex and exerts monosynaptic inhibition onto striatal spiny projection neurons. The feedback circuit comprises the numerous spiny projection neurons and their interconnections via local axon collaterals. This network has long been assumed to provide the majority of striatal GABAergic inhibition and to sharpen and shape striatal output through lateral inhibition, producing increased activity in the most strongly excited spiny cells at the expense of their less strongly excited neighbors. Recent results, mostly from recording experiments of synaptically connected pairs of neurons, have revealed that the two GABAergic circuits differ  markedly in terms of the total number of synapses made by each, the strength of the postsynaptic response detected at the soma, the extent of presynaptic convergence and divergence and the net effect of the activation of each circuit on the postsynaptic activity of the spiny neuron. These data have revealed that the feedforward inhibition is powerful and widespread, with spiking in a single interneuron being capable of significantly delaying or even blocking the generation of spikes in a large number of postsynaptic spiny neurons. In contrast, the postsynaptic effects of spiking in a single presynaptic spiny neuron on postsynaptic spiny neurons are weak when measured at the soma, and unable to significantly affect spike timing or generation. Further, reciprocity of synaptic connections between spiny neurons is only rarely observed. These results suggest that the bulk of the fast inhibition that has the strongest effects on spiny neuron spike timing comes from the feedforward interneuronal system whereas the axon collateral feedback system acts principally at the dendrites to control local excitability as well as the overall level of activity  of the spiny neuron.", "17301168": "Mu-opioid stimulation of cubic millimeter hedonic hotspots in either the nucleus  accumbens shell (NAc) or the ventral pallidum (VP) amplifies hedonic \"liking\" reactions to sweetness and appetitive \"wanting\" for food reward. How do these two NAc-VP hotspots interact? To probe their interaction and limbic circuit properties, we assessed whether opioid activation of one hotspot recruited the other hotspot (neurobiologically) and whether opioid hedonic and incentive motivational amplification by either opioid hotspot required permissive opioid coactivation in the other (behaviorally). We found that NAc and VP hotspots reciprocally modulated Fos expression in each other and that the two hotspots were needed together to enhance sucrose \"liking\" reactions, essentially cooperating within a single hedonic NAc-VP circuit. In contrast, the NAc hotspot  dominated for opioid stimulation of eating and food intake (\"wanting\"), independent of VP activation. This pattern reveals differences between limbic opioid circuits that control reward \"liking\" and \"wanting\" functions.", "16613600": "BACKGROUND: Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is typically considered to mediate aversive aspects of stress, fear and anxiety. However, CRF release in the brain is also elicited by natural rewards and incentive cues, raising the possibility that some CRF systems in the brain mediate an independent function of positive incentive motivation, such as amplifying incentive salience. Here we asked whether activation of a limbic CRF subsystem magnifies the increase in positive motivation for reward elicited by incentive cues previously associated with that reward, in a way that might exacerbate cue-triggered binge pursuit of food or other incentives? We assessed the impact of CRF microinjections into the  medial shell of nucleus accumbens using a pure incentive version of Pavlovian-Instrumental transfer, a measure specifically sensitive to the incentive salience of reward cues (which it separates from influences of aversive stress, stress reduction, frustration and other traditional explanations for stress-increased behavior). Rats were first trained to press one of two levers to obtain sucrose pellets, and then separately conditioned to associate a Pavlovian  cue with free sucrose pellets. On test days, rats received microinjections of vehicle, CRF (250 or 500 ng/0.2 microl) or amphetamine (20 microg/0.2 microl). Lever pressing was assessed in the presence or absence of the Pavlovian cues during a half-hour test. RESULTS: Microinjections of the highest dose of CRF (500 ng) or amphetamine (20 microg) selectively enhanced the ability of Pavlovian reward cues to trigger phasic peaks of increased instrumental performance for a sucrose reward, each peak lasting a minute or so before decaying after the cue. Lever pressing was not enhanced by CRF microinjections in the baseline absence of the Pavlovian cue or during the presentation without a cue, showing that the CRF enhancement could not be explained as a result of generalized motor arousal, frustration or stress, or  by persistent attempts to ameliorate aversive states. CONCLUSION: We conclude that CRF in nucleus accumbens shell amplifies positive motivation for cued rewards, in particular by magnifying incentive salience that  is attributed to Pavlovian cues previously associated with those rewards. CRF-induced magnification of incentive salience provides a novel explanation as to why stress may produce cue-triggered bursts of binge eating, drug addiction relapse, or other excessive pursuits of rewards.", "16354936": "Mu-opioid systems in the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens contribute to hedonic impact (\"liking\") for sweetness, food, and drug rewards. But does the entire medial shell generate reward hedonic impact? Or is there a specific localized site for opioid enhancement of hedonic \"liking\" in the medial shell? And how does enhanced taste hedonic impact relate to opioid-stimulated increases  in food intake? Here, we used a functional mapping procedure based on microinjection Fos plumes to localize opioid substrates in the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens that cause enhanced \"liking\" reactions to sweet pleasure and that stimulate food intake. We mapped changes in affective orofacial reactions of \"liking\"/\"disliking\" elicited by sucrose or quinine tastes after D-Ala2-N-Me-Phe4-Glycol5-enkephalin (DAMGO) microinjections in rats and compared  hedonic increases to food intake stimulated at the same sites. Our maps indicate  that opioid-induced increases in sucrose hedonic impact are generated by a localized cubic millimeter site in a rostrodorsal region of the medial shell. In  contrast, all regions of the medial shell generated DAMGO-induced robust increases in eating behavior and food intake. Thus, our results identify a locus  for opioid amplification of hedonic impact and reveal a distinction between opioid mechanisms of food intake and hedonic impact. Opioid circuits for stimulating food intake are widely distributed, whereas hedonic \"liking\" circuits are more tightly localized in the rostromedial shell of the nucleus accumbens.", "15979595": "Due to the nature of processing within the accumbens shell (AccSh) and the presence of orexin receptors and varicosities within the AccSh, we hypothesized that orexin A may partly regulate feeding behavior and locomotor activity via signaling in this site. To test this hypothesis, male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with guide cannulae directed to the medial portion of the AccSh. Orexin A (0, 100, 500, and 1000 pmol, in 0.5 microl artificial cerebrospinal fluid) was  infused into the AccSh and feeding behavior and locomotor activity were monitored. The effect of pretreatment with an orexin 1 receptor antagonist (SB334867A) on orexin A-induced feeding and locomotor activity was assessed. Orexin A augmented feeding in the 0-1 h and 1-2 h post-infusion interval (P = 0.0058 and P = 0.025, respectively) and stimulated locomotor activity in the 30-60 min, 60-90 min, and 90-120 min post-infusion intervals (P <or= 0.0001, P =  0.0056 and P = 0.046, respectively). Orexin A-induced feeding was significantly attenuated by preadministration of SB334867A in the 0-1 h post-infusion time interval (P = 0.03). Orexin A-induced locomotor activity was not affected by SB334867A. These data support the hypothesis that the AccSh is a site of orexin A modulation of feeding behavior and locomotor activity.", "15721244": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key component of the brain's reward pathway, yet little is known of how NAc cells respond to primary rewarding or aversive stimuli. Here, naive rats received brief intraoral infusions of sucrose and quinine paired with cues in a classical conditioning paradigm while the electrophysiological activity of individual NAc neurons was recorded. NAc neurons (102) were typically inhibited by sucrose (39 of 52, 75%) or excited by quinine (30 of 40, 75%) infusions. Changes in firing rate were correlated with the oromotor response to intraoral infusions. Most taste-responsive neurons responded to only one of the stimuli. NAc neurons developed responses to the cues paired with sucrose and quinine. Thus, NAc neurons are innately tuned to rewarding and aversive stimuli and rapidly develop responses to predictive cues. The results indicate that the output of the NAc is very different when rats taste rewarding versus aversive stimuli.", "15689556": "Obesity is a major public health problem. Palatability (i.e., the reinforcing value of food, derived from orosensory cues) is a significant factor in determining food intake and contributes to increased consumption leading to obesity. The nucleus accumbens is a ventral striatal region that is important for both appetitive and consummatory behaviors and has been implicated in modulating  palatability. In this study, we investigated palatability encoding in the firing  of nucleus accumbens neurons in rats. Nucleus accumbens neurons with significant  changes in firing rate during consummatory behavior displayed one of two principal firing patterns. Firing in one class of nucleus accumbens neurons was correlated with the palatability of sucrose reinforcers; changes in neural activity in this class consisted primarily of excitations. Within this group of neurons, a subset was sensitive to the relative value of sucrose reinforcers, as  assessed by a behavioral contrast paradigm. A second and distinct population of nucleus accumbens neurons, with changes in firing that were pre-dominantly inhibitions, was not sensitive to reinforcer palatability; rather, these inhibitions were present even during unreinforced bouts of licking. In addition,  the onset of these inhibitions typically occurred before the initiation of the licking behavior itself. We propose that two primary classes of nucleus accumbens neurons contribute to neural processing immediately before and during reinforcer  consumption: inhibitions related to initiation and maintenance of consummatory behaviors and excitations that encode reinforcer palatability.", "12898614": "A double-label immunohistochemical study was carried out to investigate overlap between dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DbetaH) -immunopositive projections and the projections of hypothalamic neurons containing the arousal- and feeding-related peptide, orexin/hypocretin (HCRT), in rat brain. Numerous intermingled HCRT-immunopositive and DbetaH-immunopositive fibers were seen in a ventrally situated corridor extending from the hypothalamus to deep layers of the infralimbic cortex. Both fiber types avoided the nucleus accumbens core, caudate  putamen, and the globus pallidus. In the diencephalon, overlap was observed in several hypothalamic areas, including the perifornical, dorsomedial, and paraventricular nuclei, as well as in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus. Intermingled HCRT-containing and DbetaH-containing fibers extended from the hypothalamus into areas within the medial and central amygdala, terminating at the medial border of the lateral subdivision of the central nucleus of the amygdala. Dense overlap between the two fiber types was also observed in the periaqueductal gray, particularly in the vicinity of the dorsal raphe, as well as (to a lesser extent) in the ventral tegmental area, the retrorubral field, and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. Hypocretin-containing cell bodies, located in the perifornical and lateral hypothalamus, were embedded within a dense plexus of DbetaH-immunopositive fibers and boutons, with numerous cases of  apparent contacts of DbetaH-containing boutons onto HCRT-immunopositive soma and  dendrites. HCRT-containing fibers were observed amid the noradrenergic cells of the locus coeruleus, and in the vicinity of the A1, A2, and A5 cell groups. Hence, the projections of these two arousal-related systems, originating in distinctly different parts of the brain, jointly target several forebrain regions and brainstem monoaminergic nuclei involved in regulating core motivational processes.", "12436423": "The neostriatum (dorsal striatum) is composed of the caudate and putamen. The ventral striatum is the ventral conjunction of the caudate and putamen that merges into and includes the nucleus accumbens and striatal portions of the olfactory tubercle. About 2% of the striatal neurons are cholinergic. Most cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system make diffuse projections that sparsely innervate relatively broad areas. In the striatum, however, the cholinergic neurons are interneurons that provide very dense local innervation. The cholinergic interneurons provide an ongoing acetylcholine (ACh) signal by firing action potentials tonically at about 5 Hz. A high concentration of acetylcholinesterase in the striatum rapidly terminates the ACh signal, and thereby minimizes desensitization of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Among the many muscarinic and nicotinic striatal mechanisms, the ongoing nicotinic activity potently enhances dopamine release. This process is among those in the striatum that link the two extensive and dense local arbors of the cholinergic interneurons and dopaminergic afferent fibers. During a conditioned motor task, cholinergic interneurons respond with a pause in their tonic firing. It is reasonable to hypothesize that this pause in the cholinergic activity alters action potential dependent dopamine release. The correlated response of these two broad and dense neurotransmitter systems helps to coordinate the output of the striatum, and is likely to be an important process in sensorimotor planning and learning.", "11035216": "There is a high coexistence of substance abuse in humans with eating disorders. One theory offered to account for this fact is that a common biochemical substrate may exist that mediates both processes. Brain neuropeptide Y (NPY) is one neurochemical system that might contribute to these separate, yet related, problems. To clarify the role of NPY in mediating reward processes and the possible interaction between reward and feeding, the present study examined the effects of injecting NPY bilaterally into the perifornical hypothalamus (PFH) vs. the nucleus accumbens (NAC) on intake of preferred vs. non-preferred food types,  as well as on conditioned place preference (CPP) learning. NPY (24, 78, 156 and 235 pmol/side) stimulated intake of both regular powdered chow and sucrose when injected into the PFH, but not the NAC. A CPP that was negatively correlated with food intake occurred with the low (24 pmol/side) dose of NPY in the PFH, while a  CPP that was not correlated with food intake was produced with the same dose in the NAC. The extent of the CPPs produced by NPY injection in both brain sites mirrored that produced by peripheral injection of amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg). These  results indicate that NPY elicits reward-related behavior, but not feeding, from  the NAC, and both behaviors from the PFH. However, the feeding effect derived from the PFH appears to overshadow a rewarding effect derived from this site. Considered together, these findings suggest that altered NPY functioning in both  brain regions may contribute to some of the pathophysiological processes observed in eating disordered patients who have additional proclivities for substance abuse.", "10973595": "The nucleus accumbens, and particularly its shell region, is a critical site at which feeding responses can be elicited following direct administration of opiate drugs as well as micro-selective and delta-selective, but not kappa-selective opioid receptor subtype agonists. In contrast to observations of selective and receptor-specific opioid antagonist effects upon corresponding agonist-induced actions in analgesic studies, ventricular administration of opioid receptor subtype antagonists blocks feeding induced by multiple opioid receptor subtype agonists. The present study examined whether feeding responses elicited by either putative mu ([D-Ala(2), NMe-Phe(4), Gly-ol(5)]-enkephalin (DAMGO)), delta(1) ([D-Pen(2), D-Pen(5)]-enkephalin (DPDPE)) or delta(2) ([D-Ala(2), Glu(4)]-deltorphin (Deltorphin)) opioid receptor subtype agonists administered into the nucleus accumbens shell were altered by accumbens pretreatment with either selective mu (beta-funaltrexamine), mu(1) (naloxonazine), delta(1) ([D-Ala(2), Leu(5), Cys(6)]-enkephalin (DALCE)), delta(2) (naltrindole isothiocyanate) or kappa(1) (nor-binaltorphamine) opioid receptor subtype antagonists. Similar magnitudes and durations of feeding responses were elicited  by bilateral accumbens administration of either DAMGO (2.5 microg), DPDPE (5 microg) or Deltorphin (5 microg). DAMGO-induced feeding in the nucleus accumbens  shell was significantly reduced by accumbens pretreatment of mu, delta(1), delta(2) and kappa(1), but not mu(1) opioid receptor subtype antagonists. DPDPE-induced feeding in the accumbens was significantly reduced by accumbens pretreatment of mu, delta(1), delta(2) and kappa(1), but not mu(1) opioid receptor subtype antagonists. Deltorphin-induced feeding in the accumbens was largely unaffected by accumbens delta(2) antagonist pretreatment, and was significantly enhanced by accumbens mu or kappa(1) antagonist pretreatment. These data indicate different opioid pharmacological profiles for feeding induced by putative mu, delta(1) and delta(2) opioid agonists in the nucleus accumbens shell, as well as the participation of multiple opioid receptor subtypes in the elicitation and maintenance of feeding by these agonists in the nucleus accumbens shell.", "10835636": "The role of the opioid system in controlling pain, reward and addiction is well established, but its role in regulating other emotional responses is poorly documented in pharmacology. The mu-, delta- and kappa- opioid receptors (encoded  by Oprm, Oprd1 and Oprk1, respectively) mediate the biological activity of opioids. We have generated Oprd1-deficient mice and compared the behavioural responses of mice lacking Oprd1, Oprm (ref. 6) and Oprk1 (ref. 7) in several models of anxiety and depression. Our data show no detectable phenotype in Oprk1-/- mutants, suggesting that kappa-receptors do not have a role in this aspect of opioid function; opposing phenotypes in Oprm-/- and Oprd1-/- mutants which contrasts with the classical notion of similar activities of mu- and delta-receptors; and consistent anxiogenic- and depressive-like responses in Oprd1-/- mice, indicating that delta-receptor activity contributes to improvement of mood states. We conclude that the Oprd1-encoded receptor, which has been proposed to be a promising target for the clinical management of pain, should also be considered in the treatment of drug addiction and other mood-related disorders.", "10773195": "Microinjection of opioid agonists, such as morphine, into the nucleus accumbens shell produces increases in eating behavior (i.e. 'wanting' for food). This study (1) reports direct evidence that activation of accumbens opioid receptors in rats also augments food 'liking', or the hedonic impact of taste, and (2) identified a neural site that definitely contains receptors capable of increasing food intake. Morphine microinjections (0.5 microgram) into accumbens shell, which caused rats  to increase eating, were found also to cause selective increases in positive hedonic patterns of behavioral affective reaction elicited by oral sucrose, using the 'taste reactivity' test of hedonic palatability. This positive shift indicated that morphine microinjections enhanced the hedonic impact of food palatability. The accumbens site mediating morphine-induced increases in food 'wanting' and 'liking' was identified using a novel method based on local expression of Fos induced directly by drug microinjections. The plume-shaped region of drug-induced increase in Fos immunoreactivity immediately surrounding a morphine microinjection site (Fos plume) was objectively mapped. A point-sampling procedure was used to measure the shape and size of 'positive' plumes of Fos expression triggered by microinjections of morphine at locations that caused increases in eating behavior. This revealed a functionally 'positive' neural region, containing receptors directly activated by behaviorally-effective drug microinjections. A subtraction mapping procedure was then used to eliminate all surrounding regions containing any 'negative' Fos plumes that failed to increase  food intake. The subtraction produced a conservative map of the positive site, by eliminating regions that gave mixed effects, and leaving only a positive region that must contain receptors capable of mediating increases in food intake. The resulting mapped 'opioid eating site' was contained primarily within the medial caudal subregion of the nucleus accumbens shell, and did not substantially penetrate either into the accumbens core or into other subregions of the shell. Several other structures outside the nucleus accumbens (such as rostral ventral pallidum), immediately medial and adjacent to the shell, also appeared to be included in the functional site. Opioid receptors within this site thus are capable of mediating morphine-induced increases in eating, in part by enhancing the hedonic reward properties of food.", "10704511": "Clinical manifestations in diseases affecting the dopamine system include deficits in emotional, cognitive, and motor function. Although the parallel organization of specific corticostriatal pathways is well documented, mechanisms  by which dopamine might integrate information across different cortical/basal ganglia circuits are less well understood. We analyzed a collection of retrograde and anterograde tracing studies to understand how the striatonigrostriatal (SNS)  subcircuit directs information flow between ventromedial (limbic), central (associative), and dorsolateral (motor) striatal regions. When viewed as a whole, the ventromedial striatum projects to a wide range of the dopamine cells and receives a relatively small dopamine input. In contrast, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) receives input from a broad expanse of dopamine cells and has a confined input to the substantia nigra (SN). The central striatum (CS) receives input from and projects to a relatively wide range of the SN. The SNS projection  from each striatal region contains three substantia nigra components: a dorsal group of nigrostriatal projecting cells, a central region containing both nigrostriatal projecting cells and its reciprocal striatonigral terminal fields,  and a ventral region that receives a specific striatonigral projection but does not contain its reciprocal nigrostriatal projection. Examination of results from  multiple tracing experiments simultaneously demonstrates an interface between different striatal regions via the midbrain dopamine cells that forms an ascending spiral between regions. The shell influences the core, the core influences the central striatum, and the central striatum influences the dorsolateral striatum. This anatomical arrangement creates a hierarchy of information flow and provides an anatomical basis for the limbic/cognitive/motor  interface via the ventral midbrain.", "9856954": "Cocaine regulates the transcription factor CREB (adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate response element binding protein) in rat nucleus accumbens, a brain region that is important for addiction. Overexpression of CREB in this region decreases the rewarding effects of cocaine and makes low doses of the drug aversive. Conversely, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant CREB increases the rewarding effects of cocaine. Altered transcription of dynorphin likely contributes to these effects: Its expression is increased by overexpression of CREB and decreased by overexpression of mutant CREB. Moreover, blockade of kappa  opioid receptors (on which dynorphin acts) antagonizes the negative effect of CREB on cocaine reward. These results identify an intracellular cascade-culminating in gene expression-through which exposure to cocaine modifies subsequent responsiveness to the drug.", "9739125": "The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) can be subdivided into 'core' and 'shell' based on anatomical connections and histochemical markers. Previous studies have demonstrated dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactive (DBH-ir) fibers in the NAcc shell, but the source of these noradrenergic (NE) afferents has not been determined. Therefore, we have investigated in detail the anatomy of NE afferents to this subregion. Dual immunohistochemistry for DBH and substance P demonstrated numerous DBH-ir fibers in the caudal NAcc shell. Neurons projecting to the NAcc were identified with Fluoro-Gold (FG) or cholera toxin B (CTb) retrograde tracing and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry. Single- and double-labeled neurons were observed in the A2 and A1 NE cell groups following FG injections into the caudal NAcc shell. Numerous FG and CTb single-labeled neurons were found in the rostral locus coeruleus (LC), subcoeruleus and pericoerulear dendritic region, with an occasional double-labeled neuron in the LC. Few labeled neurons were seen in the brainstem after FG injections into the NAcc core, consistent with the lack of DBH-ir in this subterritory. To confirm these results, injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin or biotinylated dextran amine were made into the LC or nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Virtually no labeled fibers were observed in the NAcc following injections into central LC. However, fibers were observed in the NAcc shell after injections in the NTS. These results indicate that the primary source(s) of NE afferents to the NAcc shell is the A2 region of the NTS, with lesser contributions from A1 and LC.", "9298512": "Previous studies have indicated that central opioid peptides and opiate receptors play an important role in the modulation of ingestive behaviors. The nucleus accumbens (Acb), a forebrain region involved in reinforcement, contains high levels of opiate receptors. The present investigation was undertaken to determine the relative involvement of opiate receptor subtypes in sucrose drinking. Morphine (0, 0.5, 5 micrograms/0.5 microliter), the mu agonist D-Ala2, NMe-Phe4,  Glyo 15-enkephalin (DAMGO; 0, 0.025, 0.25 and 2.5 micrograms/0.5 microliter), the delta agonist D-Pen2,5-enkephalin (DPEN; 0, 0.031, 0.31, 3.1 micrograms/0.5 microliter), and the kappa agonists U50488H (0, 0.0186, 0.186, 1.86 micrograms/0.5 microliter), and dynorphin (0, 0.05, 0.5, 5 micrograms/0.5 microliter) were microinfused into Acb. Intake of 5% sucrose, drinking duration,  locomotion, rearing, and grooming were measured in a 30-min session in rats previously adapted to sucrose. After microinjection into Acb, morphine induced a  robust increase in both sucrose intake and drinking duration at the low dose. DAMGO enhanced sucrose drinking at lower doses, and suppressed drinking at the highest dose. DPEN also increased sucrose intake in a dose-dependent manner. U50488H and dynorphin had no effect on sucrose drinking. In addition, it was demonstrated that intra-Acb administration of DAMGO specifically enhanced palatable sweet solution drinking, leaving water intake unchanged. Although mu and delta agonists tended to increase spontaneous motor activity, the pattern of  effects indicated that increases in ingestion could not be simply attributed to general arousal. These findings demonstrate that both mu and delta receptors within the accumbens may have an important modulatory role in ingestion of palatable substances.", "8783254": "Regions of the prefrontal cortex that project to the nucleus accumbens in the rat receive input from midline thalamic and basal amygdaloid nuclei which also project to the same striatal region as their prefrontal cortical target. For example, the prelimbic cortex projects to the medial nucleus accumbens, and receives input from the paraventricular thalamic nucleus and the parvicellular basal amygdala. These latter two areas also project to the medial nucleus accumbens. It has been shown that afferents from the prelimbic cortex, the paraventricular thalamic nucleus and the parvicellular basal amygdala to the nucleus accumbens overlap or are separated in the nucleus accumbens, depending upon their position in the shell and core. The dorsal agranular insular cortex, the intermediodorsal thalamic nucleus and the magnocellular basal amygdaloid nucleus terminate in the lateral part of the nucleus accumbens and adjacent ventral part of the caudate-putamen. The intermediodorsal thalamic nucleus and the magnocellular basal amygdaloid nucleus reach both the dorsal agranular insular cortex and the lateral nucleus accumbens, and thus appear positioned to influence the prefrontal corticostriatal system at cortical and striatal levels.  However, all three afferent systems have a heterogeneous distribution within this striatal region, and whether these projections actually reach the same areas is unknown. We investigated the patterns of separation and overlap in the nucleus accumbens between dorsal agranular insular cortical, magnocellular basal amygdaloid and intermediodorsal thalamic afferents with respect to the histochemical features of the nucleus. Techniques allowing the detection of two different anterograde tracers, or a single anterograde tracer and Calbindin-D28k  immunoreactivity, in the same tissue sections were used. The results demonstrate  that the afferents from the dorsal agranular insular area and the intermediodorsal thalamic nucleus avoid the shell of the lateral nucleus accumbens, which receives strong inputs from the magnocellular basal amygdala. In the matrix of the core and the ventral part of the caudate-putamen, fibers from the superficial layers of the dorsal agranular insular area overlap precisely with afferents from the intermediodorsal nucleus. In the patches, projections from the deep layers of the dorsal agranular insular cortex coincide with those from the magnocellular basal amygdala. The present findings have implications for the compartmental structure of the nucleus accumbens and provide novel insights into the organizational principles of prefrontal corticostriatal circuits.", "8783237": "The D3 dopamine receptor, belonging to the D2-like receptor subfamily, displays both specific pharmacology and a unique pattern of expression, especially compared to the D1 and D2 receptors. A rat D3 complementary RNA probe labelled with [35S]UTP was used to map the neurons expressing the D3 receptor gene in the  rat brain. In particular, we identified the phenotype of the neurons containing D3 messenger. RNA in the nucleus accumbens, with respect to the striatal segregated populations of enkephalin and substance P neurons, by using strategies of double in situ hybridization. In addition, comparison with D1 and D2 receptor  gene expression was performed to study the potential co-localization of several dopamine receptors within the same neurons in the ventral striatum. The highest level of D3 messenger RNA was detected in the islands of Calleja and the nucleus  accumbens. Other areas such as the caudate-putamen, some hypothalamic, thalamic and cortical areas and lobule 10 of the cerebellum also contained low but significant levels of D3 messenger RNA. Our results demonstrate that the D3 receptor is co-expressed either with D1 or with D2 receptor, both in the core and shell regions, in a subpopulation of substance P and enkephalin neurons, respectively. They also suggest that a significant part of the accumbal neurons only express either D1 or D2, without co-expression with the D3 receptor. These data imply that dopamine in the nucleus accumbens may act on each population of efferent neurons via the co-expression of two distinct dopamine receptors (D1+D3  or D2+D3), and that synergistic D1-like/D2-like effects may occur at the level of a single neuron, through the co-expression of D1 and D3 receptors in a significant proportion of substance P neurons (16% or 26% in the core and shell regions, respectively.", "8774456": "The basal amygdaloid complex (BAC) topographically projects to the nucleus accumbens (Acb) in patchy, inhomogeneous patterns. These termination patterns may be related to the histological features of the Acb that define the shell, core, and adjacent ventral caudate-putamen (CPv), and the ventral striatal compartments providing output to different autonomic, motor, and endocrine targets. Knowledge  of the relationships of BAC afferents with these compartments is essential for understanding the activities of amygdalostriatal circuits. Therefore, anterograde tracing experiments were performed, combined with calbindin-D28K (CaB) immunohistochemistry or Nissl staining. The results demonstrated that the caudal  parvicellular basal amygdala (Bpc) projected primarily to cell clusters in the dorsal shell of the medial Acb, and to patches in the core/CPv. Fibers from the caudal accessory basal nucleus (AB) selectively reached CaB-immunoreactive cell clusters in the ventral shell, avoiding the core/CPv. The rostral AB projected to the same ventral shell compartments as the caudal AB; in addition, dense terminations were found in the matrix of the core/CPv, avoiding the patches. Caudal magnocellular basal amygdala (Bmg) fibers reached ventral parts of the shell, including the CaB-immunoreactive cell clusters. The caudal Bmg projected strongly to the patches of the core/CPv, evading the matrix. Finally, the rostral Bmg densely innervated the moderately CaB-immunoreactive lateral shell and the patches of the core/CPv, largely avoiding the matrix. These results indicate the  specific compartmental relationships of the patchy BAC terminations and suggest that BAC subregions differentially influence particular ventral striatal outputs.", "8624711": "Ventricular microinjection studies found that whereas mu (beta-funaltrexamine, B-FNA), mu1 (naloxonazine) and kappa (nor-binaltorphamine, Nor-BNI) opioid receptor antagonists, but not delta antagonists, reduce deprivation-induced intake, kappa and mu, but not mu1 or delta antagonists reduce both 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) hyperphagia and sucrose intake. Since opioid agonists stimulate spontaneous food intake in the accumbens, the present study examined whether administration of either naltrexone, B-FNA or Nor-BNI in the accumbens altered intake under deprivation (24 h), glucoprivic (2DG: 500 mg/kg, i.p.) or palatable sucrose (10%) conditions. Naloxonazine's effects in the accumbens were  also evaluated for deprivation-induced intake. Deprivation-induced intake was significantly decreased over 4 h by naltrexone (5-20 micrograms, 44%), B-FNA (1-4 micrograms, 55%) and Nor-BNI (4 micrograms, 31%) but not naloxonazine (10 micrograms) in the accumbens. 2DG hyperphagia was significantly decreased by naltrexone (10-20 microgram, 79%), B-FNA (1-4 micrograms, 100%) and NOR-BNI (104  micrograms, 75%) in the accumbens. Sucrose intake was significantly decreased by  naltrexone (50 micrograms, 27%) and B-FNA (1-4 micrograms, 37%), but not NOR-BNI  in the accumbens. These data suggest that mu receptors, and particularly the mu2  binding site in the accumbens are responsible for the opioid modulation of these  forms of intake in this nucleus, and that this control may be acting upon the amount of intake per se.", "8389860": "Previous work has shown that morphine infusion into the ventral striatum results  in marked hyperphagia in satiated rats. The present investigation was undertaken  to determine the relative involvement of opiate receptor subtypes in this phenomenon. Equimolar doses of the synthetic ligands [D-Ala2,NME-Phe4,Gly-ol5]-enkephalin (DAMGO; 0, 0.025, 0.25, and 2.5 micrograms/0.5 microliter), [D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin (DPEN; 0, 0.031, 0.31, 3.1 and  6.2 micrograms/0.5 microliter) and U50,488H (0, 0.0186, 0.186, 1.86 and 3.72 micrograms/0.5 microliters), which are selective for mu, delta and kappa receptors, respectively, were microinfused into three striatal sites: the nucleus accumbens, ventromedial striatum and ventrolateral striatum. Food intake (grams), feeding, drinking, locomotion, rearing and grooming were measured. After injection into all three sites, DAMGO induced a robust, dose-dependent increase in food intake that was blocked by coadministration of naltrexone (5 mg/kg i.p.). DAMGO-induced feeding was delayed in onset and was long lasting. Injections of DPEN were 2 to 3 times less effective in eliciting feeding. DPEN-induced feeding  occurred immediately and was short lasting. U50,488H had no effect on food intake. No changes in drinking were noted for any agonist. Spontaneous motor behaviors were also increased by DAMGO and DPEN. These findings demonstrate that  mu opiate receptors within the ventral striatum mediate the opiate-induced feeding response.", "8207500": "The basal ganglia have been implicated in motor planning and motor learning. In the study reported here, we directly tested for response plasticity in striatal neurons of macaque monkeys undergoing Pavlovian conditioning. To focus the study, we recorded from the tonically active neurons (TANs) of the striatum, which are known to respond to conditioned sensory stimuli that signal reward delivery and elicit behavioral reactions. The activities of 858 TANs were recorded extracellularly from the striatum in alert behaving macaque monkeys before, during, and after the acquisition of a classical conditioning task. Two monkeys were trained to lick reward juice delivered on a spoon simultaneously with the presentation of a click. Almost no licks were triggered by the cues at the start  of training, but by the fifth day more than 90% of licks were triggered, and values were near 100% for the remainder of the 3 week training period. In the striatum, only a small number of TANs responded to the clicks at the start before conditioning (about 17%). During training, the numbers of responding TANs gradually increased, so that by the end of training more than 50-70% of the TANs  recorded (51.3-73.5%) became responsive to the clicks. The responses consisted of a pause in firing that occurred approximately 90 msec after the click and that was in some cells preceded by a brief activation and in most cells was followed by a rebound excitation. Prolonged recordings from single TANs (n = 6) showed that individual TANs can acquire a conditioned response within at least as short  a time as 10 min. TANs retained such responsiveness after overtraining, and also  after a 4 week intermission in training. When the monkey was trained to receive rewards in relation to a new conditioning stimulus, TANs were capable of switching their sensory response to the new stimulus. Histological reconstruction showed that the TANs that became responsive were broadly distributed in the region of striatum explored, which included the dorsal half to two-thirds of the  caudate nucleus and putamen over a large anteroposterior span. We conclude that,  during the acquisition of a sensorimotor association, TANs widely distributed through the striatum become responsive to sensory stimuli that induce conditioned behavior. This distributed change in activity could serve to modulate the activity of surrounding projection neurons in the striatum engaged in mediating learned behavior.", "7693897": "Interneurons in lateral part of neostriatum were studied in isolated slices from  juvenile rats (16-20 d postnatal) by whole-cell, current-clamp recording at 33-34 degrees C, followed by intracellular staining with biocytin and double immunocytochemical or histochemical staining for parvalbumin, ChAT, and NADPH diaphorase. Medium-sized spiny neurons (MS cells) had distal dendrites with many  spines and were likely projection cells, while interneurons had dendrites with fewer spines. The neostriatal interneurons could be further divided into three classes by physiological, chemical, and morphological criteria. The first class of interneurons (fast-spiking cells, FS cells) fired very short-duration action potentials with short-duration afterhyperpolarizations at constant spike frequency during depolarizing current pulses. FS cells had more negative resting  potentials and lower input resistances than the other two classes. At depolarized potentials, FS cells fired repetitive spikes in response to synaptic excitation.  FS cells were immunoreactive for parvalbumin. As all parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells in the neostriatum were also immunoreactive for GABA, FS cells were considered to be GABAergic. FS cells were further divided into two morphological  types: FS cells with local dendritic fields and FS cells with extended dendritic  fields. The axons of both types of FS cells had their densest collateralization within or near their dendritic fields. The other two classes of interneuron, PLTS cells (persistent and low-threshold spike cells) and LA cells (long-lasting afterhyperpolarization cells), were distinguished from FS cells by longer-duration action potentials and larger input resistances, had less negative resting potentials, and had longer-lasting afterhyperpolarizations. Afterhyperpolarizations of PLTS cells had a shorter time to peak than those of LA cells. PLTS cells fired both Na(+)-dependent, persistent depolarization spikes and Ca(2+)-dependent, low-threshold spikes in addition to fast spikes. Low-threshold spikes in PLTS cells were induced only from hyperpolarized potentials. Both persistent depolarizations and low-threshold spikes could also be evoked by synaptic activation. PLTS cells were histochemically identified as NADPH diaphorase-positive cells. As all NADPH diaphorase-positive cells in the same tissue were immunoreactive for nitric oxide (NO) synthase, PLTS cells were considered to release NO. PLTS cells had the largest axonal fields. Some PLTS cells appeared to have two axonal origins from the somata and dendrites. LA cells were mostly large aspiny cells with Ca(2+)-dependent long-lasting afterhyperpolarizations and strong time-dependent hyperpolarizing rectification.  As this slowly occurring anomalous rectification was blocked by 2 mM cesium, this potential was considered to be due to activation of Ih.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "3887206": "Immunocytochemistry, radioimmunological assay after surgical cuts, anterograde degeneration and retrograde tracing of fluorescent dyes were used in order to elucidate the cholecystokinin-containing afferents to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and ventral part of the caudate-putamen).  In agreement with the report by H\u00f6kfelt et al., midbrain cholecystokinin-containing cells supply the posteromedial parts of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle, as well as the subcommissural part of caudate-putamen. Brainstem cholecystokinin afferents also reach more rostral parts of the ventral striatum including the rostrolateral olfactory tubercle. The ascending cholecystokinin axons enter the medial forebrain bundle at the meso-diencephalic border and maintain a rough medial to lateral topography at the caudal diencephalon. A second major cholecystokinin pathway, with possible origin in the piriform and medial prefrontal cortices and/or the amygdala, projects to the subcommissural caudate-putamen, the olfactory tubercle, the lateral part of the nucleus accumbens and the dorsal part of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis. Finally, the rostral part of the dorsal caudate-putamen receives a substantial cholecystokinin innervation from the basolateral amygdala and possibly from the neocortex. According to radioimmunological data, the descending telencephalic cholecystokinin system accounts for about 60% of all cholecystokinin in the rostral forebrain. The combined use of morphological and biochemical methods provided evidence for a partially overlapping distribution and possible interaction between an ascending brainstem and descending telencephalic cholecystokinin fiber systems within the striatum and related rostral forebrain areas.", "2464402": "In situ hybridization histochemistry using cDNA oligonucleotide probes for the neuropeptides dynorphin, enkephalin and substance P was used to map the distribution of peptidergic neurons in the striatal patch and matrix compartments in the rat.

Fluorescent retrograde axonal tracing combined with in situ hybridization histochemistry demonstrated that the majority of neurons expressing enkephalin project to the globus pallidus and few project to the substantia nigra, whereas the reverse obtains for neurons expressing dynorphin and substance P.", "2085740": "Parvalbumin (PV)-immunoreactive neurons in rat neostriatum were studied under light and electron microscopes. A small number of neurons in the striatum were immunoreactive for PV (a Ca-binding protein). Most of them were also strongly immunoreactive for glutamate decarboxylase but were negative for NADPH-diaphorase activity. Light microscopic analysis revealed that PV-containing neurons have somata with fusiform or polygonal shape and are medium to large in size. The dendrites were smooth and cylindrical at the proximal portion but were varicose at the distal portion. Thin PV-immunoreactive fibers with large boutons were unevenly distributed in the striatum. Electron microscopy revealed that the somata of PV-immunoreactive neurons had a deeply indented nucleus with a nucleolus and often an intranuclear rod. These are the morphological features reported for interneurons of the striatum. Gap junctions formed between two neighboring PV-immunoreactive dendrites. A total of 175 boutons forming synapses  with somata and dendrites of PV-immunoreactive neurons were examined. Of these, 115 were small in diameter (less than 1 micron), contained densely packed round vesicles and formed asymmetrical synapses mainly with dendrites. The other 60 boutons formed symmetrical synapses with somata and dendrites of PV-immunoreactive neurons. Both myelinated and unmyelinated axons with boutons were observed. PV-immunoreactive boutons had a diameter of 0.3-2 microns and contained round or elongated vesicles which were about 35 nm in diameter. The boutons formed symmetrical synapses with postsynaptic targets. Of the 100 PV-immunoreactive boutons, 51 were found on somata and proximal dendrites of medium-sized neurons containing a large, round, centrally located nucleus. The others formed synapses with dendrites of various sizes. It was occasionally observed that varicose dendrites free of spines were contacted by a large number  of PV-immunoreactive boutons. The study indicates that, in the striatum, immunocytochemistry for PV selectively stains GABAergic interneurons and that the GABAergic interneurons are incorporated in a feed-forward inhibitory circuit of the striatum.", "1349255": "The synaptic targets and size distributions of the sectioned profiles of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive fibers and boutons in the neostriatum and shell and core of the nucleus accumbens were evaluated. Significantly more synaptic contacts where dendrite shafts are the postsynaptic element were observed in the  shell than in the core of the nucleus accumbens or neostriatum. Relative to the core and neostriatum, a significantly greater proportion of the tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive innervation of the accumbal shell consisted of thin fiber and small bouton profiles. Thus, with regard to the morphometric parameters evaluated, the core of the nucleus accumbens is aligned with neostriatum and the  shell is different from the core and neostriatum. In the light of these data, it  is probably that the effects of the dopaminergic innervation in the core resemble the effects in neostriatum more than do those in the shell.", "683502": "Efferent connections and nigral afferents of the nucleus accumbens septi in the rat.", "26946430": "A major mouse model widely adopted in recent years to induce pronounced ethanol intake is the ethanol vapor model known as \"CIE\" or \"Chronic Intermittent Ethanol.\" One critical question concerning this model is whether the rapid induction of high blood ethanol levels for such short time periods is sufficient  to induce alterations in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function which may contribute to excessive ethanol intake. In this study, we determined whether such short term intermittent ethanol exposure modulates NMDAR function as well as other prominent electrophysiological properties and the expression of plasticity  in both D1 (D1+) and D2 (D1-) dopamine receptor expressing medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. To distinguish between the two subtypes of MSNs in the NAc we treated Drd1a-TdTomato transgenic mice with CIE vapor and electrophysiological recordings were conducted 24\u00a0h after the last vapor exposure. To investigate CIE induced alterations in plasticity, long-term depression (LTD) was induced by pairing low frequency stimulation (LFS) with post synaptic depolarization. In ethanol na\u00efve mice, LFS induced synaptic depression (LTD) was apparent exclusively in D1+ MSNs. Whereas in slices prepared from CIE treated mice, LFS induced synaptic potentiation (LTP) in D1+ MSNs. Furthermore, following CIE exposure, LFS now produced LTD in D1- MSNs. We found that CIE exposure induced an increase in excitability in D1+ MSNs with no change in D1- MSNs. After CIE, we found a significant increase in spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) frequency in D1+ but not D1- MSNs suggesting alterations in baseline \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) mediated signaling. CIE induced changes in NMDAR function were measured using the NMDA/AMPA ratio and input-output curves of isolated NMDAR currents. We observed a significant increase in NMDAR function in D1+ MSNs and a decrease in D1- MSNs after ethanol vapor exposure. The reversal of NMDAR function may account for the  CIE induced alterations in the expression of plasticity. The cell type specific alterations in excitatory signaling in the NAc shell may constitute an important  neuroadaptation necessary for the expression of increased ethanol consumption induced by intermittent ethanol vapor exposure.

MSNs expressing dopamine D1 (D1R-MSN) vs. D2 receptors (D2R-MSN) can exert antagonistic effects in drug-related behaviors, and display distinct alterations  in glutamate signaling following repeated exposure to psychostimulants; however,  little is known of cell-type-specific plasticity induced by opiates. Here, we find that repeated morphine potentiates excitatory transmission and increases GluA2-lacking AMPA receptor expression in D1R-MSNs, while reducing signaling in D2-MSNs following 10-14 d of forced abstinence. In vivo reversal of this pathophysiology with optogenetic stimulation of infralimbic cortex-accumbens shell (ILC-NAc shell) inputs or treatment with the antibiotic, ceftriaxone, blocked reinstatement of morphine-evoked conditioned place preference. These findings confirm the presence of overlapping and distinct plasticity produced by  classes of abused drugs within subpopulations of MSNs that may provide targetable molecular mechanisms for future pharmacotherapies.", "26585289": "Addiction is a behavioral disease, of which core components can be modeled in rodents. Much evidence implicates drug-evoked synaptic plasticity in cocaine-evoked locomotor sensitization, cue-induced cocaine seeking, and incubation of cocaine craving. However, the type of plasticity evoked by different modalities of cocaine administration (eg contingent vs non-contingent)  and its role in reshaping circuit function remains largely elusive. Here we exposed mice to various regimens of cocaine and recorded excitatory transmission  onto identified medium-sized spiny neurons (MSN, expressing fluorescent proteins  under the control of either D1R or D2R dopamine receptor promotor) in the nucleus accumbens at time points when behavioral adaptations are observed. In D1-MSN, we  found the presence of GluA2-lacking \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) after single or chronic non-contingent exposure to cocaine as well as after cocaine self-administration (SA). We also report an increase in the AMPA/NMDA ratio (A/N) in D1-MSN, which was observed only after repeated passive injections associated with locomotor sensitization as well as in a condition of SA leading to seeking behavior. Remarkably, insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPARs was also detected in D2-MSN after SA of a high dose of cocaine but not regular dose (1.5 vs 0.75\u2009mg/kg), which was the only condition where incubation of cocaine craving was observed in this study. Moreover, synapses containing GluA2-lacking AMPARs belonged to amygdala inputs in D2-MSN and to medial prefrontal cortex inputs in D1-MSN. Taken together this study allows for a refinement of a circuit model of addiction based on specific synaptic changes induced by cocaine.", "25349168": "Activation of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the nucleus accumbens is necessary for the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, an animal model of drug craving and relapse. AMPARs are tetrameric protein complexes that consist of GluA1-4 subunits, of which GluA2 imparts calcium permeability. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 2 (ADAR2) is a nuclear enzyme that is essential for editing GluA2 pre-mRNA at Q/R site 607. Unedited GluA2(Q) subunits form calcium-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs), whereas edited GluA2(R) subunits form calcium-impermeable channels (CI-AMPARs). Emerging evidence suggests that the reinstatement of cocaine seeking is associated with increased synaptic expression of CP-AMPARs in the nucleus accumbens. However, the role of GluA2 Q/R site editing and ADAR2 in cocaine seeking is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of forced cocaine abstinence on GluA2 Q/R site editing and ADAR2 expression in the nucleus  accumbens. Our results demonstrate that 7 days of cocaine abstinence is associated with decreased GluA2 Q/R site editing and reduced ADAR2 expression in  the accumbens shell, but not core, of cocaine-experienced rats compared with yoked saline controls. To examine the functional significance of ADAR2 and GluA2  Q/R site editing in cocaine seeking, we used viral-mediated gene delivery to overexpress ADAR2b in the accumbens shell. Increased ADAR2b expression in the shell attenuated cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking and was associated with increased GluA2 Q/R site editing and surface expression of GluA2-containing AMPARs. Taken together, these findings support the novel hypothesis that an increased contribution of accumbens shell CP-AMPARs containing unedited GluA2(Q) promotes cocaine seeking. Therefore, CP-AMPARs containing unedited GluA2(Q) represent a novel target for cocaine addiction pharmacotherapies.", "25122682": "Alcoholism involves long-term cognitive deficits, including memory impairment, resulting in substantial cost to society. Neuronal refinement and stabilization are hypothesized to confer resilience to poor decision making and addictive-like  behaviors, such as excessive ethanol drinking and dependence. Accordingly, structural abnormalities are likely to contribute to synaptic dysfunctions that occur from suddenly ceasing the use of alcohol after chronic ingestion. Here we show that ethanol-dependent rats display a loss of dendritic spines in medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens (Nacc) shell, accompanied by a reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining and postsynaptic density 95-positive elements. Further analysis indicates that \"long thin\" but not \"mushroom\" spines are selectively affected. In addition, patch-clamp experiments from Nacc slices reveal that long-term depression (LTD) formation is hampered, with parallel changes in field potential recordings and reductions in NMDA-mediated synaptic currents. These changes are restricted to the withdrawal phase of ethanol dependence, suggesting their relevance in the genesis of signs and/or symptoms affecting ethanol withdrawal and thus the whole addictive cycle. Overall, these results highlight the key role of dynamic alterations in dendritic spines and their presynaptic afferents in the evolution of alcohol dependence. Furthermore,  they suggest that the selective loss of long thin spines together with a reduced  NMDA receptor function may affect learning. Disruption of this LTD could contribute to the rigid emotional and motivational state observed in alcohol dependence.", "24553949": "Extended-access cocaine self-administration results in withdrawal-dependent incubation of cocaine craving. Rats evaluated after \u223c1 month of withdrawal from such regimens (\"incubated rats\") exhibit changes in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) that include accumulation of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) and a switch in group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated suppression of synaptic transmission from mGluR5-dependent to mGluR1-dependent. To determine the role of protein synthesis in mediating these adaptations, we conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in NAc core MSNs of \"incubated rats\" in the presence of translational inhibitors (anisomycin, cycloheximide, rapamycin) or the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin-D. The contribution of CP-AMPARs to synaptic transmission was determined by the rectification index and the sensitivity to the CP-AMPAR antagonist 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine. We found that CP-AMPAR-mediated transmission in the NAc of \"incubated rats\" was reduced to levels comparable to those found in saline control rats when brain slices were treated with translational inhibitors, whereas actinomycin-D had no effect. We also investigated the effect of protein translation inhibitors on the switch of mGluR function in MSNs of \"incubated rats\" using the group I mGluR agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine in combination with either an mGluR1 (LY367385) or an mGluR5 (3-[(2-methyl-4-thiazolyl)ethynyl]pyridine) antagonist. Data revealed that inhibition of protein translation eliminated the mGluR1-mediated inhibition and restored the mGluR5 responsiveness to a state functionally similar to that of saline control rats. Together, these results suggest that aberrant regulation of  local protein synthesis contributes to the maintenance of adaptations accrued at  NAc MSN synapses during incubation of cocaine craving.", "23727437": "Cue-induced cocaine craving in rodents intensifies or \"incubates\" during the first months of withdrawal from long access cocaine self-administration. This incubation phenomenon is relevant to human users who achieve abstinence but exhibit persistent vulnerability to cue-induced relapse. It is well established that incubation of cocaine craving involves complex neuronal circuits. Here we will focus on neuroadaptations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region of convergence for pathways that control cocaine seeking. A key adaptation is a delayed (~3-4 weeks) accumulation of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPAR receptors (CP-AMPARs) in synapses on medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the NAc. These CP-AMPARs mediate the expression of incubation after prolonged withdrawal, although different mechanisms must be responsible during the first weeks of withdrawal, prior to CP-AMPAR accumulation. The cascade of events leading to CP-AMPAR accumulation is  still unclear. However, several candidate mechanisms have been identified. First, mGluR1 has been shown to negatively regulate CP-AMPAR levels in NAc synapses, and it is possible that a withdrawal-dependent decrease in this effect may help explain CP-AMPAR accumulation during incubation. Second, an increase in phosphorylation of GluA1 subunits (at the protein kinase A site) within extrasynaptic homomeric GluA1 receptors (CP-AMPARs) may promote their synaptic insertion and oppose their removal. Finally, elevation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the NAc may contribute to maintenance of incubation after months of withdrawal, although incubation-related increases in BDNF accumulation do not account for CP-AMPAR accumulation. Receptors and pathways that negatively regulate incubation, such as mGluR1, are promising targets for the development of therapeutic strategies to help recovering addicts  maintain abstinence.

Moreover, functional studies suggest that NAC Group 1 mGluR/Homer2/PI3K signaling may be a potential target for pharmacotherapeutic intervention in alcoholism. METHODS: Immunoblotting was conducted to examine the effects of alcohol consumption under drinking-in-the-dark (DID) procedures on Group 1 mGluR-associated proteins in C57BL/6J (B6) mice. Follow-up behavioral studies examined the importance of Group 1 mGluR/Homer2/PI3K signaling within the NAC shell for limited-access alcohol drinking. Finally, immunoblotting examined whether the NAC expression of Group 1 mGluR-associated proteins is a genetic correlate of high alcohol drinking using a selectively bred high DID (HDID-1) mouse line. RESULTS: Limited-access alcohol drinking under DID procedures up-regulated NAC shell Homer2 levels, concomitant with increases in mGluR5 and NR2B. Intra-NAC shell blockade of mGluR5, Homer2, or PI3K signaling, as well as transgenic disruption of the Homer binding site on mGluR5, decreased alcohol consumption in  B6 mice. Moreover, transgenic disruption of the Homer binding site on mGluR5 and  Homer2 deletion both prevented the attenuating effect of mGluR5 and PI3K blockade upon intake. Finally, the basal NAC shell protein expression of mGluR1 and Homer2 was increased in offspring of HDID-1 animals. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data further implicate Group 1 mGluR signaling through Homer2 within the NAC in excessive alcohol consumption.", "21041654": "Alcohol addiction is a chronically relapsing disorder that includes certain maladaptive learning and memory. The serine and threonine kinase complex, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), has been implicated in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory by controlling protein translation. Here we show that administration of alcohol and excessive voluntary consumption of alcohol induce the activation of the mTORC1-mediated signaling pathway in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rodents. We further show that the protein expression levels of GluR1 and Homer, two synaptic proteins whose translation has been shown to be modulated by mTORC1, are up-regulated in the NAc of rodents with a history of excessive alcohol consumption. In addition, our results document that the Food and Drug Administration-approved inhibitor of mTORC1, rapamycin, decreases expression of alcohol-induced locomotor sensitization and place preference, as well as excessive alcohol intake and seeking in preclinical rodent models of alcohol abuse. Together, our results suggest that mTORC1 within the NAc is a contributor to molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol-drinking behaviors. Furthermore, despite its massive health and socioeconomic impact worldwide, pharmacotherapies for alcohol abuse and addiction remain limited. Our data therefore put forward the possibility that targeting the mTORC1 signaling cascade is an innovative and valuable strategy for the treatment of alcohol use and abuse disorders.", "20947635": "Glutamatergic synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is implicated in response to sensitization to psychomotor-stimulating agents, yet ethanol effects  here are undefined. We studied the acute in vitro and in vivo effects of ethanol  in medium spiny neurons from the shell NAc subregion of slices of C57BL/6 mice by using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSCs). Synaptic conditioning (low-frequency stimulation with concurrent postsynaptic depolarization) reliably depressed AMPA EPSCs by nearly 30%; this accumbal long-term depression (LTD) was blocked by a nonselective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid) and a selective NMDA receptor 2B antagonist  [R-(R*,S*)-\u03b1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-\u03b2-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidine propanol].  Acute ethanol exposure inhibited the depression of AMPA EPSCs differentially with increasing concentrations, but this inhibitory action of ethanol was occluded by  a D1-selective dopamine receptor agonist. Ethanol dependence was elicited in C57BL/6 mice by two separate 4-day bouts of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure. When assessed 24 h after a single bout of in vivo CIE vapor exposure, NAc LTD was absent, and instead NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic potentiation [long-term potentiation (LTP)] was reliably observed. It is noteworthy that both LTP and LTD were completely absent after an extended withdrawal (72 h) after a single 3-day CIE vapor bout. These observations demonstrate that 1) accumbal synaptic depression is mediated by NR2B receptors, 2) accumbal synaptic depression is highly sensitive to both acute and chronic ethanol exposure, and 3) alterations in this synaptic process may constitute a neural adaptation that contributes to the induction and/or expression of ethanol  dependence.", "20946890": "The subunit composition of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptors (AMPARs) is an important determinant of AMPAR biophysical properties and trafficking. To date, AMPAR subunit composition has been quantitatively evaluated only for the hippocampus, where different experimental approaches have  yielded different results. Here, we used quantitative co-immunoprecipitation to characterize GluA1-3 associations in the adult rat nucleus accumbens, dorsal striatum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus, and blue native electrophoresis (BNE) to study GluA1-3 assembly state. In all brain regions, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that ~90% of GluA1 was associated with  GluA2 or GluA3 (most was GluA1A2). All regions contained a small number of GluA1A3 receptors. Homomeric GluA1 receptors may also exist. More than half of the GluA2 (53%-65% depending on the region) was not associated with GluA1. However, this represents an over-estimate of the percent of GluA2 present in GluA2A3 receptors, based on BNE results demonstrating that the majority of GluA2  exists as dimers, rather than functional tetrameric receptors. Relatively more GluA1 was present in tetramers. Together with other findings, our results suggest a dominant role for GluA1A2 receptors in all brain regions examined. They also help explain why different results for hippocampal AMPAR subunit composition were obtained using co-immunoprecipitation, which assesses the total cellular pool of  AMPARs including partially assembled AMPARs in intracellular compartments, and electrophysiological approaches, which can selectively assess tetrameric (functional) AMPARs on the cell surface.", "20576893": "Chronic exposure to drugs of abuse induces countless modifications in brain physiology. However, the neurobiological adaptations specifically associated with the transition to addiction are unknown.

Using a rat model of addiction, we found that animals that progressively develop the behavioral hallmarks of addiction have permanently impaired LTD, whereas LTD is progressively recovered in nonaddicted rats maintaining a controlled drug intake. By making drug seeking consistently resistant to modulation by environmental contingencies and consequently more and  more inflexible, a persistently impaired LTD could mediate the transition to addiction.", "16732275": "The core and shell of the nucleus accumbens have critical, differential roles in  drug-dependent behaviors.

The dynamic regulation of these receptors is important for normal synaptic function and in disease states.", "16311338": "Drug-dependent neural plasticity related to drug addiction and schizophrenia can  be modeled in animals as behavioral sensitization, which is induced by repeated noncontingent or self-administration of many drugs of abuse. Molecular mechanisms that are critical for behavioral sensitization have yet to be specified. Long-term depression (LTD) of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated synaptic transmission in the brain has been proposed as a cellular substrate for learning and memory. The expression of LTD in the nucleus  accumbens (NAc) required clathrin-dependent endocytosis of postsynaptic AMPARs. NAc LTD was blocked by a dynamin-derived peptide that inhibited clathrin-mediated endocytosis or by a GluR2-derived peptide that blocked regulated AMPAR endocytosis.

Specifically, we investigated the involvement of the dorsal hippocampus (DH), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) in contextual reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior and the involvement of the DH in explicit CS- and cocaine-induced reinstatement. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine in a  distinct context or in the presence of CSs paired explicitly with cocaine infusions. Responding of context-trained rats was then extinguished in the previously cocaine-paired or an alternate context, whereas responding of explicit CS-trained rats was extinguished in the absence of the CSs. Subsequently, the target brain regions or anatomical control regions were functionally inactivated  using tetrodotoxin (0 or 5 ng/side), and cocaine-seeking behavior (ie, nonreinforced responses) was assessed in the cocaine-paired context, in the alternate context, in the presence of the explicit CSs, or following cocaine priming (10 mg/kg, i.p.). DH inactivation abolished contextual, but failed to alter explicit CS- or cocaine-induced, reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior. BLA or dmPFC inactivation also abolished contextual reinstatement. Conversely, inactivation of the control brain regions failed to alter contextual reinstatement. In conclusion, the DH, BLA, and dmPFC play critical roles in contextual reinstatement. Previous findings suggest that the BLA is critical for  explicit CS-induced, but not cocaine-primed, reinstatement and the dmPFC is critical for both explicit CS-induced and cocaine-primed reinstatement. Thus, distinct but partially overlapping neural substrates mediate context-induced, explicit CS-induced, and cocaine-primed reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior.", "11932933": "Afferents to the nucleus accumbens from different sources innervate specific areas of the central \"core\" and peripheral \"shell\" and are related to each other, at the light microscopical level, in an intricate overlapping and nonoverlapping  way. This lack of homogeneity suggests that this region consists of circuits involving emsembles of neurons modulated by specific sets of convergent afferent  inputs and abnormal regulation of such ensembles has been implicated in mental disorders. Early extracellular studies suggested that individual Acb neurons might respond to activation of afferents from more than one excitatory input: More recent studies of hippocampal and amygdalar or prefrontal cortical afferents suggest that hippocampal afferents gate the input from the prefrontal cortex or amygdala. Electrophysiological evidence for convergence of excitatory afferents in the Acb is strong and suggests that these pathways are monosynaptic. Nevertheless, this convergence has proved difficult to demonstrate anatomically as a result of the spatial distribution of the afferent inputs on the dendritic tree of the target neurons. To establish whether individual accumbens neurons receive monosynaptic input from pairs of afferents, one projection was labelled anterogradely with Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin and the second with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) with Vector slate grey and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as the chromagens. Accumbens neurons possibly postsynaptic to  these afferents, labelled by an in vivo focal injection of BDA, were examined using correlated light and electron microscopy to establish the proximal-distal distribution of labelled afferent synaptic inputs on their dendritic arbours. Individual cells were shown to receive monosynaptic afferent input from both ventral subiculum and prefrontal cortex, providing an anatomical framework for the hippocampal gating of other limbic inputs to the accumbens.", "3683859": "The projections of the subiculum, as the main output structure of the hippocampal formation, to the striatum were studied in the rat using the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin. It appears that not only the entire nucleus accumbens, part of the so-called ventral striatum, receives fibres from the subiculum, but that the hippocampal projection area in the striatum includes also the most medial, ventral, rostral and caudal parts of the caudate-putamen complex. Moreover, a relatively small number of fibres and terminals are present  in the striatal elements of the medial part of the olfactory tubercle. The projections to the ventral and caudal parts of the caudate-putamen are predominantly derived from the ventral subiculum, whereas the projections to the  rostral part of the caudate-putamen are derived from the dorsal subiculum. Furthermore, with respect to the subiculum-accumbens pathway a topographical organization could be established. Thus, the ventral or temporal part of the subiculum projects predominantly to the caudomedial part of the nucleus accumbens, and to a lesser degree to its rostromedial portion, whereas progressively more dorsal or septal parts of the subiculum send fibres to successively more lateral and rostral portions of the nucleus accumbens. Very sparse projections are found to the contralateral nucleus accumbens, arranged in  a topographical manner similar to the ipsilateral projections. An important observation with respect to the structure of the nucleus accumbens is that the subicular terminations are inhomogeneously distributed, although a relation with  earlier described mosaic patterns in the connectivity and neurochemical composition of the nucleus is not yet clear. Subicular fibres have their densest  terminations in relatively cell-poor regions of the nucleus accumbens, and in particular tend to avoid small cell clusters.", "26171719": "Overconsumption of dietary fat is increasingly linked with motivational and emotional impairments. Human and animal studies demonstrate associations between  obesity and blunted reward function at the behavioral and neural level, but it is unclear to what degree such changes are a consequence of an obese state and whether they are contingent on dietary lipid class. We sought to determine the impact of prolonged ad libitum intake of diets rich in saturated or monounsaturated fat, separate from metabolic signals associated with increased adiposity, on dopamine (DA)-dependent behaviors and to identify pertinent signaling changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Male rats fed a saturated (palm oil), but not an isocaloric monounsaturated (olive oil), high-fat diet exhibited  decreased sensitivity to the rewarding (place preference) and locomotor-sensitizing effects of amphetamine as compared with low-fat diet controls. Blunted amphetamine action by saturated high-fat feeding was entirely independent of caloric intake, weight gain, and plasma levels of leptin, insulin, and glucose and was accompanied by biochemical and behavioral evidence of reduced D1R signaling in the NAc. Saturated high-fat feeding was also tied to protein markers of increased AMPA receptor-mediated plasticity and decreased DA transporter expression in the NAc but not to alterations in DA turnover and biosynthesis. Collectively, the results suggest that intake of saturated lipids can suppress DA signaling apart from increases in body weight and adiposity-related signals known to affect mesolimbic DA function, in part by diminishing D1 receptor signaling, and that equivalent intake of monounsaturated  dietary fat protects against such changes.", "26124708": "The study of the neural bases of eating behavior, hunger, and reward has consistently implicated the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and its interactions with mesocorticolimbic circuitry, such as mesolimbic dopamine projections to nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral pallidum (VP), in controlling motivation to eat. The  NAc and VP play special roles in mediating the hedonic impact (\"liking\") and motivational incentive salience (\"wanting\") of food rewards, and their interactions with LH help permit regulatory hunger/satiety modulation of food motivation and reward. Here, we review some progress that has been made regarding this circuitry and its functions: the identification of localized anatomical hedonic hotspots within NAc and VP for enhancing hedonic impact; interactions of  NAc/VP hedonic hotspots with specific LH signals such as orexin; an anterior-posterior gradient of sites in NAc shell for producing intense appetitive eating vs. intense fearful reactions; and anatomically distributed appetitive functions of dopamine and mu opioid signals in NAc shell and related structures. Such findings help improve our understanding of NAc, VP, and LH interactions in mediating affective and motivation functions, including \"liking\"  and \"wanting\" for food rewards.", "25950633": "Pleasure is mediated by well-developed mesocorticolimbic circuitry and serves adaptive functions. In affective disorders, anhedonia (lack of pleasure) or dysphoria (negative affect) can result from breakdowns of that hedonic system. Human neuroimaging studies indicate that surprisingly similar circuitry is activated by quite diverse pleasures, suggesting a common neural currency shared  by all. Wanting for reward is generated by a large and distributed brain system.  Liking, or pleasure itself, is generated by a smaller set of hedonic hot spots within limbic circuitry. Those hot spots also can be embedded in broader anatomical patterns of valence organization, such as in a keyboard pattern of nucleus accumbens generators for desire versus dread. In contrast, some of the best known textbook candidates for pleasure generators, including classic pleasure electrodes and the mesolimbic dopamine system, may not generate pleasure after all. These emerging insights into brain pleasure mechanisms may eventually  facilitate better treatments for affective disorders.", "23463152": "Orexin (hypocretin) is implicated in stimulating appetite as well as arousal, and in both food reward and drug reward. The ventral pallidum (VP) receives orexin projections from lateral hypothalamus neurons (LH), and orexin terminals are especially dense in the posterior half of VP, which is also the location of an opioid hedonic hotspot. The VP hotspot is a roughly cubic-millimeter site where mu opioid stimulation can amplify the hedonic impact of sweetness, expressed as an increase in 'liking' reactions to sucrose taste. The anatomical overlap in posterior VP between opioid hotspot and orexin inputs raises the possibility that the hedonic hotspot might allow orexin to amplify 'liking' too. We examined whether microinjections of orexin-A into the VP hotspot enhance the hedonic impact of sucrose, as assessed via affective taste reactivity measures of 'liking' reactions, and additionally compared effects at nearby sites in adjacent LH and extended amygdala. Taste reactivity results indicated that orexin stimulation specifically in the VP hotspot nearly doubled the magnitude of positive 'liking' reactions elicited by the taste of sucrose. Mapping results for localization of function, aided by Fos plume measures of the local spread of orexin impact, suggested that hedonic enhancement was generated by essentially the same cubic-millimeter of posterior VP previously identified as the opioid hotspot. By contrast, microinjection sites in the anterior half of VP, or in LH or extended amygdala, generally failed to produce any hedonic enhancement. We conclude that an orexin hedonic hotspot exists in posterior VP, with similar boundaries to the opioid hotspot. An orexin hedonic hotspot may permit regulatory hypothalamic circuitry to make foods more 'liked' during hunger by acting through VP. Dysfunction in a VP orexin hotspot in addiction or mood disorders might also  contribute to some types of affective psychopathology.", "23016694": "Drug addiction and obesity appear to share several properties. Both can be defined as disorders in which the saliency of a specific type of reward (food or  drug) becomes exaggerated relative to, and at the expense of others rewards. Both drugs and food have powerful reinforcing effects, which are in part mediated by abrupt dopamine increases in the brain reward centres. The abrupt dopamine increases, in vulnerable individuals, can override the brain's homeostatic control mechanisms. These parallels have generated interest in understanding the  shared vulnerabilities between addiction and obesity. Predictably, they also engendered a heated debate. Specifically, brain imaging studies are beginning to  uncover common features between these two conditions and delineate some of the overlapping brain circuits whose dysfunctions may underlie the observed deficits. The combined results suggest that both obese and drug-addicted individuals suffer from impairments in dopaminergic pathways that regulate neuronal systems associated not only with reward sensitivity and incentive motivation, but also with conditioning, self-control, stress reactivity and interoceptive awareness. In parallel, studies are also delineating differences between them that centre on the key role that peripheral signals involved with homeostatic control exert on food intake. Here, we focus on the shared neurobiological substrates of obesity and addiction.", "22514316": "Failures of self-regulation are common, leading to many of the most vexing problems facing contemporary society, from overeating and obesity to impulsive sexual behavior and STDs. One reason that people may be prone to engaging in unwanted behaviors is heightened sensitivity to cues related to those behaviors;  people may overeat because of hyperresponsiveness to food cues, addicts may relapse following exposure to their drug of choice, and some people might engage  in impulsive sexual activity because they are easily aroused by erotic stimuli. An open question is the extent to which individual differences in neural cue reactivity relate to actual behavioral outcomes. Here we show that individual differences in human reward-related brain activity in the nucleus accumbens to food and sexual images predict subsequent weight gain and sexual activity 6 months later. These findings suggest that heightened reward responsivity in the brain to food and sexual cues is associated with indulgence in overeating and sexual activity, respectively, and provide evidence for a common neural mechanism associated with appetitive behaviors.", "18955088": "In recent years the ventral pallidum has become a focus of great research interest as a mechanism of reward and incentive motivation. As a major output for limbic signals, the ventral pallidum was once associated primarily with motor functions rather than regarded as a reward structure in its own right. However, ample evidence now suggests that ventral pallidum function is a major mechanism of reward in the brain. We review data indicating that (1) an intact ventral pallidum is necessary for normal reward and motivation, (2) stimulated activation of ventral pallidum is sufficient to cause reward and motivation enhancements, and (3) activation patterns in ventral pallidum neurons specifically encode reward and motivation signals via phasic bursts of excitation to incentive and hedonic stimuli. We conclude that the ventral pallidum may serve as an important  'limbic final common pathway' for mesocorticolimbic processing of many rewards.", "16885520": "The ventral pallidum (VP) is a key structure in brain mesocorticolimbic reward circuits that mediate \"liking\" reactions to sensory pleasures. Do firing patterns in VP actually code sensory pleasure? Strong evidence for hedonic coding requires showing that neural signals track positive increases in sensory pleasure or even  reversals from bad to good. A useful test is the salt alliesthesia of physiological sodium depletion that makes even aversively intense NaCl taste become palatable and \"liked.\" We compared VP neural firing activity in rats during aversive \"disliking\" reactions elicited by a noxiously intense NaCl taste  (triple-seawater 1.5 M concentration) in normal homeostatic state versus in a physiological salt appetite state that made the same NaCl taste palatable and elicit positive \"liking\" reactions. We also compared firing elicited by palatable sucrose taste, which always elicited \"liking\" reactions in both states. A dramatic doubling in the amplitude of VP neural firing peaks to NaCl was caused by salt appetite that matched the affective switch from aversive (\"disliking\") to positive hedonic (\"liking\") reactions. By contrast, VP neural activity to \"liked\" sucrose taste was always high and never altered. In summary, VP firing activity selectively tracks the hedonic values of tastes, even across hedonic reversals caused by physiological changes. Our data provide the strongest evidence yet for  neural hedonic coding of natural sensory pleasures and suggest, by extension, how abnormalities in VP firing patterns might contribute to clinical hedonic dysfunctions.", "16177031": "How are natural reward functions such as sucrose hedonic impact and the motivation to eat generated within the ventral pallidum (VP)? Here, we used a novel microinjection and functional mapping procedure to neuroanatomically localize and neurochemically characterize substrates in the VP that mediate increases in eating behavior and enhancements in taste hedonic \"liking\" reactions. The mu-opioid agonist D-Ala2-N-Me-Phe4-Glycol5-enkephalin (DAMGO) caused increased hedonic \"liking\" reactions to sucrose only in the posterior VP but conversely suppressed \"liking\" reactions in the anterior and central VP. DAMGO similarly stimulated eating behavior in the posterior and central VP and suppressed eating in the anterior VP. In contrast, the GABAA antagonist bicuculline increased eating behavior at all VP sites, yet completely failed to enhance sucrose \"liking\" reactions at any site. These results reveal that VP generation of increased food reward and increased eating behavior is related but  dissociable. Hedonic \"liking\" and eating are systematically mapped in a neuroanatomically and neurochemically interactive manner in the VP.", "11210998": "BACKGROUND: The cerebral mechanisms underlying the behaviours that lead to pathological overeating and obesity are poorly understood. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that modulates rewarding properties of food, is likely to be involved. To test the hypothesis that obese individuals have abnormalities in brain dopamine activity we measured the availability of dopamine D2 receptors in  brain. METHODS: Brain dopamine D2 receptor availability was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]raclopride (a radioligand for the dopamine D2 receptor). Bmax/Kd (ratio of the distribution volumes in striatum to that in cerebellum minus 1) was used as a measure of dopamine D2 receptor availability. Brain glucose metabolism was also assessed with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). FINDINGS: Striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability was significantly lower in the ten obese individuals (2.47 [SD 0.36]) than in controls (2.99 [0.41]; p < or  = 0.0075). In the obese individuals body mass index (BMI) correlated negatively with the measures of D2 receptors (r=0.84; p < or = 0.002); the individuals with  the lowest D2 values had the largest BMI. By contrast, neither whole brain nor striatal metabolism differed between obese individuals and controls, indicating that striatal reductions in D2 receptors were not due to a systematic reduction in radiotracer delivery. INTERPRETATION: The availability of dopamine D2 receptor was decreased in obese individuals in proportion to their BMI. Dopamine modulates motivation and reward  circuits and hence dopamine deficiency in obese individuals may perpetuate pathological eating as a means to compensate for decreased activation of these circuits. Strategies aimed at improving dopamine function may be beneficial in the treatment of obese individuals.", "10817843": "To successfully negotiate the developmental transition between youth and adulthood, adolescents must maneuver this often stressful period while acquiring  skills necessary for independence. Certain behavioral features, including age-related increases in social behavior and risk-taking/novelty-seeking, are common among adolescents of diverse mammalian species and may aid in this process. Reduced positive incentive values from stimuli may lead adolescents to pursue new appetitive reinforcers through drug use and other risk-taking behaviors, with their relative insensitivity to drugs supporting comparatively greater per occasion use. Pubertal increases in gonadal hormones are a hallmark of adolescence, although there is little evidence for a simple association of these hormones with behavioral change during adolescence. Prominent developmental transformations are seen in prefrontal cortex and limbic brain regions of adolescents across a variety of species, alterations that include an apparent shift in the balance between mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine systems. Developmental changes in these stressor-sensitive regions, which are critical for attributing incentive salience to drugs and other stimuli, likely contribute to the unique characteristics of adolescence.", "8401595": "This paper presents a biopsychological theory of drug addiction, the 'Incentive-Sensitization Theory'. The theory addresses three fundamental questions. The first is: why do addicts crave drugs? That is, what is the psychological and neurobiological basis of drug craving? The second is: why does  drug craving persist even after long periods of abstinence? The third is whether  'wanting' drugs (drug craving) is attributable to 'liking' drugs (to the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs)? The theory posits the following. (1) Addictive drugs share the ability to enhance mesotelencephalic dopamine neurotransmission. (2) One psychological function of this neural system is to attribute 'incentive salience' to the perception and mental representation of events associated with activation of the system. Incentive salience is a psychological process that transforms the perception of stimuli, imbuing them with salience, making them attractive, 'wanted', incentive stimuli. (3) In some individuals the repeated use of addictive drugs produces incremental neuroadaptations in this neural system, rendering it increasingly and perhaps permanently, hypersensitive ('sensitized') to drugs and drug-associated stimuli.  The sensitization of dopamine systems is gated by associative learning, which causes excessive incentive salience to be attributed to the act of drug taking and to stimuli associated with drug taking. It is specifically the sensitization  of incentive salience, therefore, that transforms ordinary 'wanting' into excessive drug craving. (4) It is further proposed that sensitization of the neural systems responsible for incentive salience ('for wanting') can occur independently of changes in neural systems that mediate the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs (drug 'liking') and of neural systems that mediate withdrawal. Thus, sensitization of incentive salience can produce addictive behavior (compulsive drug seeking and drug taking) even if the expectation of drug pleasure or the aversive properties of withdrawal are diminished and even in the face of strong disincentives, including the loss of reputation, job, home and family. We review evidence for this view of addiction and discuss its implications for understanding the psychology and neurobiology of addiction.", "27256556": "The dopamine system is unique among the brain's modulatory systems in that it has discrete projections to specific brain regions involved in motor behaviour, cognition and emotion. Dopamine neurons exhibit several activity patterns - including tonic and phasic firing - that are determined by a combination of endogenous pacemaker conductances and regulation by multiple afferent systems. Emerging evidence suggests that disruptions in these regulatory systems may underlie the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and depression.", "25234264": "The precise functional role of the hippocampus remains a topic of much debate. The dominant view is that the dorsal (or posterior) hippocampus is implicated in  memory and spatial navigation and the ventral (or anterior) hippocampus mediates  anxiety-related behaviours. However, this 'dichotomy view' may need revision. Gene expression studies demonstrate multiple functional domains along the hippocampal long axis, which often exhibit sharply demarcated borders. By contrast, anatomical studies and electrophysiological recordings in rodents suggest that the long axis is organized along a gradient. Together, these observations suggest a model in which functional long-axis gradients are superimposed on discrete functional domains. This model provides a potential framework to explain and test the multiple functions ascribed to the hippocampus.", "20152109": "One literature treats the hippocampus as a purely cognitive structure involved in memory; another treats it as a regulator of emotion whose dysfunction leads to psychopathology. We review behavioral, anatomical, and gene expression studies that together support a functional segmentation into three hippocampal compartments: dorsal, intermediate, and ventral. The dorsal hippocampus, which corresponds to the posterior hippocampus in primates, performs primarily cognitive functions. The ventral (anterior in primates) relates to stress, emotion, and affect. Strikingly, gene expression in the dorsal hippocampus correlates with cortical regions involved in information processing, while genes  expressed in the ventral hippocampus correlate with regions involved in emotion and stress (amygdala and hypothalamus).", "22992525": "Stressors motivate an array of adaptive responses ranging from 'fight or flight'  to an internal urgency signal facilitating long-term goals. However, traumatic or chronic uncontrollable stress promotes the onset of major depressive disorder, in which acute stressors lose their motivational properties and are perceived as insurmountable impediments. Consequently, stress-induced depression is a debilitating human condition characterized by an affective shift from engagement  of the environment to withdrawal. An emerging neurobiological substrate of depression and associated pathology is the nucleus accumbens, a region with the capacity to mediate a diverse range of stress responses by interfacing limbic, cognitive and motor circuitry. Here we report that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), a neuropeptide released in response to acute stressors and other arousing  environmental stimuli, acts in the nucleus accumbens of naive mice to increase dopamine release through coactivation of the receptors CRFR1 and CRFR2. Remarkably, severe-stress exposure completely abolished this effect without recovery for at least 90\u2009days. This loss of CRF's capacity to regulate dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens is accompanied by a switch in the reaction to CRF from appetitive to aversive, indicating a diametric change in the emotional response to acute stressors. Thus, the current findings offer a biological substrate for the switch in affect which is central to stress-induced depressive  disorders.", "12640666": "The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) participates in the functional  integration of limbic cortical and striatal circuitry. In the rat, the PVT projects to the deep layers of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and to the shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the synaptic organization of PVT afferents within these regions remains undescribed. Furthermore, although dopamine (DA) modulates excitatory glutamate transmission in both areas, possible anatomic substrates for specific DA modulation of PVT inputs have not yet been investigated. To address these issues, immunoperoxidase labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in DA axons was combined with anterograde tract-tracing, either  by biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) labeled with immunogold-silver or by degeneration after lesions of the PVT. In both regions, and with either tracing method, PVT terminals formed primarily asymmetric axospinous synapses; in the NAc, a proportion of PVT terminals also synapsed onto dendrites. PVT profiles in  both regions were often seen in direct apposition to TH-immunoreactive axons; this association was more evident in the NAc where the DA innervation is denser.  Within the PFC, PVT profiles and TH-labeled axons were occasionally apposed to the same dendrites, but synaptic specializations were not typically seen at these seeming points of convergence. Within the NAc, PVT profiles occasionally made synapses onto spines and distal dendrites that received convergent synapses from  TH-immunoreactive varicosities. These findings represent the first demonstration  of postsynaptic convergence between DA and thalamic afferents to a striatal region and are consistent with direct synaptic modulation of PVT transmission by  DA in the NAc but not the PFC.", "23742917": "These studies examined the roles of dopamine D1- and D2-like receptors within the nucleus accumbens (Acb) in the acquisition and expression of ethanol-induced (2g/kg) conditioned place preference (CPP) in adult male DBA/2J mice. Bilateral intra-Acb infusions of the D1-like dopamine receptor antagonist SCH23390 (0.05, 0.5\u03bcg/side) or the D2-like dopamine receptor antagonist raclopride (0.5-5.0\u03bcg/side) were administered 30min before each ethanol conditioning trial (acquisition studies) or before preference tests (expression studies). CPP was conditioned to tactile cues using an unbiased apparatus and procedure. Intra-Acb  infusion of SCH23390 prevented CPP acquisition, whereas intra-Acb infusion of raclopride did not. Intra-Acb infusion of both antagonists, however, dose-dependently reduced ethanol-stimulated locomotor activity during conditioning. In contrast, intra-Acb antagonist infusion had no effect on ethanol CPP expression, suggesting that dopamine's role in the Acb is limited to neurobiological processes engaged during the learning of the relationship between contextual cues and ethanol reward. Control experiments showed that intra-Acb injection of SCH23390 alone produced no place conditioning and did not interfere  with the acquisition of conditioned place aversion induced by lithium chloride, suggesting that the antagonist's effect on ethanol CPP was not due to a more general detrimental effect on associative learning. Overall, these data suggest that D1-like (but not D2-like) dopamine Acb receptors play an important role in the learning of context-ethanol associations, either by modulating the magnitude  of ethanol reward or the rate of learning about ethanol reward.", "21161749": "Abuse of psychoactive substances can lead to drug addiction. In animals, addiction is best modeled by drug self-administration paradigms. It has been proposed that the crucial common denominator for the development of drug addiction is the ability of drugs of abuse to increase extracellular concentrations of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Studies using in vivo microdialysis and chronoamperometry in the behaving animal have demonstrated that drugs of abuse increase tonic dopamine concentrations in the NAcc. However, it is known that dopamine neurons respond to reward-related stimuli on a subsecond timescale. Thus, it is necessary to collect neurochemical information with this level of temporal resolution, as achieved with in vivo fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), to fully understand the role of phasic dopamine release in normal behavior and drug addiction. We review studies that investigated the effects of drugs of abuse on NAcc dopamine levels in freely moving animals using  in vivo microdialysis, chronoamperometry, and FSCV. After a brief introduction of dopamine signal transduction and anatomy and a section on current theories on the role of dopamine in natural goal-directed behavior, a discussion of techniques for the in vivo assessment of extracellular dopamine in behaving animals is presented. Then, we review studies using these techniques to investigate changes  in phasic and tonic dopamine signaling in the NAcc during (1) response-dependent  and -independent administration of abused drugs, (2) the presentation of drug-conditioned stimuli and operant behavior in self-administration paradigms, (3) drug withdrawal, and (4) cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. These results are then integrated with current ideas on the role of dopamine in addiction with an emphasis on a model illustrating phasic and tonic NAcc dopamine signaling during different stages of drug addiction. This model predicts that phasic dopamine release in response to drug-related stimuli will be enhanced over stimuli associated with natural reinforcers, which may result in aberrant goal-directed behaviors contributing to drug addiction.", "18802002": "Using sensory information for the prediction of future events is essential for survival. Midbrain dopamine neurons are activated by environmental cues that predict rewards, but the cellular mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain elusive. We used in vivo voltammetry and in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiology to show that both dopamine release to reward predictive cues and enhanced synaptic strength onto dopamine neurons develop over the course of cue-reward learning. Increased synaptic strength was not observed after stable behavioral responding. Thus, enhanced synaptic strength onto dopamine neurons may act to facilitate the transformation of neutral environmental stimuli to salient reward-predictive cues.", "16738243": "Neurotransmitter release in the nucleus accumbens core (NACore) during the acquisition of remifentanil or cocaine reinforcement was determined in an operant runway procedure by simultaneous tandem mass spectrometric analysis of dopamine,  acetylcholine, and remifentanil or cocaine itself. Run times for remifentanil or  cocaine continually decreased over the five consecutive runs of the experiment. Intra-NACore dopamine, acetylcholine, and drug peaked with each intravenous remifentanil or cocaine self-administration and decreased to pre-run baseline with half-lives of approximately 10 min. As expected, remifentanil or cocaine peaks did not vary between the five runs. Surprisingly, however, drug-contingent  dopamine peaks also did not change over the five runs, whereas acetylcholine peaks did. Thus, the acquisition of drug reinforcement was paralleled by a continuous increase in acetylcholine overflow in the NACore, whereas the overflow of dopamine, the expected prime neurotransmitter candidate for conditioning in drug reinforcement, did not increase. Local intra-accumbens administration by reverse microdialysis of either atropine or mecamylamine completely and reversibly blocked the acquisition of remifentanil reinforcement. Our findings suggest that activation of muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the NACore by acetylcholine volume transmission is necessary during the acquisition phase of drug reinforcement conditioning.", "11027236": "The nucleus accumbens, a brain structure ideally situated to act as an interface  between corticolimbic information-processing regions and motor output systems, is well known to subserve behaviors governed by natural reinforcers. In the accumbens core, glutamatergic input from its corticolimbic afferents and dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area converge onto common dendrites of the medium spiny neurons that populate the accumbens. We have previously found that blockade of NMDA receptors in the core with the antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5; 5 nmol) abolishes acquisition but not performance of an appetitive instrumental learning task (Kelley et al., 1997). Because it is currently hypothesized that concurrent dopamine D(1) and glutamate  receptor activation is required for long-term changes associated with plasticity, we wished to examine whether the dopamine system in the accumbens core modulates  learning via NMDA receptors. Co-infusion of low doses of the D(1) receptor antagonist SCH-23390 (0.3 nmol) and AP-5 (0.5 nmol) into the accumbens core strongly impaired acquisition of instrumental learning (lever pressing for food), whereas when infused separately, these low doses had no effect. Infusion of the combined low doses had no effect on indices of feeding and motor activity, suggesting a specific effect on learning. We hypothesize that co-activation of NMDA and D(1) receptors in the nucleus accumbens core is a key process for acquisition of appetitive instrumental learning. Such an interaction is likely to promote intracellular events and gene regulation necessary for synaptic plasticity and is supported by a number of cellular models.", "9309321": "One of the functions of the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is to regulate the process of reinforcement, a process that is thought to influence drug self-administration. This study tested the effects of centrally administered DA receptor ligands on ethanol self-administration behavior. Long-Evans rats were trained to lever press on a fixed-ratio 4 schedule of ethanol (10% v/v) reinforcement. DA agonists and antagonists were then bilaterally microinjected (0.5 microliter/side) into the nucleus accumbens (N Acc) 10-min before sessions to test for effects on the onset, maintenance, and termination of ethanol self-administration. Infusions of the D1-like agonist SKF 38393 (0.03 to 3.0 micrograms) produced no effect on ethanol self-administration. The D1-like antagonist SCH 23390 (0.5 to 2.0 micrograms) reduced total responding by decreasing the time course of self-administration without altering response rate. The D2-like agonist quinpirole produced a biphasic effect on self-administration. Quinpirole (1.0 microgram) increased total responses and response rate, whereas higher doses (4.0 to 10.0 micrograms) decreased total responding as a result of early termination. The D2-like antagonist raclopride (0.1 to 1.0 microgram) reduced total responding by decreasing time course and response rate. Co-administration of either SKF 38393 or SCH 23390 with quinpirole prevented the  behavioral effects observed with the low doses of quinpirole. Thus, in the N Acc  either increased activation of D1-like receptors or their blockade can affect the expression of the behavioral effects of the D2-like agonist. This suggests that some intermediate level of D1 activation is required to observe the D2 effect. The decreases in total responding produced by raclopride were enhanced by co-administration of SKF 38393, but not altered by SCH 23390, thus suggesting that D1-like and D2-like receptors in the N Acc interact in the regulation of ethanol self-administration in a manner similar to their interactive regulation of other behaviors.", "22978651": "The identification and functional understanding of the neurocircuitry that mediates alcohol and drug effects that are relevant for the development of addictive behavior is a fundamental challenge in addiction research. Here we introduce an assumption-free construction of a neurocircuitry that mediates acute and chronic drug effects on neurotransmitter dynamics that is solely based on rodent neuroanatomy. Two types of data were considered for constructing the neurocircuitry: (1) information on the cytoarchitecture and neurochemical connectivity of each brain region of interest obtained from different neuroanatomical techniques; (2) information on the functional relevance of each region of interest with respect to alcohol and drug effects. We used mathematical data mining and hierarchical clustering methods to achieve the highest standards  in the preprocessing of these data. Using this approach, a dynamical network of high molecular and spatial resolution containing 19 brain regions and seven neurotransmitter systems was obtained. Further graph theoretical analysis suggests that the neurocircuitry is connected and cannot be separated into further components. Our analysis also reveals the existence of a principal core subcircuit comprised of nine brain regions: the prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, amygdala, thalamus, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and raphe nuclei. Finally, by means of algebraic criteria  for synchronizability of the neurocircuitry, the suitability for in silico modeling of acute and chronic drug effects is indicated. Indeed, we introduced as an example a dynamical system for modeling the effects of acute ethanol administration in rats and obtained an increase in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens-a hallmark of drug reinforcement-to an extent similar to that seen in numerous microdialysis studies. We conclude that the present neurocircuitry provides a structural and dynamical framework for large-scale mathematical models and will help to predict chronic drug effects on brain function.", "20672914": "OBJECT: The authors tested the hypothesis that deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) decreases alcohol intake in alcohol-preferring (P) rats after each animal has established a stable, large alcohol intake and after P rats with an established intake have been deprived of alcohol for 4-6 weeks. METHODS: Bipolar stimulating electrodes were bilaterally placed in the NAcc using stereotactic coordinates. In the first study, P rats (9 animals) were allowed to  establish a stable pattern of alcohol intake (about 5-7 g/day) over approximately 2 weeks, and the acute effects of DBS in the NAcc (140-150 Hz, 60-microsec pulse  width, and 200-microA current intensity) on alcohol intake and alcohol preference were studied. Each animal acted as its own control and received 1 hour of DBS followed by 1 hour of sham-DBS or vice versa on each of 2 sequential days. The order of testing (sham-DBS vs DBS) was randomized. In the second study, each animal was allowed to establish a stable alcohol intake and then the animal was deprived of alcohol for 4-6 weeks. Animals received DBS (6 rats) or sham-DBS (5 rats) in the NAcc for 24 hours starting when alcohol was reintroduced to each animal. RESULTS: Deep brain stimulation in the NAcc, as compared with a period of sham-DBS treatment in the same animals, acutely decreased alcohol preference. Furthermore, alcohol consumption and preference were significantly reduced in the DBS group compared with the sham treatment group during the first 24 hours that alcohol was made available after a period of forced abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: The NAcc plays a key role in the rewarding and subsequent addictive  properties of drugs of abuse in general and of alcohol in particular. Deep brain  stimulation in the NAcc reduced alcohol consumption in P rats both acutely and after a period of alcohol deprivation. Therefore, DBS in the NAcc coupled with other neurophysiological measurements may be a useful tool in determining the role of the NAcc in the mesocorticolimbic reward circuit. Deep brain stimulation  in the NAcc may also be an effective treatment for reducing alcohol consumption in patients who abuse alcohol and have not responded to other forms of therapy.", "19463262": "Recent studies have shown that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) has an inhibitory effect on drug-seeking behaviors including reinstatement responding for cocaine. The objective of the present study was to expand on these findings by assessing the effects of DBS on behaviors related to  alcohol consumption. The specific aim of this study was to determine whether DBS  delivered to either the shell or core of the NAcc would reduce ETOH intake in rats using a two-bottle choice limited access procedure. Long Evans rats were induced to drink a 10% ethanol solution using a saccharin fading procedure. Bipolar electrodes were implanted bilaterally into either the core or shell of the NAcc. During testing animals received DBS 5 min prior to and during a 30-minute test session in which both ETOH and water bottles were accessible. Current was delivered at amplitudes ranging from 0 to 150 microA. ETOH consumption was significantly reduced from baseline levels at the 150 microA current for both shell and core electrode placements. A significant current effect was not found for water consumption for either site. These results provide evidence that DBS delivered either to the nucleus accumbens core or shell subregions can significantly reduce ethanol intake in the rat.", "17878197": "Chronic consumption of alcohol represents one of the greatest health and socioeconomic problems worldwide. We report on a 54-year-old patient with a severe anxiety disorder and secondary depressive disorder in whom bilateral deep  brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens was carried out. Despite the absence of desired improvement in his primary disorder, we observed a remarkable  although not primarily intended alleviation of the patient's comorbid alcohol dependency. Our case report demonstrates the extremely effective treatment of alcohol dependency by means of DBS of the nucleus accumbens and may reveal new prospects in overcoming therapy resistance in dependencies in general.", "21420853": "Extensive evidence implicates the ventral striatum in multiple distinct facets of action selection. Early work established a role in modulating ongoing behavior, as engaged by the energizing and directing influences of motivationally relevant  cues and the willingness to expend effort in order to obtain reward. More recently, reinforcement learning models have suggested the notion of ventral striatum primarily as an evaluation step during learning, which serves as a critic to update a separate actor. Recent computational and experimental work may provide a resolution to the differences between these two theories through a careful parsing of behavior and the instrinsic heterogeneity that characterizes this complex structure.", "21414906": "A functional interaction between the hippocampal formation and the ventral striatum is thought to contribute to the learning and expression of associations  between places and rewards. However, the mechanism of how such associations may be learned and used is currently unknown. We recorded neural ensembles and local  field potentials from the ventral striatum and CA1 simultaneously as rats ran a modified T-maze. Theta-modulated cells in ventral striatum almost invariably showed firing phase precession relative to the hippocampal theta rhythm. Across the population of ventral striatal cells, phase precession was preferentially associated with an anticipatory ramping of activity up to the reward sites. In contrast, CA1 population activity and phase precession were distributed more uniformly. Ventral striatal phase precession was stronger to hippocampal than ventral striatal theta and was accompanied by increased theta coherence with hippocampus, suggesting that this effect is hippocampally derived. These results  suggest that the firing phase of ventral striatal neurons contains motivationally relevant information and that phase precession serves to bind hippocampal place representations to ventral striatal representations of reward.", "18596169": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been implicated in a variety of associative processes that are dependent on the integrity of the amygdala and hippocampus (HPC). However, the extent to which the two subregions of the NAc, the core and shell, form differentiated circuits within the amygdala- and hippocampal-ventral  striatal circuitry remains unclear. The present study investigated the effects of selective excitotoxic lesions of the nucleus accumbens shell or core subregion on appetitive elemental cue and context conditioning, shown previously to be dependent on the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus, respectively. Rats were trained sequentially to acquire discrete conditioned stimulus-sucrose conditioning, followed by spatial context-sucrose conditioning in a place preference apparatus characterized by three topographically identical chambers, the chambers being discriminable only on the basis of path integration. NAc shell lesions selectively impaired the acquisition of conditioned place preference and  the use of spatial information to retrieve information about a discrete cue, whereas, as expected, NAc core lesions attenuated the acquisition of cue conditioning compared with sham rats. In a subsequent experiment, disconnection of the HPC from the NAc shell using unilateral asymmetric lesions of each structure resulted in a pattern of impairment in place conditioning and context-dependent cue retrieval similar to that produced by NAc shell lesions. These data not only suggest that the NAc core and shell subregions subserve distinct associative processes but also that the NAc shell and HPC are important  functional components of a limbic corticostriatal network involved in spatial context conditioning.", "17093128": "When rats and mice are free to explore a familiar environment they spend more time in a previously rewarded location. This conditioned place preference (CPP) results from an increased probability of initiating transitions from an unrewarded location to one previously paired with reward. We recorded nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons while rats explored a three-room in-line apparatus. Before place conditioning, approximately equal proportions of NAc neurons show excitations or inhibitions when the rat is in each of the rooms (morphine paired, center or saline paired). Conditioning increased the proportion of neurons inhibited while the rat was in the morphine room and neurons excited in the saline room. Many of the neurons in these two groups responded during room transitions. Furthermore, the postconditioning increase in the population of neurons with room-selective responding persisted for several weeks after the last morphine treatment. This long-lasting change in population responses of NAc neurons to initially neutral locations is a neural correlate of the change in location preference manifest as CPP.", "10774721": "Author information:  (1)Secton on Molecular Plasticity, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.", "10400894": "Rats were given repeated injections of 10 mg/kg of morphine and were then left undisturbed for 24-25 days before their brains were processed for Golgi-Cox staining. Prior exposure to morphine decreased the complexity of dendritic branching and the number of dendritic spines on medium spiny neurons in the shell of the nucleus accumbens and on pyramidal cells in the prefrontal and parietal cortex. It is suggested that some of the long-term behavioral consequences of repeated exposure to morphine may be due to its ability to reorganize patterns of synaptic connectivity in the forebrain.", "9457173": "The diverse physiological actions of dopamine are mediated by at least five distinct G protein-coupled receptor subtypes. Two D1-like receptor subtypes (D1 and D5) couple to the G protein Gs and activate adenylyl cyclase. The other receptor subtypes belong to the D2-like subfamily (D2, D3, and D4) and are prototypic of G protein-coupled receptors that inhibit adenylyl cyclase and activate K+ channels. The genes for the D1 and D5 receptors are intronless, but pseudogenes of the D5 exist. The D2 and D3 receptors vary in certain tissues and  species as a result of alternative splicing, and the human D4 receptor gene exhibits extensive polymorphic variation. In the central nervous system, dopamine receptors are widely expressed because they are involved in the control of locomotion, cognition, emotion, and affect as well as neuroendocrine secretion. In the periphery, dopamine receptors are present more prominently in kidney, vasculature, and pituitary, where they affect mainly sodium homeostasis, vascular tone, and hormone secretion. Numerous genetic linkage analysis studies have failed so far to reveal unequivocal evidence for the involvement of one of these  receptors in the etiology of various central nervous system disorders. However, targeted deletion of several of these dopamine receptor genes in mice should provide valuable information about their physiological functions.", "1975644": "A dopamine receptor has been characterized which differs in its pharmacology and  signalling system from the D1 or D2 receptor and represents both an autoreceptor  and a postsynaptic receptor. The D3 receptor is localized to limbic areas of the  brain, which are associated with cognitive, emotional and endocrine functions. It seems to mediate some of the effects of antipsychotic drugs and drugs used against Parkinson's disease, that were previously thought to interact only with D2 receptors.", "26586182": "The factors causing the transition from recreational drug consumption to addiction remain largely unknown. It has not been tested whether dopamine (DA) is sufficient to trigger this process. Here we use optogenetic self-stimulation of DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to selectively mimic the defining  commonality of addictive drugs. All mice readily acquired self-stimulation. After weeks of abstinence, cue-induced relapse was observed in parallel with a potentiation of excitatory afferents onto D1 receptor-expressing neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). When the mice had to endure a mild electric foot shock to obtain a stimulation, some stopped while others persevered. The resistance to  punishment was associated with enhanced neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) while chemogenetic inhibition of the OFC reduced compulsivity. Together, these results show that stimulating VTA DA neurons induces behavioral and cellular hallmarks of addiction, indicating sufficiency for the induction and progression of the disease.", "26373473": "Brain endocannabinoid (eCB) signalling influences the motivation for natural rewards (such as palatable food, sexual activity and social interaction) and modulates the rewarding effects of addictive drugs. Pathological forms of natural and drug-induced reward are associated with dysregulated eCB signalling that may  derive from pre-existing genetic factors or from prolonged drug exposure. Impaired eCB signalling contributes to dysregulated synaptic plasticity, increased stress responsivity, negative emotional states and cravings that propel addiction. Understanding the contributions of eCB disruptions to behavioural and  physiological traits provides insight into the eCB influence on addiction vulnerability.", "24741047": "In light of recent studies suggesting that amphetamine (AMPH) increases electrically evoked dopamine release ([DA]o), we examined discrepancies between these findings and literature that has demonstrated AMPH-induced decreases in [DA]o. The current study has expanded the inventory of AMPH actions by defining two separate mechanisms of AMPH effects on [DA]o at high and low doses, one dopamine transporter (DAT) independent and one DAT dependent, respectively. AMPH  concentrations were measured via microdialysis in rat nucleus accumbens after intraperitoneal injections of 1 and 10 mg/kg and yielded values of \u223c10 and 200 nM, respectively. Subsequently, voltammetry in brain slices was used to examine the effects of low (10 nM), moderate (100 nM), and high (10 \u03bcM) concentrations of AMPH across a range of frequency stimulations (one pulse; five pulses, 20 Hz; 24  pulses, 60 Hz). We discovered biphasic, concentration-dependent effects in WT mice, in which AMPH increased [DA]o at low concentrations and decreased [DA]o at  high concentrations across all stimulation types. However, in slices from DAT-KO  mice, [DA]o was decreased by all concentrations of AMPH, demonstrating that AMPH-induced increases in [DA]o are DAT dependent, whereas the decreases at high  concentrations are DAT independent. We propose that low AMPH concentrations are insufficient to disrupt vesicular sequestration, and therefore AMPH acts solely as a DAT inhibitor to increase [DA]o. When AMPH concentrations are high, the added mechanism of vesicular depletion leads to reduced [DA]o. The biphasic mechanisms observed here confirm and extend the traditional actions of AMPH, but  do not support mechanisms involving increased exocytotic release.", "24733061": "The neural basis of positive reinforcement is often studied in the laboratory using intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), a simple behavioral model in which subjects perform an action in order to obtain exogenous stimulation of a specific brain area. Recently we showed that activation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons supports ICSS behavior, consistent with proposed roles of this neural population in reinforcement learning. However, VTA dopamine neurons make connections with diverse brain regions, and the specific efferent target(s) that  mediate the ability of dopamine neuron activation to support ICSS have not been definitively demonstrated. Here, we examine in transgenic rats whether dopamine neuron-specific ICSS relies on the connection between the VTA and the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region also implicated in positive reinforcement. We find that optogenetic activation of dopaminergic terminals innervating the NAc is sufficient to drive ICSS, and that ICSS driven by optical activation of dopamine  neuron somata in the VTA is significantly attenuated by intra-NAc injections of D1 or D2 receptor antagonists. These data demonstrate that the NAc is a critical  efferent target sustaining dopamine neuron-specific ICSS, identify receptor subtypes through which dopamine acts to promote this behavior, and ultimately help to refine our understanding of the neural circuitry mediating positive reinforcement.", "24656971": "Phasic increases in brain dopamine are required for cue-directed reward seeking.  Although compelling within the framework of appetitive behavior, the view that illicit drugs hijack reward circuits by hyperactivating these dopamine transients is inconsistent with established psychostimulant pharmacology. However, recent work reclassifying amphetamine (AMPH), cocaine, and other addictive dopamine-transporter inhibitors (DAT-Is) supports transient hyperactivation as a  unifying hypothesis of abused drugs. We argue here that reclassification also identifies generating burst firing by dopamine neurons as a keystone action. Unlike natural rewards, which are processed by sensory systems, drugs act directly on the brain. Consequently, to mimic natural rewards and exploit reward  circuits, dopamine transients must be elicited de novo. Of available drug targets, only burst firing achieves this essential outcome.", "23303926": "Drugs of abuse hijack brain-reward circuitry during the addiction process by augmenting action potential-dependent phasic dopamine release events associated with learning and goal-directed behavior. One prominent exception to this notion  would appear to be amphetamine (AMPH) and related analogs, which are proposed instead to disrupt normal patterns of dopamine neurotransmission by depleting vesicular stores and promoting nonexocytotic dopamine efflux via reverse transport. This mechanism of AMPH action, though, is inconsistent with its therapeutic effects and addictive properties, which are thought to be reliant on  phasic dopamine signaling. Here we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in freely moving rats to interrogate principal neurochemical responses to AMPH in the striatum and relate these changes to behavior. First, we showed that AMPH dose-dependently enhanced evoked dopamine responses to phasic-like current pulse  trains for up to 2 h. Modeling the data revealed that AMPH inhibited dopamine uptake but also unexpectedly potentiated vesicular dopamine release. Second, we found that AMPH increased the amplitude, duration, and frequency of spontaneous dopamine transients, the naturally occurring, nonelectrically evoked, phasic increases in extracellular dopamine. Finally, using an operant sugar reward paradigm, we showed that low-dose AMPH augmented dopamine transients elicited by  sugar-predictive cues. However, operant behavior failed at high-dose AMPH, which  was due to phasic dopamine hyperactivity and the decoupling of dopamine transients from the reward predictive cue. These findings identify upregulation of exocytotic dopamine release as a key AMPH action in behaving animals and support a unified mechanism of abused drugs to activate phasic dopamine signaling.", "22296263": "Mesolimbic dopamine neurons fire in both tonic and phasic modes resulting in detectable extracellular levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In the past, different techniques have targeted dopamine levels in the NAc to establish a basal concentration. In this study, we used in vivo fast scan cyclic  voltammetry (FSCV) in the NAc of awake, freely moving rats. The experiments were  primarily designed to capture changes in dopamine caused by phasic firing - that  is, the measurement of dopamine 'transients'. These FSCV measurements revealed for the first time that spontaneous dopamine transients constitute a major component of extracellular dopamine levels in the NAc. A series of experiments were designed to probe regulation of extracellular dopamine. Lidocaine was infused into the ventral tegmental area, the site of dopamine cell bodies, to arrest neuronal firing. While there was virtually no instantaneous change in dopamine concentration, longer sampling revealed a decrease in dopamine transients and a time-averaged decrease in the extracellular level. Dopamine transporter inhibition using intravenous GBR12909 injections increased extracellular dopamine levels changing both frequency and size of dopamine transients in the NAc. To further unmask the mechanics governing extracellular dopamine levels we used intravenous injection of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) inhibitor, tetrabenazine, to deplete dopamine storage and increase cytoplasmic dopamine in the nerve terminals. Tetrabenazine almost abolished phasic dopamine release but increased extracellular dopamine to \u223c500\u2003nM, presumably by inducing reverse transport by dopamine transporter (DAT).  Taken together, data presented here show that average extracellular dopamine in the NAc is low (20-30\u2003nM) and largely arises from phasic dopamine transients.", "21338876": "The fundamental principle that unites addictive drugs appears to be that each enhances synaptic dopamine by means that dissociate it from normal behavioral control, so that they act to reinforce their own acquisition. This occurs via the modulation of synaptic mechanisms that can be involved in learning, including enhanced excitation or disinhibition of dopamine neuron activity, blockade of dopamine reuptake, and altering the state of the presynaptic terminal to enhance  evoked over basal transmission. Amphetamines offer an exception to such modulation in that they combine multiple effects to produce nonexocytic stimulation-independent release of neurotransmitter via reverse transport independent from normal presynaptic function. Questions about the molecular actions of\u00a0addictive drugs, prominently including the actions of alcohol and solvents, remain unresolved, but their ability to co-opt normal presynaptic functions helps to explain why treatment for addiction has been challenging.", "19211880": "Dopamine concentrations fluctuate on a subsecond time scale in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of awake rats. These transients occur in resting animals, are more frequent following administration of drugs of abuse, and become time-locked  to cues predicting reward. Despite their importance in various behaviors, the origin of these signals has not been demonstrated. Here we show that dopamine transients are evoked by neural activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a brain region containing dopaminergic cell bodies. The frequency of naturally occurring dopamine transients in a resting, awake animal was reduced by a local VTA microinfusion of either lidocaine or (+/-)2-amino,5-phosphopentanoic acid (AP-5), an NMDA receptor antagonist that attenuates phasic firing. When dopamine  increases were pharmacologically evoked by noncontingent administration of cocaine, intra-VTA infusion of lidocaine or AP-5 significantly diminished this effect. Dopamine transients acquired in response to a cue during intracranial self-stimulation were also attenuated by intra-VTA microinfusion of AP-5, and this was accompanied by an increase in latency to lever press. The results from these three distinct experiments directly demonstrate, for the first time, how neuronal firing of dopamine neurons originating in the VTA translates into synaptic overflow in a key terminal region, the NAc shell.", "17251418": "Transient surges of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens are associated with drug seeking. Using a voltammetric sensor with high temporal and spatial resolution, we demonstrate differences in the temporal profile of dopamine concentration transients caused by acute doses of nicotine, ethanol, and cocaine in the nucleus accumbens shell of freely moving rats. Despite differential release dynamics, all drug effects are uniformly inhibited by administration of rimonabant, a cannabinoid receptor (CB1) antagonist, suggesting that an increase in endocannabinoid tone facilitates the effects of commonly abused drugs on subsecond dopamine release. These time-resolved chemical measurements provide unique insight into the neurobiological effectiveness of rimonabant in treating addictive disorders.", "16006505": "Dopamine neurotransmission has been implicated in the modulation of many cognitive processes. Both rapid (phasic) and slower (tonic) changes in its extracellular concentration contribute to its complex actions. Fast in vivo electrochemical techniques can measure extracellular dopamine on a rapid time scale but without the selectivity afforded with slower techniques that use chemical separations. Cyclic voltammetry improves chemical resolution over other  electrochemical methods, and it can resolve dopamine changes in the brains of behaving rodents over short epochs (<10 s). With this method, however, selective  detection of slower dopamine changes is still elusive. Here we demonstrate that principal component regression of cyclic voltammetry data enables quantification  of changes in dopamine and extracellular pH. Using this method, we show that cocaine modifies dopamine release in two ways: dopamine concentration transients  increase in frequency and magnitude, whereas a gradual increase in steady-state dopamine concentration occurs over 90 s.", "15955613": "Amphetamine and substituted amphetamines, including methamphetamine, methylphenidate (Ritalin), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), and the herbs khat and ephedra, encompass the only widely administered class of drugs that predominantly release neurotransmitter, in this case principally catecholamines,  by a non-exocytic mechanism. These drugs play important medicinal and social roles in many cultures, exert profound effects on mental function and behavior, and can produce neurodegeneration and addiction. Numerous questions remain regarding the unusual molecular mechanisms by which these compounds induce catecholamine release. We review current issues on the two apparent primary mechanisms--the redistribution of catecholamines from synaptic vesicles to the cytosol, and induction of reverse transport of transmitter through plasma membrane uptake carriers--and on additional drug effects that affect extracellular catecholamine levels, including uptake inhibition, effects on exocytosis, neurotransmitter synthesis, and metabolism.", "15549053": "Cocaine acts as a reinforcer through its pharmacological effects on brain monoaminergic systems, which, through repeated pairings with environmental stimuli, lead to the development of conditioned effects of the drug. Both the pharmacological and conditioned aspects of cocaine are implicated in several facets of acquisition and maintenance of addiction, including drug craving. Here, we compare the effects of contingent (response dependent) and noncontingent (response independent) cocaine on rapid dopaminergic signaling in the core of the nucleus accumbens. Dopamine was monitored using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. Noncontingent cocaine administered to both naive and animals with a history of self-administration resulted in a profound increase in the frequency of transient dopamine release events that are not time-locked to any specific environmental stimuli. Pharmacological effects were detectable approximately 40 s after cocaine administration. In contrast, when animals where allowed to self-administer cocaine on an FR-1 schedule, dopamine transients (69+/-12 nM) were consistently observed time-locked to each reinforced response (peaking approximately 1.5 s after response completion). Importantly, no pharmacological effect of cocaine was observed within the 10 s following noncontingent cocaine administration, indicating that dopamine signals time-locked to the reinforced response are a result of the pairing of the operant behavior, the drug-associated cues, and cocaine. These data demonstrate that this pharmacological action of cocaine occurs for an extended period following either contingent or noncontingent administration, but is distinct from those dopamine transients that are time-locked to each lever-press in self-administering animals.", "14737224": "The voltammetric responses of carbon-fiber microelectrodes with a 1.0 V and a 1.4 V anodic limit were compared in this study. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was used to characterize the response to dopamine and several other neurochemicals. An increase in the adsorption properties of the carbon fiber leads to an increase in sensitivity of 9 fold in vivo. However the temporal response of the sensor is slower with the more positive anodic limit. Increased electron transfer kinetics  also causes a decrease in the relative sensitivity for dopamine vs. other neurochemicals, and a change in their cyclic voltammograms. Stimulated release in the caudate-putamen was pharmacologically characterized in vivo using Ro-04-1284  and pargyline, and was consistent with that expected for dopamine.", "9482784": "Amphetamine (AMPH) inhibits uptake and causes release of dopamine (DA) from presynaptic terminals. AMPH can act on both vesicular storage of DA and directly  on the dopamine transporter (DAT). To assess the relative importance of these two processes, we have examined the releasing actions of AMPH in mice with a genetic  deletion of the DAT. The sequence of actions of AMPH has been determined by following the real time changes of DA in the extracellular fluid of intact tissue with fast scan cyclic voltammetry. In striatal slices from wild-type mice, AMPH causes a gradual (approximately 30 min) increase in extracellular DA, with a concomitant disappearance of the pool of DA available for depolarization-evoked release. Conversely, in slices from mice lacking the DAT, although a similar disappearance of electrically stimulated DA release occurs, extracellular DA does not increase. Similarly, microdialysis measurements of DA after AMPH in freely moving animals show no change in mice lacking the DAT, whereas it increases 10-fold in wild-type mice. In contrast, redistribution of DA from vesicles to the cytoplasm by the use of a reserpine-like compound, Ro4-1284, does not increase extracellular DA in slices from wild-type animals; however, subsequent addition of AMPH induces rapid (<5 min) release of DA. Thus, the DAT is required for the releasing action, but not the vesicle-depleting action, of AMPH on DA neurons, and the latter represents the rate-limiting step in the effects of AMPH. Furthermore, these findings suggest that in the absence of pharmacological manipulation, such as the use of amphetamine, endogenous cytoplasmic DA normally  does not reach sufficient concentrations to reverse the DAT.", "2899326": "The effect of various drugs on the extracellular concentration of dopamine in two terminal dopaminergic areas, the nucleus accumbens septi (a limbic area) and the  dorsal caudate nucleus (a subcortical motor area), was studied in freely moving rats by using brain dialysis. Drugs abused by humans (e.g., opiates, ethanol, nicotine, amphetamine, and cocaine) increased extracellular dopamine concentrations in both areas, but especially in the accumbens, and elicited hypermotility at low doses. On the other hand, drugs with aversive properties (e.g., agonists of kappa opioid receptors, U-50,488, tifluadom, and bremazocine)  reduced dopamine release in the accumbens and in the caudate and elicited hypomotility. Haloperidol, a neuroleptic drug, increased extracellular dopamine concentrations, but this effect was not preferential for the accumbens and was associated with hypomotility and sedation. Drugs not abused by humans [e.g., imipramine (an antidepressant), atropine (an antimuscarinic drug), and diphenhydramine (an antihistamine)] failed to modify synaptic dopamine concentrations. These results provide biochemical evidence for the hypothesis that stimulation of dopamine transmission in the limbic system might be a fundamental property of drugs that are abused.", "24858182": "The striatum is critical for reward-guided and habitual behavior. Anatomical and  interference studies suggest a functional heterogeneity within striatum. Medial regions, such as nucleus accumbens core and dorsal medial striatum play roles in  goal-directed behavior, while dorsal lateral striatum is critical for control of  habitual action. Subdivisions of striatum are topographically connected with different cortical and subcortical structures forming channels that carry information related to limbic, associative, and sensorimotor functions. Here, we  describe data showing that as one progresses from ventral-medial to dorsal-lateral striatum, there is a shift from more prominent value encoding to activity more closely related to associative and motor aspects of decision-making. In addition, we will describe data suggesting that striatal circuits work in parallel to control behavior and that regions within striatum can compensate for each other when functions are disrupted.", "24143880": "BACKGROUND: To make appropriate decisions, organisms must evaluate the risks and  benefits of action selection. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been shown to be critical for this processing and is necessary for appropriate risk-based decision-making behavior. However, it is not clear how NAc neurons encode this information to promote appropriate behavioral responding. METHODS: Here, rats (n = 17) were trained to perform a risky decision-making task in which discrete visual cues predicted the availability to respond for a smaller certain (safer) or larger uncertain (riskier) reward. Electrophysiological recordings were made in the NAc core and shell to evaluate neural activity during task performance. RESULTS: At test, animals exhibited individual differences in risk-taking behavior; some displayed a preference for the risky option, some the safe option, and some did not have a preference. Electrophysiological analysis indicated that  NAc neurons differentially encoded information related to risk versus safe outcomes. Further, during free choice trials, neural activity during reward-predictive cues reflected individual behavioral preferences. In addition,  neural encoding of reward outcomes was correlated with risk-taking behavior, with safe-preferring and risk-preferring rats showing differential activity in the NAc core and shell during reward omissions. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previously demonstrated alterations in prospective reward value with effort and delay, NAc neurons encode information during reward-predictive cues and outcomes in a risk task that tracked the rats' preferred responses. This processing appears to contribute to subjective encoding of anticipated outcomes and thus may function to bias future risk-based decisions.", "23136417": "Although fear directs adaptive behavioral responses, how aversive cues recruit motivational neural circuitry is poorly understood. Specifically, while it is known that dopamine (DA) transmission within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is imperative for mediating appetitive motivated behaviors, its role in aversive behavior is controversial. It has been proposed that divergent phasic DA transmission following aversive events may correspond to segregated mesolimbic dopamine pathways; however, this prediction has never been tested. Here, we used  fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to examine real-time DA transmission within NAc core and shell projection systems in response to a fear-evoking cue. In male Sprague Dawley rats, we first demonstrate that a fear cue results in decreased DA transmission within the NAc core, but increased transmission within the NAc shell. We examined whether these changes in DA transmission could be attributed to modulation of phasic transmission evoked by cue presentation. We found that cue presentation decreased the probability of phasic DA release in the core, while the same cue enhanced the amplitude of release events in the NAc shell. We  further characterized the relationship between freezing and both changes in DA as well as local pH. Although we found that both analytes were significantly correlated with freezing in the NAc across the session, changes in DA were not strictly associated with freezing while basic pH shifts in the core more consistently followed behavioral expression. Together, these results provide the  first real-time neurochemical evidence that aversive cues differentially modulate distinct DA projection systems.", "21849539": "Tests of Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) demonstrate that reward-predictive stimuli can exert a powerful motivational influence on the performance of instrumental actions. Recent evidence suggests that predictive stimuli produce this effect through either the general arousal (general PIT) or the specific predictions (outcome-specific PIT) produced by their association with reward. In  two experiments, we examined the effects of pretraining lesions (Experiment 1) or muscimol-induced inactivation (Experiment 2) of either the core or shell regions  of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) on these forms of PIT. Rats received Pavlovian training in which three auditory stimuli each predicted the delivery of a distinct food outcome. Separately, the rats were trained to perform two instrumental actions, each of which earned one of the outcomes used in Pavlovian  conditioning. Finally, the effects of the three stimuli on performance of the two actions were assessed in extinction. Here we report evidence of a double dissociation between general and outcome-specific PIT at the level of the accumbens. Shell lesions eliminated outcome-specific PIT but spared general PIT,  whereas lesions of the core abolished general PIT but spared outcome-specific PIT. Importantly, the infusion of muscimol into core or shell made immediately before the PIT tests produced a similar pattern of results. These results suggest that whereas the NAC core mediates the general excitatory effects of reward-related cues, the NAC shell mediates the effect of outcome-specific reward predictions on instrumental performance, and thereby serve to clarify reported discrepancies regarding the role of the NAC core and shell in PIT.", "19159648": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is important for the ability of motivationally significant stimuli to guide behavior. To further delineate its role in appetitive Pavlovian conditioning, we tested the hypothesis that the NAc contributes to memory consolidation and expression for a goal-tracking version of Pavlovian conditioned approach (PCA) in rats. We found that neither post-training reversible inactivation with the GABA receptor agonists muscimol and baclofen nor inhibition of protein synthesis with anisomycin (ANI) in either the core or shell regions of the NAc had an effect on approach to a reward port in response to a reward-predictive cue (conditioned stimulus, CS+). In contrast, pre-test reversible inactivation of both the core and shell decreased conditioned responding during the CS+. Unlike inactivation of the core, however, reversible inactivation of the shell also produced an increase in responding during the CS-  and the inter-trial interval. This suggests that the NAc is not involved in the consolidation of goal-tracking PCA, but that once the memory is formed, the core  is required for expression of the CS-unconditioned stimulus (US) association and  the shell is required to inhibit conditioned approach behavior at times when the  CS+ is not presented.", "18255035": "A neuroanatomical principle of striatal organization has been established through which ventral domains, including the nucleus accumbens, exert control over dorsal striatal processes mediated by so-called \"spiraling,\" striato-nigro-striatal, circuitry. We have investigated the functional significance of this circuitry in  the control over a cocaine-seeking habit by using an intrastriatal disconnection  procedure that combined a selective, unilateral lesion of the nucleus accumbens core and infusion of a dopamine receptor antagonist into the contralateral dorsolateral striatum, thereby disrupting striato-midbrain-striatal serial connectivity bilaterally. We show that this disconnection selectively decreased drug-seeking behavior in rats extensively trained under a second-order schedule of cocaine reinforcement. These data thereby define the importance of interactions between ventral and dorsal domains of the striatum, mediated by dopaminergic transmission, in the neural mechanisms underlying the development and performance of cocaine-seeking habits that are a key characteristic of drug addiction.", "12765613": "A growing body of evidence implicates the ventral striatum in using information acquired through associative learning. The present study examined the activity of ventral striatal neurons in awake, behaving rats during go/no-go odor discrimination learning and reversal. Many neurons fired selectively to odor cues predictive of either appetitive (sucrose) or aversive (quinine) outcomes. Few neurons were selective when first exposed to the odors, but many acquired this differential activity as rats learned the significance of the cues. A substantial proportion of these neurons encoded the cues' learned motivational significance,  and these neurons tended to reverse their firing selectivity after reversal of odor-outcome contingencies. Other neurons that became selectively activated during learning did not reverse, but instead appeared to encode specific combinations of cues and associated motor responses. The results support a role for ventral striatum in using the learned significance, both appetitive and aversive, of predictive cues to guide behavior.", "12611937": "In behavioral science, it is well known that humans and nonhuman animals are highly sensitive to differences in reward magnitude when choosing an outcome from a set of alternatives. We know that a realm of behavioral reactions is altered when animals begin to expect different levels of reward outcome. Our present aim  was to investigate how the expectation for different magnitudes of reward influences behavior-related neurophysiology in the anterior striatum. In a spatial delayed response task, different instruction pictures are presented to the monkey. Each image represents a different magnitude of juice. By reaching to  the spatial location where an instruction picture was presented, animals could receive the particular liquid amount designated by the stimulus. Reliable preferences in reward choice trials and differences in anticipatory licks, performance errors, and reaction times indicated that animals differentially expected the various reward amounts predicted by the instruction cues. A total of 374 of 2,000 neurons in the anterior parts of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and ventral striatum showed five forms of task-related activation during the preparation or execution of movement and activations preceding or following the liquid drop delivery. Approximately one-half of these striatal neurons showed differing response levels dependent on the magnitude of liquid to be received. Results of a linear regression analysis showed that reward magnitude and single cell discharge rate were related in a subset of neurons by a monotonic positive or negative relationship. Overall, these data support the idea that the striatum  utilizes expectancies that contain precise information concerning the predicted,  forthcoming level of reward in directing general behavioral reactions.", "11403692": "Pavlovian conditioned cues exert a powerful influence on instrumental actions directed towards a common reward, this is known as Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT). The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) has been hypothesized to function as an interface between limbic cortical structures required for associative conditioning, like the amygdala, and response mechanisms through which instrumental behaviour can be selected and performed. Here we have used selective excitotoxic lesions to investigate the involvement of subnuclei of the amygdala as well as the core and shell regions of the nucleus accumbens on PIT in rats. Within the amygdala, selective lesions of the central nucleus (CeN), but not of the basolateral nucleus (BLA), abolished the PIT effect. In addition, selective lesions of the NAcc core, but not the NAcc shell, also abolished PIT. None of the lesions impaired the acquisition of Pavlovian food cup approaches or instrumental responding itself. These data demonstrate that the CeN and NAcc core are central  components of the neural system mediating the impact of Pavlovian cues on instrumental responding. We suggest that this effect may depend upon the regulation of the dopaminergic innervation of the NAcc core by projections from the CeN to the ventral tegmental area.", "10066290": "Dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) has been associated with both the rewarding and locomotor-stimulant effects of abused drugs. The functions of the NAcc core and shell were investigated in mediating amphetamine-potentiated conditioned reinforcement and locomotion. Rats were initially trained to associate a neutral stimulus (Pavlovian CS) with food reinforcement (US). After excitotoxic lesions that selectively destroyed either the NAcc core or shell, animals underwent additional CS-US training sessions and then were tested for the acquisition of a new instrumental response that produced the CS acting as a conditioned reinforcer (CR). Animals were infused intra-NAcc with D-amphetamine (0, 1, 3, 10, or 20 microg) before each session. Shell lesions affected neither Pavlovian nor instrumental conditioning but completely abolished the potentiative effect of intra-NAcc amphetamine on responding with CR. Core-lesioned animals were impaired during the Pavlovian retraining sessions but showed no deficit in the acquisition of responding with CR. However, the selectivity in stimulant-induced potentiation of the CR lever was reduced, as intra-NAcc amphetamine infusions dose-dependently increased responding on both the CR lever  and a nonreinforced (control) lever. Shell lesions produced hypoactivity and attenuated amphetamine-induced activity. In contrast, core lesions resulted in hyperactivity and enhanced the locomotor-stimulating effect of amphetamine. These results indicate a functional dissociation of subregions of the NAcc; the shell is a critical site for stimulant effects underlying the enhancement of responding with CR and locomotion after intra-NAcc injections of amphetamine, whereas the core is implicated in mechanisms underlying the expression of CS-US associations.", "29195840": "Within the adult female, estrogen signaling is well-described as an integral component of the physiologically significant hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. In rodents, the timing of ovulation is intrinsically entwined with the display of sexual receptivity. For decades, the importance of estradiol activating intracellular estrogen receptors within the hypothalamus and midbrain/spinal cord lordosis circuits has been appreciated. These signaling pathways primarily account for the ability of the female to reproduce. Yet, often overlooked is that the desire to reproduce is also tightly regulated by estrogen receptor signaling. This lack of emphasis can be attributed to an absence of nuclear estrogen receptors in brain regions associated with reward, such as the nucleus accumbens, which are associated with motivated behaviors. This review outlines how membrane-localized estrogen receptors affect metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling within the rodent nucleus accumbens. In addition, we discuss how, as estrogens drive increased motivation for reproduction, they also produce the untoward side effect of heightening female vulnerability to drug addiction.", "28794196": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has often been described as a \"limbic-motor interface,\" implying that the NAc integrates the value of expected rewards with the motor planning required to obtain them. However, there is little direct evidence that the signaling of individual NAc neurons combines information about  predicted reward and behavioral response. We report that cue-evoked neural responses in the NAc form a likely physiological substrate for its limbic-motor integration function. Across task contexts, individual NAc neurons in behaving rats robustly encode the reward-predictive qualities of a cue, as well as the probability of behavioral response to the cue, as coexisting components of the neural signal. In addition, cue-evoked activity encodes spatial and locomotor aspects of the behavioral response, including proximity to a reward-associated target and the latency and speed of approach to the target. Notably, there are important limits to the ability of NAc neurons to integrate motivational information into behavior: in particular, updating of predicted reward value appears to occur on a relatively long timescale, since NAc neurons fail to discriminate between cues with reward associations that change frequently. Overall, these findings suggest that NAc cue-evoked signals, including inhibition of firing (as noted here for the first time), provide a mechanism for linking reward prediction and other motivationally relevant factors, such as spatial proximity, to the probability and vigor of a reward-seeking behavioral response.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to link expected rewards and action planning, but evidence for this idea remains sparse. We show that, across contexts, both excitatory and inhibitory cue-evoked activity in the  NAc jointly encode reward prediction and probability of behavioral responding to  the cue, as well as spatial and locomotor properties of the response. Interestingly, although spatial information in the NAc is updated quickly, fine-grained updating of reward value occurs over a longer timescale.", "26164802": "BACKGROUND: Repeated exposure to cocaine or social stress leads to lasting structural and functional synaptic alterations in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of  nucleus accumbens (NAc). Although cocaine-induced and stress-induced structural changes in dendritic spines have been well documented, few studies have investigated functional consequences of cocaine and stress at the level of single spines. METHODS: We exposed mice to chronic cocaine or chronic social defeat stress and used two-photon laser scanning microscopy with glutamate photo-uncaging and whole-cell recording to examine synaptic strength at individual spines on two distinct types of NAc MSNs in acute slices after 24 hours of cocaine withdrawal and after chronic social defeat stress. RESULTS: In animals treated with cocaine, average synaptic strength was reduced specifically at large mushroom spines of MSNs expressing dopamine receptor type 1 (D1-MSNs). In contrast, cocaine promoted a rightward shift in the distribution of synaptic weights toward larger synaptic responses in MSNs expressing dopamine receptor type 2 (D2-MSNs). After chronic social defeat stress, resilient animals  displayed an upregulation of synaptic strength at large mushroom spines of D1-MSNs and a concomitant downregulation in D2-MSNs. Although susceptible mice did not exhibit a significant overall change in synaptic strength on D1-MSNs or D2-MSNs, we observed a slight leftward shift in cumulative distribution of large  synaptic responses in both cell types. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first functional cell type-specific and spine type-specific comparison of synaptic strength at a single spine level between cocaine-induced and stress-induced neuroadaptations and demonstrates that psychoactive drugs and stress trigger divergent changes in synaptic function in NAc.", "26116518": "Addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by the loss of control over drug intake, high motivation to obtain the drug, and a persistent craving for the drug. Accumulating evidence implicates cellular and molecular alterations within cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuitry in the development and persistence of this disease. The striatum is a heterogeneous structure that sits  at the interface of this circuit, receiving input from a variety of brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, ventral tegmental area) to guide behavioral output, including motor planning, decision-making, motivation and reward. However, the vast interconnectivity of this circuit has made it difficult to isolate how individual projections and cellular subtypes within this circuit modulate each of the facets of addiction. Here, we review the use of new technologies, including optogenetics and DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs), in unraveling the role of the striatum in addiction. In particular, we focus on the role of striatal cell populations (i.e., direct and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons) and striatal dopaminergic and glutamatergic afferents in addiction-related plasticity and behaviors.", "25720819": "There is increasing interest among functional neurosurgeons in the potential for  novel therapies to impact upon diseases beyond movement disorders and pain. A target of increasing interest is the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which has long been studied as a key brain region mediating a variety of behaviors, including reward  and satisfaction. As such, focal modulation of the biology of the NAc with deep brain stimulation or novel biological therapies such as gene therapy or cell transplantation could have a major impact upon disorders such as depression and drug addiction. In order to both develop appropriate therapies and then deliver them in an effective fashion, a thorough understanding of the biology, physiology, and anatomy of the NAc is critical. Here, we review the existing literature regarding several areas critical to the development of new therapies,  including the known pharmacology, physiology, and connectivity of the NAc, as well as evidence supporting the potential for various NAc surgical therapies in animal models. We then review the relevant anatomy of the NAc, with particular attention to the surgical anatomy, imaging, and targeting necessary to facilitate a proper localization and delivery of new agents to this region. The NAc is a fascinating and potentially rich target for stereotactic neurosurgical intervention, and analysis of existing information regarding all aspects of this  structure should help potentiate therapeutic advances and reduce complications from future studies of neurosurgical intervention in this region for a variety of disorders. \u00a9 2015 S.

Most new technology regarding this tissue has involved  the chamber used when performing electrophysiological experiments. Alternatively  we instead focus on the creation of a simple, versatile aerator designed to allow maintenance and manipulation of acute brain slices and potentially other tissue in a multi-well cell culture plate. NEW METHOD: Here we present an easily manufactured aerator designed to fit into a 24-well cell culture plate. It features a nylon mesh and a single microhole to enable gas delivery without compromising tissue stability. The aerator is designed to be individually controlled, allowing both high throughput and single  well experiments. RESULTS: The aerator was validated by testing material leach, dissolved oxygen delivery, brain slice viability and neuronal electrophysiology. Example experiments are also presented, including a test of whether \u03b21-adrenergic receptor activation regulates gene expression in ex vivo dorsal striatum using qPCR. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Key differences include enhanced control over gas delivery to individual wells containing brain slices, decreased necessary volume, a sample restraint to reduce movement artifacts, the potential to be sterilized, the avoidance of materials that absorb water and small biological molecules, minimal production costs, and increased experimental throughput.

Sex differences in the ability of estradiol to influence cocaine self-administration in adult rats have been hypothesized to depend upon pubertal estradiol exposure. The current study investigated whether the presence of gonadal hormones during puberty affected cocaine self-administration behavior and its sensitivity to adult estradiol treatment in  male and female Sprague-Dawley rats. Subjects were gonadectomized or SHAM-operated at postnatal day (PD) 22, and received either OIL or estradiol benzoate (EB) during the approximate time of puberty (PD27 to PD37). Adult rats were subsequently treated with either EB or OIL 30 min before cocaine self-administration (0.3 mg/kg/inf) in order to examine the effects of pubertal manipulations on the estradiol sensitivity of acquisition on a fixed ratio (FR) 1 schedule, total intake on a FR5 schedule and motivation on a progressive ratio schedule. Adult EB treatment only affected cocaine self-administration in females, which is consistent with previous research. Adult EB treatment enhanced  acquisition in all females irrespective of puberty manipulations. All females, except those treated with EB during puberty, displayed increased cocaine intake following adult EB treatment. Adult EB treatment only enhanced motivation in females that were intact during puberty, whereas those treated with EB during puberty showed reduced motivation. Therefore, the sensitivities of different self-administration behaviors to adult estradiol treatment are organized independently in females, with pubertal estradiol exerting a greater influence over motivational processes, and negligible effects on learning/acquisition.", "23469183": "D1 and D2 receptor expressing striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are ascribed to striatonigral (\"direct\") and striatopallidal (\"indirect\") pathways, respectively, that are believed to function antagonistically in motor control. Glutamatergic synaptic transmission onto the two types is differentially affected by Dopamine (DA), however, less is known about the effects on MSN intrinsic electrical properties. Using patch clamp recordings, we comprehensively characterized the two pathways in rats and mice, and investigated their DA modulation. We identified the direct pathway by retrograde labeling in rats, and  in mice we used transgenic animals in which EGFP is expressed in D1 MSNs. MSNs were subjected to a series of current injections to pinpoint differences between  the populations, and in mice also following bath application of DA. In both animal models, most electrical properties were similar, however, membrane excitability as measured by step and ramp current injections consistently differed, with direct pathway MSNs being less excitable than their counterparts.  DA had opposite effects on excitability of D1 and D2 MSNs, counteracting the initial differences. Pronounced changes in AP shape were seen in D2 MSNs. In direct pathway MSNs, excitability increased across experimental conditions and parameters, and also when applying DA or the D1 agonist SKF-81297 in presence of  blockers of cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic receptors. Thus, DA induced changes in excitability were D1 R mediated and intrinsic to direct pathway MSNs,  and not a secondary network effect of altered synaptic transmission. DAergic modulation of intrinsic properties therefore acts in a synergistic manner with previously reported effects of DA on afferent synaptic transmission and dendritic processing, supporting the antagonistic model for direct vs. indirect striatal pathway function.", "22410393": "Opioids are effective analgesic agents but serious adverse effects such as tolerance and withdrawal contribute to opioid dependence and limit their use. Opioid withdrawal involves numerous brain regions and includes suppression of dopamine release and activation of neurons in the ventral striatum. By contrast,  acute opioids increase dopamine release. Like withdrawal, acute opioids also activate neurons in the ventral striatum, suggesting that different populations of ventral striatal neurons may be activated by withdrawal and acute opioid actions. Here, immunofluorescence for the activity-related immediate-early gene,  c-Fos, was examined in transgenic reporter mouse lines by confocal microscopy to  study the specific populations of ventral striatal neurons activated by morphine  withdrawal and acute morphine. After chronic morphine, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal strongly increased expression of c-Fos immunoreactivity, predominantly in D2-receptor (D2R) medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell regions. By contrast, a single injection of morphine exclusively activated c-Fos immunoreactivity in D1-receptor expressing (D1R) MSNs of the core and shell of the NAc. These results reveal a striking segregation of  neuronal responses occurring in the two populations of MSNs of the NAc in response to morphine withdrawal and acute morphine.", "21209197": "Bacteria artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice expressing the reporter protein enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor promoters (Drd1-EGFP and Drd2-EGFP) have been widely used to study striatal function and have contributed to our understanding of the physiological and pathological functions of the basal ganglia. These tools were produced and promptly made available to address questions in a cell-specific manner that has transformed the way we frame hypotheses in neuroscience. However, these mice have not been fully characterized until now. We found that Drd2-EGFP mice display an \u223c40% increase in membrane expression of the dopamine D2 receptor  (D2R) and a twofold increase in D2R mRNA levels in the striatum when compared with wild-type and Drd1-EGFP mice. D2R overexpression was accompanied by behavioral hypersensitivity to D2R-like agonists, as well as enhanced electrophysiological responses to D2R activation in midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Dopamine (DA) transients evoked by stimulation in the nucleus accumbens  showed slower clearance in Drd2-EGFP mice, and cocaine actions on DA clearance were impaired in these mice. Thus, it was not surprising to find that Drd2-EGFP mice were hyperactive when exposed to a novel environment and locomotion was suppressed by acute cocaine administration. All together, this study demonstrates that Drd2-EGFP mice overexpress D2R and have altered dopaminergic signaling that  fundamentally differentiates them from wild-type and Drd1-EGFP mice.", "20620164": "Female mammals have long been neglected in biomedical research. The NIH mandated  enrollment of women in human clinical trials in 1993, but no similar initiatives  exist to foster research on female animals. We reviewed sex bias in research on mammals in 10 biological fields for 2009 and their historical precedents. Male bias was evident in 8 disciplines and most prominent in neuroscience, with single-sex studies of male animals outnumbering those of females 5.5 to 1. In the past half-century, male bias in non-human studies has increased while declining in human studies. Studies of both sexes frequently fail to analyze results by sex. Underrepresentation of females in animal models of disease is also commonplace, and our understanding of female biology is compromised by these deficiencies. The majority of articles in several journals are conducted on rats  and mice to the exclusion of other useful animal models. The belief that non-human female mammals are intrinsically more variable than males and too troublesome for routine inclusion in research protocols is without foundation. We recommend that when only one sex is studied, this should be indicated in article  titles, and that funding agencies favor proposals that investigate both sexes and analyze data by sex.", "19818789": "Increasing evidence indicates the presence of sex differences in many aspects of  drug abuse. Most studies reveal that females exceed males during the initiation,  escalation, extinction, and reinstatement (relapse) of drug-seeking behavior, but males are more sensitive than females to the aversive effects of drugs such as drug withdrawal. Findings from human and animal research indicate that circulating levels of ovarian steroid hormones account for these sex differences. Estrogen (E) facilitates drug-seeking behavior, while progesterone (P) and its metabolite, allopregnanalone (ALLO), counteract the effects of E and reduce drug  seeking. Estrogen and P influence other behaviors that are affiliated with drug abuse such as drug-induced locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference. The enhanced vulnerability to drug seeking in females vs. males is also additive with the other risk factors for drug abuse (e.g., adolescence, sweet preference, novelty reactivity, and impulsivity). Finally, treatment studies using behavioral or pharmacological interventions, including P and ALLO,  also indicate that females show greater treatment effectiveness during several phases of the addiction process. The neurobiological basis of sex differences in  drug abuse appears to be genetic and involves the influence of ovarian hormones and their metabolites, the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, dopamine (DA), and gamma-hydroxy-butyric acid (GABA). Overall, sex and hormonal status along with other biological risk factors account for a continuum of addiction-prone and -resistant animal models that are valuable for studying drug  abuse prevention and treatment strategies.", "19765834": "Understanding how molecular signaling pathways participate in behavioral responses requires determining precisely in which neuronal populations they are activated. The recent development of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice expressing a variety of reporters, epitope tagged-proteins or Cre recombinase driven by specific promoters, is a significant step forward in this direction. These mice help overcome the limitations of traditional approaches that examine an average of signaling events occurring in mixed populations of cells. Here, we review how recent studies using such tools have revisited the regulation of striatal signaling pathways, demonstrating the striking segregation between neurons expressing dopamine D1 and D2 receptors and significantly extending our overall knowledge of striatal neurons. Thus, BAC transgenic mice are changing the way to conceive experiments and provide an opportunity to fill the gaps between molecular and systems neurosciences.", "18279319": "The electrophysiological properties of distinct subpopulations of striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSSNs) were compared using enhanced green fluorescent protein as a reporter gene for identification of neurons expressing dopamine D1 and D2 receptor subtypes in mice. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in slices revealed that passive membrane properties were similar in D1 and D2 cells. All MSSNs displayed hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials but the threshold for  firing action potentials was lower in D2 than in D1 neurons. In voltage clamp, the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents was higher in D2 than in D1 cells and large-amplitude inward currents (> 100 pA) were observed only in D2 cells. After tetrodotoxin this difference was reduced, suggesting that sodium conductances contribute to the increased frequencies in D2 cells. After pharmacological blockade of GABA(A) receptors, a subset of D2 cells also displayed large spontaneous membrane depolarizations and complex responses to stimulation of the corticostriatal pathway. To further characterize ionotropic glutamate receptor function, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) was applied onto dissociated MSSNs. Application of AMPA alone or in the presence of cyclothiazide (an AMPA receptor desensitization blocker) evoked larger currents in D1 than in D2 cells. Together, these data demonstrate significant differences in electrophysiological properties of subpopulations of MSSNs defined by selective expression of D1 and D2 receptors. D2 cells display increased excitability and reflect ongoing cortical activity more faithfully than D1 cells, an effect that is independent of postsynaptic AMPA receptors and probably results from stronger synaptic coupling. This could help to explain the  increased vulnerability of D2 MSSNs in neurodegenerative disorders.", "16983543": "BACKGROUND: The nucleus accumbens is the ventral extent of the striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia. Recent hypotheses propose that the accumbens  and its dopamine projection from the midbrain contribute to appetitive behaviors  required to obtain reward. However, the specific nature of this contribution is unclear. In contrast, significant advances have been made in understanding the role of the dorsal striatum in action selection and decision making. OBJECTIVE: In order to develop a hypothesis of the role of nucleus accumbens dopamine in action selection, the physiology and behavioral pharmacology of the nucleus accumbens are compared to those of the dorsal striatum. HYPOTHESES: Three hypotheses concerning the role of dopamine in these structures  are proposed: (1) that dopamine release in the dorsal striatum serves to facilitate the ability to respond appropriately to temporally predictable stimuli (that is, stimuli that are so predictable that animals engage in anticipatory behavior just prior to the stimulus); (2) that dopamine in the nucleus accumbens  facilitates the ability to respond to temporally unpredictable stimuli (which require interruption of ongoing behavior); and (3) that accumbens neurons participate in action selection in response to such stimuli by virtue of their direct (monosynaptic inhibitory) and indirect (polysynaptic excitatory) projections to basal ganglia output nuclei.", "15660666": "Sexual experience, like repeated drug use, produces long-term changes including sensitization in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum. To better understand  the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroadaptations following sexual experience, we employed a DNA microarray approach to identify genes differentially expressed between sexually experienced and sexually naive female hamsters within the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum. For 6 weeks, a stimulus male was placed in the home cage of one-half of the hormonally primed, ovariectomized female hamsters. On the seventh week, the two experimental groups  were subdivided, with one half paired with a stimulus male. In comparison with sexually naive animals, sexually experienced hamsters receiving a stimulus male on week 7 exhibited an increase in a large number of genes. Conversely, sexually  experienced female hamsters not receiving a stimulus male on week 7 exhibited a reduction in the expression of many genes. For directional changes and the categories of genes regulated by the experimental conditions, data were consistent across the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum. However, the specific genes exhibiting changes in expression were disparate. These experiments, among the first to profile genes regulated by female sexual behavior, will provide insight into the mechanisms by which both motivated behaviors and drugs of abuse induce long-term changes in the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine pathways.", "9712637": "Inwardly rectifying K+ (IRK) channels are critical for shaping cell excitability. Whole-cell patch-clamp and single-cell RT-PCR techniques were used to characterize the inwardly rectifying K+ currents found in projection neurons of the rat nucleus accumbens. Inwardly rectifying currents were highly selective for K+ and blocked by low millimolar concentrations of Cs+ or Ba2+. In a subset of neurons, the inwardly rectifying current appeared to inactivate at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. In an attempt to identify this subset, neurons were profiled using single-cell RT-PCR. Neurons expressing substance P mRNA exhibited noninactivating inward rectifier currents, whereas neurons expressing enkephalin  mRNA exhibited inactivating inward rectifier currents. The inactivation of the inward rectifier was correlated with the expression of IRK1 mRNA. These results demonstrate a clear physiological difference in the properties of medium spiny neurons and suggest that this difference could influence active state transitions driven by cortical and hippocampal excitatory input.", "8201411": "1. Neostriatal spiny projection neurons display a prominent slowly depolarizing (ramp) potential and long latency to spike discharge in response to intracellular current pulses. The contribution of a slowly inactivating A-current (IAs) to this delayed excitation was investigated in a neostriatal slice preparation using current pulse protocols incorporating information based on the known voltage dependence, kinetics, and pharmacological properties of IAs. 2. Depolarizing intracellular current pulses evoked a slowly developing ramp potential that could last for seconds without reaching steady state and continued until either the pulse was terminated or spike threshold was reached. The slope of the ramp potential was dependent on the level of depolarization achieved by the membrane,  and the apparent activation threshold for this ramp depolarization was approximately -65 mV. 3. Application of low concentrations of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 30-100 microM) or dendrotoxin (DTX, 30 nM), which are known to selectively block IAs, reduced both the slope of the ramp potential and the latency to first  spike discharge. As has been described previously, blockade of inward Na+ and Ca2+ currents with tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 microM) and cadmium (400 microM) also reduced the slope of the ramp depolarization. 4. A conditioning-test pulse protocol was used to examine the voltage dependence of inactivation of the ramp potential and long first spike latency. In the absence of a conditioning pulse, the test pulse evoked a slowly rising ramp potential and a spike with a long latency to discharge. A conditioning depolarization to approximately -60 mV decreased the slope of the ramp potential and the latency to first spike discharge evoked by the test pulse. A conditioning hyperpolarization to potentials below -100 mV, increased first spike latency. Application of a low concentration of 4-AP (100 microM) abolished the influence of prior membrane potential on the slope of the ramp depolarization and the latency to first spike  discharge. 5. The kinetics of recovery from inactivation of the 4-AP-sensitive current were studied in the presence of TTX and cadmium by depolarizing cells to  approximately -50 mV and then stepping to approximately -90 mV for increasing periods of time (0.5-5.0 s) before delivering a test pulse. The amplitude of the  test pulse response decreased as a function of the hyperpolarizing step duration.

This review focuses on the effects of sex steroids on dopaminergic activity in extrahypothalamic brain areas. Among sex steroids, estrogens have been most extensively investigated, and many studies report that estrogens affect behaviors mediated by the basal ganglia, such as in  humans suffering from extrapyramidal disorders. Epidemiological and clinical evidence also suggests an influence of estrogens on the vulnerability threshold for schizophrenia and sex differences in the clinical expression of this disease. Clinical observations point to a role of androgenic hormones in Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. In normal humans, sex steroids were also shown to influence  motor and cognitive performance. Biochemical and behavioral studies in animals have also shown the effect of sex steroids on dopaminergic activity in the basal  ganglia; however, both activating and inhibiting effects have been reported. This may partly be explained by effects of the dose, duration of treatment, interval between steroid administration and testing the behavior measured, and the part of the basal ganglia from which the behavior is elicited. In view of the numerous variables that influence net dopaminergic response to steroids, focus will be on  the literature using similar experimental conditions to assess the effect of in vivo chronic steroid treatment, acute short-term steroid treatment and the estrous cycle as well as in vitro effects of steroids on dopamine receptors. These experimental paradigms point to two general mechanisms of action of steroids: a rapid short-term non-genomic membrane effect and a slower long-term possibly genomic effect of steroids on dopamine systems. Combining dopaminergic drugs with sex steroids could improve efficacy or reduce side effects associated  with these drugs. Examples of such combined treatments in rats and monkeys are presented for delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cocaine, neuroleptics, apomorphine and L-DOPA. A better understanding of steroid-dopamine interactions and the possible isolation of conditions to have only pro or anti dopaminergic activity could then be used to develop combined therapies or to optimize drug treatments that would take into account the patient's sex and endocrine status.", "23575859": "Cocaine-induced neuroplasticity mediated by histone acetylating and deacetylating enzymes may contribute to addiction-like behaviors. For example, overexpression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) 4 or 5 in the nucleus accumbens suppresses cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) acquisition in mice. HDAC4 and HDAC5 are known to interact with HDAC3, but the role of HDAC3 in cocaine-induced  behaviors has never been examined. In this study, we address the hypothesis that  HDAC3 is a negative regulator of cocaine-context-associated memory formation in mice. We examined the role of HDAC3 during the conditioning phase of CPP, when the mouse has the opportunity to form an associative memory between the cocaine-paired context and the subjective effects of cocaine. To address this hypothesis, Hdac3(flox/flox) and Hdac3(+/+) mice (generated from a C57BL/6 background) were infused into the nucleus accumbens with adeno-associated virus expressing Cre recombinase to create focal, homozygous Hdac3 deletions. Hdac3(flox/flox) mice exhibit significantly enhanced CPP acquisition, which is correlated with increased gene expression during the consolidation phase of acquisition. Increased gene expression of c-Fos and Nr4a2 is correlated with decreased HDAC3 occupancy and increased histone H4 lysine 8 acetylation at their  promoters. The results from this study demonstrate that HDAC3 negatively regulates cocaine-induced CPP acquisition.", "23525042": "Recent exome sequencing studies have implicated polymorphic Brg1-associated factor (BAF) complexes (mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes) in several human intellectual disabilities and cognitive disorders. However, it is currently unknown how mutations in BAF complexes result in impaired cognitive function. Postmitotic neurons express a neuron-specific assembly, nBAF, characterized by the neuron-specific subunit BAF53b. Mice harboring selective genetic manipulations of BAF53b have severe defects in long-term memory and long-lasting forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. We rescued memory impairments in BAF53b mutant mice by reintroducing BAF53b in the adult hippocampus, which suggests a role for BAF53b beyond neuronal development. The defects in BAF53b mutant mice appeared to derive from alterations in gene expression that produce abnormal postsynaptic components, such as spine structure and function, and ultimately lead to deficits in synaptic plasticity. Our results provide new insight into the role of dominant mutations in subunits of BAF complexes in human intellectual and cognitive disorders.", "19447090": "Changes in gene expression contribute to the long-lasting regulation of the brain's reward circuitry seen in drug addiction; however, the specific genes regulated and the transcriptional mechanisms underlying such regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with promoter microarray analysis to characterize genome-wide chromatin changes in the mouse nucleus accumbens, a crucial brain reward region, after repeated cocaine administration. Our findings reveal several interesting principles of gene regulation by cocaine and of the role of DeltaFosB and CREB, two prominent cocaine-induced transcription factors, in this brain region. The findings also provide comprehensive insight into the molecular pathways regulated by cocaine-including a new role for sirtuins (Sirt1 and Sirt2)-which are induced in  the nucleus accumbens by cocaine and, in turn, dramatically enhance the behavioral effects of the drug.", "17988634": "Previous work has identified alterations in histone acetylation in animal models  of drug addiction and depression. However, the mechanisms which integrate drugs and stress with changes in chromatin structure remain unclear. Here, we identify  the activity-dependent class II histone deacetylase, HDAC5, as a central integrator of these stimuli with changes in chromatin structure and gene expression. Chronic, but not acute, exposure to cocaine or stress decreases HDAC5 function in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major brain reward region, which allows for increased histone acetylation and transcription of HDAC5 target genes. This regulation is behaviorally important, as loss of HDAC5 causes hypersensitive responses to chronic, not acute, cocaine or stress. These findings suggest that proper balance of histone acetylation is a crucial factor in the saliency of a given stimulus and that disruption of this balance is involved in the transition  from an acute adaptive response to a chronic psychiatric illness.", "16242410": "Given that cocaine induces neuroadaptations through regulation of gene expression, we investigated whether chromatin remodeling at specific gene promoters may be a key mechanism. We show that cocaine induces specific histone modifications at different gene promoters in striatum, a major neural substrate for cocaine's behavioral effects. At the cFos promoter, H4 hyperacetylation is seen within 30 min of a single cocaine injection, whereas no histone modifications were seen with chronic cocaine, consistent with cocaine's ability to induce cFos acutely, but not chronically. In contrast, at the BDNF and Cdk5 promoters, genes that are induced by chronic, but not acute, cocaine, H3 hyperacetylation was observed with chronic cocaine only. DeltaFosB, a cocaine-induced transcription factor, appears to mediate this regulation of the Cdk5 gene. Furthermore, modulating histone deacetylase activity alters locomotor  and rewarding responses to cocaine. Thus, chromatin remodeling is an important regulatory mechanism underlying cocaine-induced neural and behavioral plasticity.", "16055761": "OBJECTIVE: A primary behavioral pathology in drug addiction is the overpowering motivational strength and decreased ability to control the desire to obtain drugs. In this review the authors explore how advances in neurobiology are approaching an understanding of the cellular and circuitry underpinnings of addiction, and they describe the novel pharmacotherapeutic targets emerging from  this understanding. METHOD: Findings from neuroimaging of addicts are integrated with cellular studies in animal models of drug seeking. RESULTS: While dopamine is critical for acute reward and initiation of addiction, end-stage addiction results primarily from cellular adaptations in anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal glutamatergic projections to the nucleus accumbens. Pathophysiological plasticity in excitatory transmission reduces the capacity of  the prefrontal cortex to initiate behaviors in response to biological rewards and to provide executive control over drug seeking. Simultaneously, the prefrontal cortex is hyperresponsive to stimuli predicting drug availability, resulting in supraphysiological glutamatergic drive in the nucleus accumbens, where excitatory synapses have a reduced capacity to regulate neurotransmission. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular adaptations in prefrontal glutamatergic innervation of the  accumbens promote the compulsive character of drug seeking in addicts by decreasing the value of natural rewards, diminishing cognitive control (choice),  and enhancing glutamatergic drive in response to drug-associated stimuli.", "11996312": "There is considerable evidence that the basolateral complex of the amygdala (ABL) is involved in learning about the motivational value of otherwise neutral stimuli. The authors examined the role in this function of the ABL and one of its major efferent structures. the nucleus accumbens. Male Long-Evans rats received either sham, ipsilaterally, or contralaterally placed unilateral lesions of the ABL and accumbens and were trained in an appetitive Pavlovian second-order conditioning task. Sham-lesioned and ipsilaterally lesioned rats acquired the task normally, but contralaterally lesioned rats, in which the ABL and accumbens  were functionally disconnected, failed to acquire second-order conditioned responses (although they did acquire second-order conditioned orienting responses). The results suggest that the ABL and accumbens are part of a system critical for processing information about learned motivational value.", "11328886": "Use of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify cDNA products reverse transcribed from mRNA is on the way to becoming a routine tool in molecular biology to study low abundance gene expression. Real-time PCR is easy to perform, provides the necessary accuracy and produces reliable as well as rapid quantification results. But accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. This study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. Therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. The  relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time PCR efficiencies  and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. This model needs no calibration curve. Control levels were included in the model to standardise each reaction run with respect to RNA integrity, sample loading and inter-PCR variations. High accuracy and reproducibility (<2.5% variation) were reached in LightCycler PCR using the established mathematical model.", "29754750": "Conditioned place preference (CPP) is a widely used model of addiction-related behavior whose underlying mechanisms are not understood. In this study, we used dual site silicon probe recordings in freely moving mice to examine interactions  between the hippocampus and nucleus accumbens in cocaine CPP. We found that CPP was associated with recruitment of D2-positive nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons to fire in the cocaine-paired location, and this recruitment was driven predominantly by selective strengthening of coupling with hippocampal place cells that encode the cocaine-paired location. These findings provide in\u00a0vivo evidence  suggesting that the synaptic potentiation in the accumbens caused by repeated cocaine administration preferentially affects inputs that were active at the time of drug exposure. This provides a potential physiological mechanism by which drug use becomes associated with specific environmental contexts.", "23810541": "The striatum integrates information from multiple brain regions to shape motor learning. The two major projection cell types in striatum target different downstream basal ganglia targets and have opposing effects on motivated behavior, yet differential innervation of these neuronal subtypes is not well understood. To examine whether input specificity provides a substrate for information segregation in these circuits, we used a monosynaptic rabies virus system to generate brain-wide maps of neurons that form synapses with direct- or indirect-pathway striatal projection neurons. We discovered that sensory cortical and limbic structures preferentially innervated the direct pathway, whereas motor cortex preferentially targeted the indirect pathway. Thalamostriatal input, dopaminergic input, as well as input from specific cortical layers, was similar onto both pathways. We also confirm synaptic innervation of striatal projection neurons by the raphe and pedunculopontine nuclei. Together, these findings provide a framework for guiding future studies of basal ganglia circuit function.", "23595733": "Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) within the nucleus accumbens shell (NAc) function to  gate and prioritize emotional/motivational arousals for behavioral output. The neuronal output of NAc MSNs is mainly determined by the integration of membrane excitability and excitatory/inhibitory synaptic inputs. Whereas cocaine-induced alterations at excitatory synapses and membrane excitability have been extensively examined, the overall functional output of NAc MSNs following cocaine exposure is still poorly defined because little is known about whether inhibitory synaptic input to these neurons is affected by cocaine. Here, our results demonstrate multidimensional alterations at inhibitory synapses in NAc neurons following cocaine self-administration in rats. Specifically, the amplitude of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) was decreased after 21 d withdrawal from 5 d cocaine self-administration. Upon re-exposure to cocaine after 21 d withdrawal, whereas the amplitude of mIPSCs remained downregulated, the frequency became significantly higher. Furthermore, the reversal potential of IPSCs, which was not significantly altered during withdrawal, became more hyperpolarized upon cocaine  re-exposure. Moreover, the relative weight of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to NAc MSNs was significantly decreased after 1 d cocaine withdrawal, increased after 21 d withdrawal, and returned to the basal level upon cocaine re-exposure after 21 d withdrawal. These results, together with previous results showing cocaine-induced adaptations at excitatory synapses and intrinsic membrane excitability of NAc MSNs, may provide a relatively thorough picture of the functional state of NAc MSNs following cocaine exposure.", "23267100": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulates motivated behavior by, in part, processing  excitatory synaptic projections from several brain regions. Among these regions,  the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basolateral amygdala, convey executive control and affective states, respectively. Whereas glutamatergic synaptic transmission within the NAc has been recognized as a primary cellular target for cocaine and other drugs of abuse to induce addiction-related pathophysiological motivational  states, the understanding has been thus far limited to drug-induced postsynaptic  alterations. It remains elusive whether exposure to cocaine or other drugs of abuse influences presynaptic functions of these excitatory projections, and if so, in which projection pathways. Using optogenetic methods combined with biophysical assays, we demonstrate that the presynaptic release probability (Pr)  of the PFC-to-NAc synapses was enhanced after short-term withdrawal (1 d) and long-term (45 d) withdrawal from either noncontingent (i.p. injection) or contingent (self-administration) exposure to cocaine. After long-term withdrawal  of contingent drug exposure, the Pr was higher compared with i.p. injected rats.  In contrast, within the basolateral amygdala afferents, presynaptic Pr was not significantly altered in any of these experimental conditions. Thus, cocaine-induced procedure- and pathway-specific presynaptic enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission in the NAc. These results, together with previous findings of cocaine-induced postsynaptic enhancement, suggest an increased PFC-to-NAc shell glutamatergic synaptic transmission after withdrawal from exposure to cocaine. This presynaptic alteration may interact with other cocaine-induced cellular adaptations to shift the functional output of NAc neurons, contributing to the addictive emotional and motivational state.", "21796121": "Severe behavioural deficits in psychiatric diseases such as autism and schizophrenia have been hypothesized to arise from elevations in the cellular balance of excitation and inhibition (E/I balance) within neural microcircuitry.  This hypothesis could unify diverse streams of pathophysiological and genetic evidence, but has not been susceptible to direct testing. Here we design and use  several novel optogenetic tools to causally investigate the cellular E/I balance  hypothesis in freely moving mammals, and explore the associated circuit physiology. Elevation, but not reduction, of cellular E/I balance within the mouse medial prefrontal cortex was found to elicit a profound impairment in cellular information processing, associated with specific behavioural impairments and increased high-frequency power in the 30-80\u2009Hz range, which have both been observed in clinical conditions in humans. Consistent with the E/I balance hypothesis, compensatory elevation of inhibitory cell excitability partially rescued social deficits caused by E/I balance elevation. These results provide support for the elevated cellular E/I balance hypothesis of severe neuropsychiatric disease-related symptoms.", "21632938": "Locomotor sensitization is a common and robust behavioral alteration in rodents whereby following exposure to abused drugs such as cocaine, the animal becomes significantly more hyperactive in response to an acute drug challenge. Here, we further analyzed the role of cocaine-induced silent synapses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and their contribution to the development of locomotor sensitization. Using a combination of viral vector-mediated genetic manipulations, biochemistry, and electrophysiology in a locomotor sensitization paradigm with repeated, daily, noncontingent cocaine (15 mg/kg) injections, we show that dominant-negative cAMP-element binding protein (CREB) prevents cocaine-induced generation of silent synapses of young (30 d old) rats, whereas constitutively active CREB is sufficient to increase the number of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors (NMDARs) at synapses and to generate silent synapses. We further show that occupancy of CREB at the NR2B promoter increases and is causally related to the increase in synaptic NR2B levels. Blockade of NR2B-containing NMDARs by administration of the NR2B-selective antagonist Ro256981 directly into the NAc, under conditions that inhibit cocaine-induced silent synapses, prevents the development of cocaine-elicited locomotor sensitization. Our data are consistent with a cellular cascade whereby cocaine-induced activation of CREB promotes CREB-dependent transcription of NR2B  and synaptic incorporation of NR2B-containing NMDARs, which generates new silent  synapses within the NAc. We propose that cocaine-induced activation of CREB and generation of new silent synapses may serve as key cellular events mediating cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. These findings provide a novel cellular  mechanism that may contribute to cocaine-induced behavioral alterations.", "20620875": "In the basal ganglia, convergent input and dopaminergic modulation of the direct  striatonigral and the indirect striatopallidal pathways are critical in rewarding and aversive learning and drug addiction. To explore how the basal ganglia information is processed and integrated through these two pathways, we developed  a reversible neurotransmission blocking technique, in which transmission of each  pathway was selectively blocked by specific expression of transmission-blocking tetanus toxin in a doxycycline-dependent manner. The results indicated that the coordinated modulation of these two pathways was necessary for dopamine-mediated  acute psychostimulant actions. This modulation, however, shifted to the predominant roles of the direct pathway in reward learning and cocaine sensitization and the indirect pathway in aversive behavior. These two pathways thus have distinct roles: the direct pathway critical for distinguishing associative rewarding stimuli from nonassociative ones and the indirect pathway for rapid memory formation to avoid aversive stimuli.", "20023653": "The Cre/lox system is widely used in mice to achieve cell-type-specific gene expression. However, a strong and universally responding system to express genes  under Cre control is still lacking. We have generated a set of Cre reporter mice  with strong, ubiquitous expression of fluorescent proteins of different spectra.  The robust native fluorescence of these reporters enables direct visualization of fine dendritic structures and axonal projections of the labeled neurons, which is useful in mapping neuronal circuitry, imaging and tracking specific cell populations in vivo. Using these reporters and a high-throughput in situ hybridization platform, we are systematically profiling Cre-directed gene expression throughout the mouse brain in several Cre-driver lines, including new  Cre lines targeting different cell types in the cortex. Our expression data are displayed in a public online database to help researchers assess the utility of various Cre-driver lines for cell-type-specific genetic manipulation.", "19400717": "The basal ganglia occupy the core of the forebrain and consist of evolutionarily  conserved motor nuclei that form recurrent circuits critical for motivation and motor planning. The striatum is the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia and a key neural substrate for procedural learning and memory. The vast majority of striatal neurons are spiny GABAergic projection neurons, which exhibit slow but temporally precise spiking in vivo. Contributing to this precision are several different types of interneurons that constitute only a small fraction of total neuron number but play a critical role in regulating striatal output. This review examines the cellular physiology and modulation of striatal neurons that give rise to their unique properties and function.", "17459351": "In vitro patch-clamp recordings were made to study the membrane properties and synaptic connectivity of fast-spiking interneurons in rat ventral striatum. Using a whole-cell configuration in acutely prepared slices, fast-spiking interneurons  were recognized based on their firing properties and their morphological phenotype was confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Membrane properties of fast-spiking interneurons were distinguished from those of medium-sized spiny neurons by their more depolarized resting membrane potential, lower action potential amplitude and shorter half-width, short spike repolarization time and deep spike afterhyperpolarization. Firing patterns of interneurons could be subdivided in a bursting and non-bursting mode. Simultaneous dual whole-cell recordings revealed a high degree of connectivity of fast-spiking interneurons to medium-sized spiny neurons via unidirectional synapses. Burst firing in fast-spiking interneurons that were presynaptic to medium-sized spiny neurons resulted in barrages of postsynaptic potentials showing an initial amplitude increment, rapidly followed by a decrement. In conclusion, ventral striatal fast-spiking interneurons can be clearly distinguished from medium-sized spiny neurons by their membrane properties and their firing patterns can be subdivided  in bursting and non-bursting modes. Their synaptic connectivity to medium-sized spiny neurons is unidirectional and characterized by frequency-dependent, dynamic changes in postsynaptic amplitude.", "15582369": "The firing of neostriatal spiny neurons in response to an excitatory input is modulated and sculpted by a variety of factors. Neostriatal interneurons are phenotypically diverse and have properties that enable them to specifically, but  differentially, influence the activity of spiny neurons. Each of the three types  of GABAergic interneurons produces a strong inhibitory postsynaptic potential in  spiny neurons, the function of which is probably to influence the precise timing  of action potential firing in either individual or ensembles of spiny neurons. By contrast, the role of cholinergic interneurons is to modulate the sub- and supra-threshold responses of spiny neurons to cortical and/or thalamic excitation, particularly in reward-related activities. Both classes of interneurons are important sites of action of neuromodulators in neostriatum, and act in different but complementary ways to modify the activity of the spiny projection neurons.", "15464124": "Persistent changes in behavior and psychological function that occur as a function of experience, such those associated with learning and memory, are thought to be due to the reorganization of synaptic connections (structural plasticity) in relevant brain circuits. Some of the most compelling examples of experience-dependent changes in behavior and psychological function, changes that can last a lifetime, are those that accrue with the development of addictions. However, until recently, there has been almost no research on whether potentially addictive drugs produce forms of structural plasticity similar to those associated with other forms of experience-dependent plasticity. In this paper we  summarize evidence that, indeed, exposure to amphetamine, cocaine, nicotine or morphine produces persistent changes in the structure of dendrites and dendritic  spines on cells in brain regions involved in incentive motivation and reward (such as the nucleus accumbens), and judgment and the inhibitory control of behavior (such as the prefrontal cortex). It is suggested that structural plasticity associated with exposure to drugs of abuse reflects a reorganization of patterns of synaptic connectivity in these neural systems, a reorganization that alters their operation, thus contributing to some of the persistent sequela  associated with drug use--including addiction.", "14573550": "Dual whole cell patch-clamp recordings in rat nucleus accumbens, the main component of the ventral striatum, were made to assess the presence of synaptic interconnections between medium-sized spiny neurons, a group of GABAergic and peptidergic neurons that constitute the principal cells of the striatum. Neurons  were stained with biocytin for subsequent morphological analysis. Electrical activity of cells was recorded in current- and voltage-clamp mode; the characteristics of medium-sized spiny neurons were confirmed by electrophysiological and morphological properties. Thirteen of 38 medium-sized spiny neuron pairs (34%) showed a synaptic connection. In these pairs, suprathreshold stimulation with current injection evoked a train of action potentials in the presynaptic cell, which in turn elicited depolarizing postsynaptic potentials (dPSPs) in the postsynaptic cell. Twelve of these 13 pairs were connected unilaterally. The onset latency of the postsynaptic response was 1.7 +/- 0.7 ms. dPSPs were blocked by 12.5 microM bicuculline, suggesting they were mediated by GABA(A) receptors. A linear fit of the current-voltage relationship of GABAergic currents crossed the voltage axis near the value of -20 mV, in agreement with the Cl(-) equilibrium potential predicted from the composition of the artificial cerebrospinal fluid and pipette medium. No evidence for electrotonic coupling was found. Paired-pulse facilitation and depression were induced when the amplitude of the first IPSC of a pair was relatively small  and large, respectively. No clear dependence of paired-pulse facilitation or depression was found on the width of the spike interval, which ranged between 100 and 380 ms. Conversely, 1- to 2-s trains of dPSPs showed marked frequency facilitation at low presynaptic frequencies, but frequency depression at high firing rates. These data show that intra-accumbens synaptic communication between medium-sized spiny neurons exists, is mediated by GABA(A) receptors, and exhibits spike train-dependent short-term dynamics.", "8953303": "Neurophysiological responses mediated by projections from five telencephalic and  diencephalic regions (the infra- and prelimbic portions of the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, entorhinal cortex and subiculum/CA1) to the caudate/putamen (CPu) and nucleus accumbens (Acb) of the dorsal and ventral striatum were studied in chloral-hydrate-anesthetized rats. Both extra- and intracellular in vivo recording techniques were used. A retrograde tracer (wheatgerm agglutinin-apo-horseradish peroxidase-5 nm colloidal Gold) was deposited in some animals in the vicinity of recording sites to confirm that stimulating electrodes were located near cells that projected to the striatum. Electrical stimulation of these five regions, respectively, evoked excitatory responses in 60%, 22%, 51%, 25%, and 17% of striatal neurons. Some responses, particularly with thalamic stimulation, showed short-term frequency potentiation in which 5/s stimulation increased the probability of spike firing.  About half of responsive cells showed convergent excitation to more than one stimulating site. It was possible with convergent excitatory responses to show synaptic interactions: simultaneous activation of more than one site produced spatial and temporal summation to increase the probability of spike firing. Up to 5-way convergence onto single striatal neurons and up to 3-way interactions could be shown. These results indicate that functional influences from the hippocampal  formation can converge with other excitatory input onto single striatal neurons to effect synaptic integration.", "26030846": "Author information:  (1)1] Fishberg Department of Neuroscience, Friedman Brain Institute Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.

The NAc receives glutamatergic inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ventral hippocampus (vHIP) and basolateral amygdala (AMY). Here, we demonstrate that glutamatergic vHIP afferents to NAc regulate susceptibility to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). We observe reduced activity in vHIP in mice  resilient to CSDS. Furthermore, attenuation of vHIP-NAc transmission by optogenetic induction of long-term depression is pro-resilient, whereas acute enhancement of this input is pro-susceptible. This effect is specific to vHIP afferents to the NAc, as optogenetic stimulation of either mPFC or AMY afferents  to the NAc is pro-resilient. These data indicate that vHIP afferents to NAc uniquely regulate susceptibility to CSDS, highlighting an important, novel circuit-specific mechanism in depression.", "24975023": "Heightened reactivity of the incentive-motivation system has been proposed to underlie adolescent-typical risky behaviors, including problem alcohol involvement. However, even in adolescence considerable individual variation in these behaviors exists, which may have genetic underpinnings and be related to variations in risk for later alcohol use disorder (AUD). Variants in GABRA2 have  been associated with adult alcohol dependence as well as phenotypic precursors, including impulsiveness and externalizing behaviors. We investigated the impact of GABRA2 on the developmental trajectory of nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activation  during anticipation of monetary reward from childhood to young adulthood. Functional MRI during a monetary incentive delay task was collected in 175 participants, with the majority (n = 151) undergoing repeated scanning at 1- to 2-year intervals. One group entered the study at age 8-13 years (n = 76) and another entered at age 18-23 years (n = 99). Most participants were children of alcoholics (79%) and thus at heightened risk for AUD. A total of 473 sessions were completed, covering ages 8-27 years. NAcc activation was heightened during adolescence compared with childhood and young adulthood. GABRA2 genotype (SNP rs279858) was associated with individual differences in NAcc activation specifically during adolescence, with the minor allele (G) associated with greater activation. Furthermore, NAcc activation mediated an effect of genotype on alcohol problems (n = 104). This work demonstrates an impact of GABRA2 genotype on incentive-motivation neurocircuitry in adolescence, with implications for vulnerability to alcoholism. These findings represent an important step toward understanding the genetic and neural basis of individual differences in how risk for addiction unfolds across development.", "24431441": "Within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), synaptic GABAA receptors (GABAARs) mediate phasic inhibition of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and influence behavioral responses to cocaine. We demonstrate that both dopamine D1- and D2-receptor-expressing MSNs (D-MSNs) additionally harbor extrasynaptic GABAARs incorporating \u03b14, \u03b2, and \u03b4 subunits that mediate tonic inhibition, thereby influencing neuronal excitability. Both the selective \u03b4-GABAAR agonist THIP and DS2, a selective positive allosteric modulator, greatly increased the tonic current of all MSNs from wild-type (WT), but not from \u03b4(-/-) or \u03b14(-/-) mice. Coupling dopamine and tonic inhibition, the acute activation of D1 receptors (by  a selective agonist or indirectly by amphetamine) greatly enhanced tonic inhibition in D1-MSNs but not D2-MSNs. In contrast, prolonged D2 receptor activation modestly reduced the tonic conductance of D2-MSNs. Behaviorally, WT and constitutive \u03b14(-/-) mice did not differ in their expression of cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP). Importantly, however, mice with the \u03b14 deletion specific to D1-expressing neurons (\u03b14(D1-/-)) showed increased CPP. Furthermore, THIP administered systemically or directly into the NAc of WT, but not \u03b14(-/-) or \u03b14(D1-/-) mice, blocked cocaine enhancement of CPP. In comparison, \u03b14(D2-/-) mice exhibited normal CPP, but no cocaine enhancement. In conclusion, dopamine modulation of GABAergic tonic inhibition of D1- and D2-MSNs provides an  intrinsic mechanism to differentially affect their excitability in response to psychostimulants and thereby influence their ability to potentiate conditioned reward. Therefore, \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABAARs may represent a viable target for the development of novel therapeutics to better understand and influence addictive behaviors.", "20109488": "This review focuses on cocaine-induced postsynaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) involving changes in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) transmission. First, fundamental properties of AMPAR in the NAc are reviewed. Then, we provide a detailed and critical analysis of literature demonstrating alterations in AMPAR transmission in association with behavioral sensitization to cocaine and cocaine  self-administration. We conclude that cocaine exposure leads to changes in AMPAR  transmission that depend on many factors including whether exposure is contingent or non-contingent, the duration of withdrawal, and whether extinction training has occurred. The relationship between changes in AMPAR transmission and responding to cocaine or cocaine-paired cues can also be affected by these variables. However, after prolonged withdrawal in the absence of extinction training, our findings and others lead us to propose that AMPAR transmission is enhanced, resulting in stronger responding to drug-paired cues. Finally, many results indicate that the state of synaptic transmission in the NAc after cocaine exposure is associated with impairment of AMPAR-dependent plasticity. This may contribute to a broad range of addiction-related behavioral changes.", "12597856": "Drug seeking and drug self-administration in both animals and humans can be triggered by drugs of abuse themselves or by stressful events. Here, we demonstrate that in vivo administration of drugs of abuse with different molecular mechanisms of action as well as acute stress both increase strength at  excitatory synapses on midbrain dopamine neurons. Psychoactive drugs with minimal abuse potential do not cause this change. The synaptic effects of stress, but not of cocaine, are blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486. These results suggest that plasticity at excitatory synapses on dopamine neurons may be a key neural adaptation contributing to addiction and its interactions with stress and thus may be an attractive therapeutic target for reducing the risk of  addiction.", "11007908": "The dopaminergic innervation of the nucleus accumbens is generally agreed to mediate the primary reinforcing and locomotor effects of psychostimulants, but there is less consensus on conditioned dopamine (DA) release during drug-seeking  behavior. We investigated the neurochemical correlates of drug-seeking behavior under the control of a drug-associated cue [a light conditioned stimulus (CS+)] and to noncontingent presentations of the CS+ in the core and shell subregions of the nucleus accumbens. Rats self-administered cocaine under a continuous reinforcement schedule in which a response on one of two identical levers led to  an intravenous cocaine infusion (0.25 mg/infusion) and a 20 sec light CS+. Response requirements for cocaine and the CS+ were then progressively increased until stable responding was established under a second-order schedule of reinforcement. During microdialysis, rats were presented noncontingently with a set of 10 sec CS+ and neutral tone stimuli (CS-) before and after a 90 min period during which they responded for cocaine under a second-order schedule. Results showed the following: (1) nucleus accumbens DA increased in both the core and shell during intravenous cocaine self-administration; (2) noncontingent presentations of a cocaine-associated CS+ led to increased DA release selectively in the nucleus accumbens core; and (3) extracellular DA levels were unaltered in  both core and shell during a protracted period of drug-seeking behavior under the control of the same cocaine-associated cue. These results indicate that the mesolimbic dopamine system is activated after exposure to drug-associated stimuli under specific conditions.", "22588352": "Brainstem noradrenergic neurons innervate the mesocorticolimbic reward pathway both directly and indirectly, with norepinephrine facilitating dopamine (DA) neurotransmission via \u03b11-adrenergic receptors (\u03b11ARs). Although \u03b11AR signaling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) promotes mesolimbic transmission and drug-induced behaviors, the potential contribution of \u03b11ARs in other parts of the pathway, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), has not been investigated before. We found that local blockade of \u03b11ARs in the medial NAc shell, but not the VTA, attenuates cocaine- and morphine-induced locomotion. To determine the neuronal substrates that could mediate these effects, we analyzed the cellular, subcellular, and subsynaptic localization of \u03b11ARs and characterized the chemical phenotypes of \u03b11AR-containing elements within the mesocorticolimbic system using single and double immunocytochemical methods at the electron microscopic (EM) level. We found that \u03b11ARs are found mainly extra-synaptically in axons and axon terminals in the NAc and are enriched in glutamatergic and dopaminergic elements. \u03b11ARs are also abundant in glutamatergic terminals in the PFC, and in GABA-positive terminals in the VTA. In line with these observations, microdialysis experiments revealed that local blockade of \u03b11ARs attenuated the increase in extracellular DA in the medial NAc shell following administration of cocaine. These data indicate that local \u03b11ARs control DA transmission in the medial NAc shell and behavioral responses to drugs of abuse.", "21144997": "Midbrain dopamine neurons are well known for their strong responses to rewards and their critical role in\u00a0positive motivation. It has become increasingly clear, however, that dopamine neurons also transmit signals related to salient but nonrewarding experiences such as aversive and alerting events. Here we review recent advances in understanding the reward and nonreward functions of dopamine.  Based on this data, we propose that dopamine neurons come in multiple types that  are connected with distinct brain networks and have distinct roles in motivational control. Some dopamine neurons encode motivational value, supporting brain networks for seeking, evaluation, and value learning. Others encode motivational salience, supporting brain networks for orienting, cognition, and general motivation. Both types of dopamine neurons are augmented by an alerting signal involved in rapid detection of potentially important sensory cues. We hypothesize that these dopaminergic pathways for value, salience, and alerting cooperate to support adaptive behavior.", "28426970": "The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is thought to regulate behavioral responses under emotionally arousing conditions. Reward-associated cues activate PVT neurons; however, the specific PVT efferents regulating reward  seeking remain elusive. Using a cued sucrose-seeking task, we manipulated PVT activity under two emotionally distinct conditions: (1) when reward was available during the cue as expected or (2) when reward was unexpectedly omitted during the cue. Pharmacological inactivation of the anterior PVT (aPVT), but not the posterior PVT, increased sucrose seeking only when reward was omitted. Consistent with this, photoactivation of aPVT neurons abolished sucrose seeking, and the firing of aPVT neurons differentiated reward availability. Photoinhibition of aPVT projections to the nucleus accumbens or to the amygdala increased or decreased, respectively, sucrose seeking only when reward was omitted. Our findings suggest that PVT bidirectionally modulates sucrose seeking under the negative (frustrative) conditions of reward omission.", "28167674": "The ventral striatum is involved in motivated behavior. Akin to the dorsal striatum, the ventral striatum contains two parallel pathways: the striatomesencephalic pathway consisting of dopamine receptor Type 1-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) and the striatopallidal pathway consisting of D2-MSNs. These two genetically identified pathways are thought to encode opposing functions in motivated behavior. It has also been reported that D1/D2 genetic selectivity is not attributed to the anatomical discrimination of two pathways. We wanted to determine whether D1- and D2-MSNs in the ventral striatum functioned in an opposing manner as previous observations claimed, and whether D1/D2 selectivity corresponded to a functional segregation in motivated behavior of mice. To address this question, we focused on the lateral portion of ventral striatum as a region implicated in food-incentive, goal-directed behavior, and recorded D1 or D2-MSN activity by using a gene-encoded ratiometric Ca2+ indicator and by constructing a fiberphotometry system, and manipulated their activities via optogenetic inhibition during ongoing behaviors. We observed concurrent event-related compound Ca2+ elevations in ventrolateral D1- and D2-MSNs, especially at trial start cue-related and first lever press-related times. D1 or  D2 selective optogenetic inhibition just after the trial start cue resulted in a  reduction of goal-directed behavior, indicating a shared coding of motivated behavior by both populations at this time. Only D1-selective inhibition just after the first lever press resulted in the reduction of behavior, indicating D1-MSN-specific coding at that specific time. Our data did not support opposing encoding by both populations in food-incentive, goal-directed behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT An opposing role of dopamine receptor Type 1 or Type 2-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs or D2-MSNs) on striatum-mediated  behaviors has been widely accepted. However, this idea has been questioned by recent reports. In the present study, we measured concurrent Ca2+ activity patterns of D1- and D2-MSNs in the ventrolateral striatum during food-incentive,  goal-directed behavior in mice. According to Ca2+ activity patterns, we conducted timing-specific optogenetic inhibition of each type of MSN. We demonstrated that  both D1- and D2-MSNs in the ventrolateral striatum commonly and positively encoded action initiation, whereas only D1-MSNs positively encoded sustained motivated behavior. These findings led us to reconsider the prevailing notion of  a functional segregation of MSN activity in the ventral striatum.", "27383008": "Urges to eat are influenced by stimuli in the environment that are associated with food (food cues). Obese people are more sensitive to food cues, reporting stronger craving and consuming larger portions after food cue exposure. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediates cue-triggered motivational responses, and activations in the NAc triggered by food cues are stronger in people who are susceptible to obesity. This has led to the idea that alterations in NAc function similar to those underlying drug addiction may contribute to obesity, particularly in obesity-susceptible individuals. Motivational responses are mediated in part by NAc AMPA receptor (AMPAR) transmission, and recent work shows that cue-triggered motivation is enhanced in obesity-susceptible rats after 'junk-food' diet consumption. Therefore, here we determined whether NAc AMPAR expression and function is increased by 'junk-food' diet consumption in obesity-susceptible vs -resistant populations using both outbred and selectively  bred models of susceptibility. In addition, cocaine-induced locomotor activity was used as a general 'read out' of mesolimbic function after 'junk-food' consumption. We found a sensitized locomotor response to cocaine in rats that gained weight on a 'junk-food' diet, consistent with greater responsivity of mesolimbic circuits in obesity-susceptible groups. In addition, eating 'junk-food' increased NAc calcium-permeable-AMPAR (CP-AMPAR) function only in obesity-susceptible rats. This increase occurred rapidly, persisted for weeks after 'junk-food' consumption ceased, and preceded the development of obesity. These data are considered in light of enhanced cue-triggered motivation and striatal function in obesity-susceptible rats and the role of NAc CP-AMPARs in enhanced motivation and addiction.", "27074816": "Exposure to cocaine induces addiction-associated behaviors partially through remodeling neurocircuits in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The paraventricular nucleus of thalamus (PVT), which projects to the NAc monosynaptically, is activated by cocaine exposure and has been implicated in several cocaine-induced  emotional and motivational states. Here we show that disrupting synaptic transmission of select PVT neurons with tetanus toxin activated via retrograde trans-synaptic transport of cre from NAc efferents decreased cocaine self-administration in rats. This projection underwent complex adaptations after  self-administration of cocaine (0.75\u2009mg/kg/infusion; 2\u2009h/d \u00d7 5 d, 1d overnight training). Specifically, 1d after cocaine self-administration, we observed increased levels of AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-silent glutamatergic synapses in this projection, accompanied by a decreased ratio of AMPAR-to-NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated EPSCs. Furthermore, the decay kinetics of NMDAR EPSCs was significantly prolonged, suggesting insertion of new GluN2B-containing NMDARs to  PVT-to-NAc synapses. After 45-d withdrawal, silent synapses within this projection returned to the basal levels, accompanied by a return of the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio and NMDAR decay kinetics to the basal levels. In amygdala and infralimbic prefrontal cortical projections to the NAc, a portion of cocaine-generated silent synapses becomes unsilenced by recruiting calcium-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) after drug withdrawal. However, the sensitivity of PVT-to-NAc synapses to CP-AMPAR-selective antagonists was not changed after withdrawal, suggesting that CP-AMPAR trafficking is not involved in the evolution of cocaine-generated silent synapses within this projection. Meanwhile, the release probability of PVT-to-NAc synapses was increased after short- and long-term cocaine withdrawal. These results reveal complex and profound alterations at PVT-to-NAc synapses after cocaine exposure and withdrawal.", "27019014": "The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is best known for its dopamine neurons, some of  which project to nucleus accumbens (nAcc). However, the VTA also has glutamatergic neurons that project to nAcc. The function of the mesoaccumbens glutamatergic pathway remains unknown. Here we report that nAcc photoactivation of mesoaccumbens glutamatergic fibers promotes aversion. Although we found that these mesoaccumbens glutamatergic fibers lack GABA, the aversion evoked by their  photoactivation depended on glutamate- and GABA-receptor signaling, and not on dopamine-receptor signaling. We found that mesoaccumbens glutamatergic fibers established multiple asymmetric synapses on single parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons and that nAcc photoactivation of these fibers drove AMPA-mediated cellular firing of parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons. These parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons in turn inhibited nAcc medium spiny output neurons, thereby controlling inhibitory neurotransmission in nAcc. To our knowledge, the mesoaccumbens glutamatergic pathway is the first glutamatergic input to nAcc shown to mediate aversion instead of reward, and the first pathway shown to establish excitatory synapses on nAcc parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons.", "26840481": "Chronic opiate use induces opiate dependence, which is characterized by extremely unpleasant physical and emotional feelings after drug use is terminated. Both the rewarding effects of a drug and the desire to avoid withdrawal symptoms motivate  continued drug use, and the nucleus accumbens is important for orchestrating both processes. While multiple inputs to the nucleus accumbens regulate reward, little is known about the nucleus accumbens circuitry underlying withdrawal. Here we identify the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus as a prominent input to the  nucleus accumbens mediating the expression of opiate-withdrawal-induced physical  signs and aversive memory. Activity in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus to nucleus accumbens pathway is necessary and sufficient to mediate behavioural aversion. Selectively silencing this pathway abolishes aversive symptoms in two different mouse models of opiate withdrawal. Chronic morphine exposure selectively potentiates excitatory transmission between the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus and D2-receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons via synaptic insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors. Notably, in vivo  optogenetic depotentiation restores normal transmission at these synapses and robustly suppresses morphine withdrawal symptoms. This links morphine-evoked pathway- and cell-type-specific plasticity in the paraventricular nucleus of the  thalamus to nucleus accumbens circuit to opiate dependence, and suggests that reprogramming this circuit holds promise for treating opiate addiction.", "25644383": "Author information:  (1)Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Center for Neuroscience, University of Colorado, Boulder, Boulder, CO, USA.

Here we show that silent synapse-based remodeling of the two major mPFC-to-NAc projections differentially  regulated the progressive increase in cue-induced cocaine seeking after withdrawal (incubation of cocaine craving). Specifically, cocaine self-administration in rats generated AMPA receptor-silent glutamatergic synapses within both infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic mPFC (PrL) to NAc projections, measured after 1 day of withdrawal. After 45 days of withdrawal, IL-to-NAc silent synapses became unsilenced/matured by recruiting calcium-permeable (CP) AMPARs, whereas PrL-to-NAc silent synapses matured by recruiting non-CP-AMPARs, resulting in differential remodeling of these projections. Optogenetic reversal of silent synapse-based remodeling of IL-to-NAc and PrL-to-NAc projections potentiated and  inhibited, respectively, incubation of cocaine craving on withdrawal day 45. Thus, pro- and antirelapse circuitry remodeling is induced in parallel after cocaine self-administration. These results may provide substrates for utilizing endogenous antirelapse mechanisms to reduce cocaine relapse.", "24904419": "Opioids selective for the G protein-coupled mu opioid receptor (MOR) produce potent analgesia and euphoria. Heroin, a synthetic opioid, is considered one of the most addictive substances, and the recent exponential rise in opioid addiction and overdose deaths has made treatment development a national public health priority. Existing medications (methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone), when combined with psychosocial therapies, have proven efficacy in reducing aspects of opioid addiction. Unfortunately, these medications have critical limitations including those associated with opioid agonist therapies (e.g., sustained physiological dependence and opioid withdrawal leading to high relapse  rates upon discontinuation), non-adherence to daily dosing, and non-renewal of monthly injection with extended-release naltrexone. Furthermore, current medications fail to ameliorate key aspects of addiction such as powerful conditioned associations that trigger relapse (e.g., cues, stress, the drug itself). Thus, there is a need for developing novel treatments that target neural processes corrupted with chronic opioid use. This requires a basic understanding  of molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying effects of opioids on synaptic transmission and plasticity within reward-related neural circuits. The focus of this review is to discuss how crosstalk between MOR-associated G protein signaling and glutamatergic neurotransmission leads to immediate and long-term effects on emotional states (e.g., euphoria, depression) and motivated behavior (e.g., drug-seeking, relapse). Our goal is to integrate findings on how opioids modulate synaptic release of glutamate and postsynaptic transmission via \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area with the clinical (neurobehavioral) progression of opioid dependence, as well as to identify gaps in knowledge that can be addressed in future studies.", "24496610": "Addiction is characterized as a chronic relapsing disorder whereby addicted individuals persistently engage in drug seeking and use despite profound negative consequences. The results of studies using animal models of addiction and relapse indicate that drug seeking is mediated by alterations in cortico-accumbal plasticity induced by chronic drug exposure. Among the maladaptive responses to drug exposure are long-lasting alterations in the expression of proteins localized to accumbal astrocytes, which are responsible for maintaining glutamate homeostasis. These alterations engender an aberrant potentiation of glutamate transmission in the cortico-accumbens circuit that is linked to the reinstatement of drug seeking. Accordingly, pharmacological restoration of glutamate homeostasis functions as an efficient method of reversing drug-induced plasticity and inhibiting drug seeking in both rodents and humans.", "24459410": "Publisher: Lo central de la drogadicci\u00f3n, a pesar de la importancia de los numerosos factores psicosociales, es que implica un proceso biol\u00f3gico.

Morphine treatment activates microglia and astrocytes in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) to induce the synthesis of cytokines and chemokines, and this has important implications for addictive behavior. Blocking morphine-induced glial activation using the nonspecific glial inhibitor, ibudilast, has no effect on the initial rewarding properties of morphine, but completely prevents the relapse of  drug-seeking behavior months later. OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the cellular source of these cytokines and chemokines in the NAcc in response to morphine, and the cell-type-specific expression pattern of their receptors to determine whether neurons have the capacity to respond to these immune signals directly. METHODS: We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting of neurons (Thy1+), astrocytes (GLT1+), and microglia (CD11b+) from the NAcc for the analysis of cell type specific gene expression following morphine or saline treatment. RESULTS: The results indicate that microglia and neurons each produce a subset of chemokines in response to morphine and that neurons have the capacity to respond  directly to a select group of these chemokines via their receptors. In addition,  we provide evidence that microglia are capable of responding directly to dopamine release in the NAcc. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies will examine the mechanism(s) by which neurons respond to these immune signals produced by microglia in an effort to understand  their effect on addictive behaviors.", "23686171": "NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels and are crucial for neuronal communication. NMDARs form tetrameric complexes that consist of several  homologous subunits. The subunit composition of NMDARs is plastic, resulting in a large number of receptor subtypes. As each receptor subtype has distinct biophysical, pharmacological and signalling properties, there is great interest in determining whether individual subtypes carry out specific functions in the CNS in both normal and pathological conditions. Here, we review the effects of subunit composition on NMDAR properties, synaptic plasticity and cellular mechanisms implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Understanding the rules and  roles of NMDAR diversity could provide new therapeutic strategies against dysfunctions of glutamatergic transmission.", "23467346": "The transcription factor \u0394FosB and the brain-enriched calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII\u03b1) are induced in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) by chronic exposure to cocaine or other psychostimulant drugs of abuse, in which the two proteins mediate sensitized drug responses. Although \u0394FosB and CaMKII\u03b1 both regulate AMPA glutamate receptor expression and function in NAc, dendritic spine formation on NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs), and locomotor sensitization to cocaine, no direct link between these molecules has to date been explored. Here, we demonstrate that \u0394FosB is phosphorylated by CaMKII\u03b1 at the protein-stabilizing Ser27 and that CaMKII is required for the cocaine-mediated accumulation of \u0394FosB in rat NAc. Conversely, we show that \u0394FosB is both necessary and sufficient for cocaine induction of CaMKII\u03b1 gene expression in vivo, an effect selective for D1-type MSNs in the NAc shell subregion. Furthermore, induction of dendritic spines on NAc MSNs and increased behavioral responsiveness to cocaine after NAc overexpression of \u0394FosB are both CaMKII dependent. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time induction of \u0394FosB and  CaMKII in the NAc of human cocaine addicts, suggesting possible targets for future therapeutic intervention. These data establish that \u0394FosB and CaMKII engage in a cell-type- and brain-region-specific positive feedforward loop as a key mechanism for regulating the reward circuitry of the brain in response to chronic cocaine.", "23385114": "Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) are important modulators of excitatory synaptic transmission and therefore potential targets for drug development. In several brain regions (ventral tegmental area (VTA), cerebellum,  and amygdala), stimulation of mGluR1 selectively inhibits synaptic transmission mediated by calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) and thus produces synaptic depression. The same relationship has now been demonstrated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region that is critical for cocaine craving. CP-AMPAR  levels in NAc synapses are normally low, but they increase after prolonged withdrawal from extended-access cocaine self-administration (SA). These CP-AMPARs mediate the intensified ('incubated') cue-induced cocaine craving observed under  these conditions. Therefore, activation of mGluR1 with positive allosteric modulators (PAM) may reduce cue-induced relapse in abstinent cocaine addicts.", "23237885": "One of the defining characteristics of the research of Ann E. Kelley was her recognition that the neuroscience underlying basic learning and motivation processes also shed significant light upon mechanisms underlying drug addiction and maladaptive eating patterns. In this review, we examine the parallels that exist in the neural pathways that process both food and drug reward, as determined by recent studies in animal models and human neuroimaging experiments. We discuss contemporary research that suggests that hyperphagia leading to obesity is associated with substantial neurochemical changes in the brain. These  findings verify the relevance of reward pathways for promoting consumption of palatable, calorically dense foods, and lead to the important question of whether changes in reward circuitry in response to intake of such foods serve a causal role in the development and maintenance of some cases of obesity. Finally, we discuss the potential value for future studies at the intersection of the obesity epidemic and the neuroscience of motivation, as well as the potential concerns that arise from viewing excessive food intake as an \"addiction\". We suggest that  it might be more useful to focus on overeating that results in frank obesity, and multiple health, interpersonal, and occupational negative consequences as a form  of food \"abuse\".", "22895704": "Opioid action was thought to exert reinforcing effects solely via the initial agonism of opioid receptors. Here, we present evidence for an additional novel contributor to opioid reward: the innate immune pattern-recognition receptor, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and its MyD88-dependent signaling. Blockade of TLR4/MD2 by administration of the nonopioid, unnatural isomer of naloxone, (+)-naloxone (rats), or two independent genetic knock-outs of MyD88-TLR4-dependent signaling (mice), suppressed opioid-induced conditioned place preference. (+)-Naloxone also reduced opioid (remifentanil) self-administration (rats), another commonly used behavioral measure of drug reward. Moreover, pharmacological blockade of morphine-TLR4/MD2 activity potently reduced morphine-induced elevations of extracellular dopamine in rat nucleus accumbens, a region critical for opioid reinforcement. Importantly, opioid-TLR4 actions are not a unidirectional influence on opioid pharmacodynamics, since TLR4(-/-) mice had reduced oxycodone-induced p38 and JNK phosphorylation, while displaying potentiated analgesia. Similar to our recent reports of morphine-TLR4/MD2 binding, here we provide a combination of in silico and biophysical data to support (+)-naloxone and remifentanil binding to TLR4/MD2. Collectively, these data indicate that the actions of opioids at classical opioid receptors, together with their newly identified TLR4/MD2 actions, affect the mesolimbic dopamine system that amplifies opioid-induced elevations in extracellular dopamine levels, therefore possibly explaining altered opioid reward behaviors. Thus, the discovery of TLR4/MD2 recognition of opioids as foreign xenobiotic substances adds to the existing hypothesized neuronal reinforcement mechanisms, identifies a new drug target in TLR4/MD2 for the treatment of addictions, and provides further evidence supporting a role for central proinflammatory immune signaling in drug reward.", "22632727": "Microglia are the resident CNS immune cells and active surveyors of the extracellular environment. While past work has focused on the role of these cells during disease, recent imaging studies reveal dynamic interactions between microglia and synaptic elements in the healthy brain. Despite these intriguing observations, the precise function of microglia at remodeling synapses and the mechanisms that underlie microglia-synapse interactions remain elusive. In the current study, we demonstrate a role for microglia in activity-dependent synaptic pruning in the postnatal retinogeniculate system. We show that microglia engulf presynaptic inputs during peak retinogeniculate pruning and that engulfment is dependent upon neural activity and the microglia-specific phagocytic signaling pathway, complement receptor 3(CR3)/C3. Furthermore, disrupting microglia-specific CR3/C3 signaling resulted in sustained deficits in synaptic connectivity. These results define a role for microglia during postnatal development and identify underlying mechanisms by which microglia engulf and remodel developing synapses.", "22275885": "Extracellular glutamate of glial origin modulates glial and neuronal glutamate release and synaptic plasticity. Estimates of the tonic basal concentration of extracellular glutamate range over three orders of magnitude (0.02-20\u2009\u03bcM) depending on the technology employed to make the measurement. Based upon binding  constants for glutamate receptors and transporters, this range of concentrations  translates into distinct physiological and pathophysiological roles for extracellular glutamate. Here we speculate that the difference in glutamate measurements can be explained if there is patterned membrane surface expression of glutamate release and transporter sites creating extracellular subcompartments that vary in glutamate concentration and are preferentially sampled by different  technologies.", "22137594": "BACKGROUND: Relapse to cocaine seeking has been linked with low glutamate in the  nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) causing potentiation of synaptic glutamate transmission from prefrontal cortex (PFC) afferents. Systemic N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to restore glutamate homeostasis, reduce relapse to cocaine  seeking, and depotentiate PFC-NAcore synapses. Here, we examine the effects of NAC applied directly to the NAcore on relapse and neurotransmission in PFC-NAcore synapses, as well as the involvement of the metabotropic glutamate receptors 2/3  (mGluR2/3) and 5 (mGluR5). METHODS: Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine for 2 weeks and following extinction received either intra-accumbens NAC or systemic NAC 30 or 120 minutes, respectively, before inducing reinstatement with a conditioned cue or a combined  cue and cocaine injection. We also recorded postsynaptic currents using in vitro  whole cell recordings in acute slices and measured cystine and glutamate uptake in primary glial cultures. RESULTS: NAC microinjection into the NAcore inhibited the reinstatement of cocaine seeking. In slices, a low concentration of NAC reduced the amplitude of evoked glutamatergic synaptic currents in the NAcore in an mGluR2/3-dependent manner, while high doses of NAC increased amplitude in an mGluR5-dependent manner. Both effects depended on NAC uptake through cysteine transporters and activity of the cysteine/glutamate exchanger. Finally, we showed that by blocking mGluR5 the inhibition of cocaine seeking by NAC was potentiated. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of NAC on relapse to cocaine seeking depends on the balance between stimulating mGluR2/3 and mGluR5 in the NAcore, and the efficacy of NAC can be improved by simultaneously inhibiting mGluR5.", "21994370": "Following prolonged withdrawal from extended access cocaine self-administration in adult rats, high conductance Ca2+ -ermeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) accumulate in nucleus accumbens (NAc) synapses and mediate the expression of \"incubated\" cue-induced cocaine craving. Using patch-clamp recordings from NAc slices prepared after extended access cocaine self-administration and >45 d of withdrawal, we found that group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) stimulation using 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG; 50 \u03bcm) rapidly eliminates the postsynaptic CP-AMPAR contribution to NAc synaptic transmission. This is accompanied by facilitation of Ca2+ -impermeable AMPAR (CI-AMPAR)-mediated transmission, suggesting that DHPG may promote an exchange between CP-AMPARs and  CI-AMPARs. In saline controls, DHPG also reduced excitatory transmission but this occurred through a CB1 receptor-dependent presynaptic mechanism rather than an effect on postsynaptic AMPARs. Blockade of CB1 receptors had no significant effect on the alterations in AMPAR transmission produced by DHPG in the cocaine group. Interestingly, the effect of DHPG in the cocaine group was mediated by mGluR1 whereas its effect in the saline group was mediated by mGluR5. These results indicate that regulation of synaptic transmission in the NAc is profoundly altered after extended access cocaine self-administration and prolonged withdrawal. Furthermore, they suggest that activation of mGluR1 may represent a potential strategy for reducing cue-induced cocaine craving in abstinent cocaine addicts.", "21519339": "The repeated use of drugs that directly or indirectly stimulate dopamine transmission carry addiction liability and produce enduring pathological changes  in the brain circuitry that normally regulates adaptive behavioral responding to  a changing environment. This circuitry is rich in glutamatergic projections, and  addiction-related behaviors in animal models have been linked to impairments in excitatory synaptic plasticity. Among the best-characterized glutamatergic projection in this circuit is the prefrontal efferent to the nucleus accumbens. A variety of molecular adaptations have been identified in the prefrontal glutamate synapses in the accumbens, many of which are induced by different classes of addictive drugs. Based largely on work with cocaine, we hypothesize that the drug-induced adaptations impair synaptic plasticity in the cortico-accumbens projection, and thereby dysregulate the ability of addicts to control their drug-taking habits. Accordingly, we go on to describe the literature implicating  the drug-induced changes in protein content or function that impinge upon synaptic plasticity and have been targeted in preclinical models of relapse and,  in some cases, in pilot clinical trials. Based upon modeling drug-induced impairments in neuroplasticity in the cortico-accumbens pathway, we argue for a concerted effort to clinically evaluate the hypothesis that targeting glial and neuronal proteins regulating excitatory synaptic plasticity may prove beneficial  in treating addiction.", "21490215": "Repeated noncontingent cocaine injections, which lead to behavioral sensitization, increase AMPA receptor (AMPAR) transmission in the rodent nucleus  accumbens (NAc) in a withdrawal-dependent manner. On withdrawal days (WD) 10-21,  this is attributable to upregulation of GluA1A2-containing AMPARs. However, synaptic incorporation of GluA2-lacking/Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) was observed after longer withdrawal (WD35) from repeated noncontingent cocaine injections in young mice (Mameli et al., 2009). CP-AMPARs had previously been observed in NAc synapses only after prolonged (WD30-WD47) withdrawal from extended-access cocaine self-administration. Our goal was to determine whether rats receiving repeated noncontingent cocaine injections during adulthood similarly exhibit CP-AMPARs in the NAc after prolonged withdrawal. For comparison, we began by evaluating CP-AMPARs on WD35-WD49 after extended-access cocaine self-administration. Confirming our previous results, whole-cell recordings revealed inwardly rectifying AMPAR EPSCs, a hallmark of CP-AMPARs. This was observed in both core and shell. Next, we conducted the same analysis in adult rats treated with eight daily noncontingent cocaine injections and recorded on WD35-WD49. AMPAR EPSCs in core and shell did not show inward rectification and were insensitive to 1-naphthylacetylspermine (a selective antagonist of CP-AMPARs). Locomotor sensitization could still be demonstrated after this long withdrawal period, although the upregulation of GluA1A2-containing AMPARs observed at earlier withdrawal times was no longer detected. In conclusion, in adult rats, accumulation of synaptic CP-AMPARs in the NAc occurs after prolonged  withdrawal from extended-access cocaine self-administration but not after prolonged withdrawal from noncontingent cocaine injections.", "21402948": "Dopamine (DA) is considered crucial for the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse,  but its role in addiction is much less clear. This review focuses on studies that used PET to characterize the brain DA system in addicted subjects. These studies  have corroborated in humans the relevance of drug-induced fast DA increases in striatum [including nucleus accumbens (NAc)] in their rewarding effects but have  unexpectedly shown that in addicted subjects, drug-induced DA increases (as well  as their subjective reinforcing effects) are markedly blunted compared with controls. In contrast, addicted subjects show significant DA increases in striatum in response to drug-conditioned cues that are associated with self-reports of drug craving and appear to be of a greater magnitude than the DA  responses to the drug. We postulate that the discrepancy between the expectation  for the drug effects (conditioned responses) and the blunted pharmacological effects maintains drug taking in an attempt to achieve the expected reward. Also, whether tested during early or protracted withdrawal, addicted subjects show lower levels of D2 receptors in striatum (including NAc), which are associated with decreases in baseline activity in frontal brain regions implicated in salience attribution (orbitofrontal cortex) and inhibitory control (anterior cingulate gyrus), whose disruption results in compulsivity and impulsivity. These results point to an imbalance between dopaminergic circuits that underlie reward  and conditioning and those that underlie executive function (emotional control and decision making), which we postulate contributes to the compulsive drug use and loss of control in addiction.", "21232547": "The neuroadaptation theory of addiction suggests that, similar to the development of most memories, exposure to drugs of abuse induces adaptive molecular and cellular changes in the brain which likely mediate addiction-related memories or  the addictive state. Compared to other types of memories, addiction-related memories develop fast and last extremely long, suggesting that the cellular and molecular processes that mediate addiction-related memories are exceptionally adept and efficient. We recently demonstrated that repeated exposure to cocaine generated a large portion of \"silent\" glutamatergic synapses within the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Silent glutamatergic synapses are synaptic connections in which  only N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR)-mediated responses are readily detected whereas alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) are absent or highly labile. Extensive experimental evidence suggests that silent synapses are conspicuously efficient plasticity sites at which long-lasting plastic changes can be more easily induced and maintained. Thus, generation of silent synapses can be regarded as a process of metaplasticity, which primes the NAc for subsequent durable and robust plasticity for addiction-related memories. Focusing on silent synapse-based metaplasticity,  this review discusses how key brain regions, such as the NAc, utilize the metaplasticity mechanism to optimize the plasticity machineries to achieve fast and durable plastic changes following exposure to cocaine. A summary of recent related results suggests that upon cocaine exposure, newly generated silent synapses may prime excitatory synapses within the NAc for long-term potentiation  (LTP), thus setting the direction of future plasticity. Furthermore, because cocaine-generated silent synapses are enriched in NMDARs containing the NR2B subunit, the enhanced NR2B-signaling may set up a selective recruitment of certain types of AMPARs. Thus, silent synapse-based metaplasticity may lead to not only quantitative but also qualitative alterations in excitatory synapses within the NAc. This review is one of the first systematic analyses regarding the hypothesis that drugs of abuse induce metaplasticity, which regulates the susceptibility, the direction, and the molecular details of subsequent plastic changes. Taken together, metaplasticity ultimately serves as a key step in mediating cascades of addiction-related plastic alterations.", "20188650": "Many excitatory synapses express Group 1, or Gq coupled, metabotropic glutamate receptors (Gp1 mGluRs) at the periphery of their postsynaptic density. Activation of Gp1 mGluRs typically occurs in response to strong activity and triggers long-term plasticity of synaptic transmission in many brain regions, including the neocortex, hippocampus, midbrain, striatum, and cerebellum. Here we focus on  mGluR-induced long-term synaptic depression (LTD) and review the literature that  implicates Gp1 mGluRs in the plasticity of behavior, learning, and memory. Moreover, recent studies investigating the molecular mechanisms of mGluR-LTD have discovered links to mental retardation, autism, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's  disease, and drug addiction. We discuss how mGluRs lead to plasticity of neural circuits and how the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of mGluR plasticity provides insight into brain disease.", "20055706": "The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are family C G-protein-coupled receptors that participate in the modulation of synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability throughout the central nervous system. The mGluRs bind glutamate within a large extracellular domain and transmit signals through the receptor protein to intracellular signaling partners. A great deal of progress has been made in determining the mechanisms by which mGluRs are activated, proteins with which they interact, and orthosteric and allosteric ligands that can modulate receptor activity. The widespread expression of mGluRs makes these receptors particularly attractive drug targets, and recent studies continue to validate the therapeutic utility of mGluR ligands in neurological and psychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, anxiety, depression,  and schizophrenia.", "19717140": "BACKGROUND: The cystine-glutamate exchanger is downregulated after chronic cocaine, resulting in reduced extracellular levels of nucleus accumbens glutamate. The importance of cocaine-induced loss of glutamate homeostasis is revealed by N-acetylcysteine restoring cystine-glutamate exchange and attenuating reinstatement to cocaine seeking. Another regulator of extracellular glutamate is the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1. We hypothesized that cocaine self-administration reduces GLT-1 and that GLT-1 upregulation inhibits cocaine seeking. METHODS: We measured [(3)H] glutamate uptake and protein expression of GLT-1 and  xCT, the catalytic subunit of the cystine-glutamate exchanger, following cocaine  self-administration and 3 weeks of extinction training. We also examined the affect of ceftriaxone (previously shown to increase GLT-1) and N-acetylcysteine treatment on the expression of GLT-1 and xCT. Ceftriaxone was also tested for the capacity to inhibit cue- and cocaine-induced relapse. RESULTS: Cocaine self-administration reduced glutamate uptake and the expression  of both GLT-1 and xCT. Ceftriaxone restored GLT-1 and xCT levels and prevented cue- and cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. N-acetylcysteine also restored GLT-1 and xCT levels. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that glutamate transport and cystine-glutamate exchange may be coregulated and provide further evidence that targeting glutamate homeostasis is a potential method for treating cocaine relapse.", "19607791": "Studies over the past decade have enunciated silent synapses as prominent cellular substrates for synaptic plasticity in the developing brain. However, little is known about whether silent synapses can be generated postdevelopmentally. Here, we demonstrate that highly salient in vivo experience, such as exposure to cocaine, generates silent synapses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell, a key brain region mediating addiction-related learning and memory.  Furthermore, this cocaine-induced generation of silent synapses is mediated by membrane insertions of new, NR2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs). These results provide evidence that silent synapses can be generated de novo by in vivo experience and thus may act as highly efficient neural substrates for the subsequent experience-dependent synaptic plasticity underlying extremely  long-lasting memory.", "19103434": "BACKGROUND: The present study determined if, akin to cocaine, nicotine self-administration in rats induces adaptations in the expression of glutamate transporters and cystine-glutamate exchangers in brain nuclei implicated in reinforcement and if treating cigarette smokers with a drug that restores cystine-glutamate exchange affects the number of cigarettes smoked. METHODS: Rats self-administered nicotine intravenously for 12 hours/day or received nicotine through osmotic minipumps for 21 days. Somatic signs of withdrawal were measured and immunoblotting was performed 12 hours after the last nicotine exposure to determine if the catalytic subunit of the cystine-glutamate  exchanger, xCT, or the glial glutamate transporter, GLT-1, were altered in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, or amygdala.  For the smoking reduction study in humans, nicotine-dependent smokers were treated for 4 weeks with N-acetylcysteine (2400 mg daily) to promote cystine-glutamate exchange or placebo. Participants provided weekly ratings of withdrawal symptoms, craving, and carbon monoxide (CO) measurements and logged daily cigarette and alcohol use. RESULTS: Rats receiving nicotine via self-administration or minipumps displayed somatic signs of withdrawal, but only nicotine self-administering rats showed decreased xCT expression in the nucleus accumbens and VTA and decreased GLT-1 expression in the nucleus accumbens. Human smokers treated with N-acetylcysteine  reported a reduction in cigarettes smoked, and there was no effect of N-acetylcysteine on estimates of CO levels, craving, or withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the cystine-glutamate exchanger and the  glial glutamate transporter are downregulated after nicotine self-administration, and augmenting exchanger activity with N-acetylcysteine reduced the number of cigarettes smoked in nicotine-dependent individuals.", "18854855": "Silent synapses abound in the young brain, representing an early step in the pathway of experience-dependent synaptic development. Discovered amidst the debate over whether long-term potentiation reflects a presynaptic or a postsynaptic modification, silent synapses--which in the hippocampal CA1 subfield are characterized by the presence of NMDA receptors but not AMPA receptors--have  stirred some mechanistic controversy of their own. Out of this literature has emerged a model for synapse unsilencing that highlights the central role for postsynaptic AMPA-receptor trafficking in the expression of excitatory synaptic plasticity.", "18640924": "Regulation of gene expression is considered a plausible mechanism of drug addiction, given the stability of behavioural abnormalities that define an addicted state. Among many transcription factors known to influence the addiction process, one of the best characterized is DeltaFosB, which is induced in the brain's reward regions by chronic exposure to virtually all drugs of abuse and mediates sensitized responses to drug exposure. Since DeltaFosB is a highly stable protein, it represents a mechanism by which drugs produce lasting changes  in gene expression long after the cessation of drug use. Studies are underway to  explore the detailed molecular mechanisms by which DeltaFosB regulates target genes and produces its behavioural effects. We are approaching this question using DNA expression arrays coupled with the analysis of chromatin remodelling--changes in the posttranslational modifications of histones at drug-regulated gene promoters--to identify genes that are regulated by drugs of abuse via the induction of DeltaFosB and to gain insight into the detailed molecular mechanisms involved. Our findings establish chromatin remodelling as an important regulatory mechanism underlying drug-induced behavioural plasticity, and promise to reveal fundamentally new insight into how DeltaFosB contributes to addiction by regulating the expression of specific target genes in brain reward pathways.", "17898233": "Although some studies report increased responsiveness of nucleus accumbens (NAc)  AMPA receptors (AMPARs) after withdrawal from repeated cocaine treatment, others  report decreased responsiveness after withdrawal plus cocaine challenge. Here we  examine this apparent contradiction by quantifying cell surface and intracellular AMPAR subunits in the NAc before and after a challenge injection in behaviorally  sensitized rats. Because MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) regulate AMPAR trafficking and are implicated in addiction, we also evaluated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38. Glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) and GluR2 surface/intracellular (S/I) ratios were increased after 14 d of withdrawal in sensitized rats but were decreased 24  h after challenge with cocaine (which elicited a sensitized locomotor response) or saline (which elicited conditioned locomotion). These findings suggested redistribution of GluR1/2-containing receptors, a possibility supported by immunoprecipitation experiments indicating that most AMPARs in the NAc are GluR1/2 or GluR2/3, with few homomeric GluR1 or GluR1/3 receptors. In sensitized  rats, ERK phosphorylation in the NAc increased during withdrawal and normalized after cocaine challenge. JNK phosphorylation also increased after withdrawal, but after cocaine challenge, it was inversely related to GluR1 and GluR2 S/I ratios.  After saline challenge, p38 phosphorylation was increased. In summary, surface expression of GluR1/2-containing AMPARs increased in the NAc of sensitized rats,  but AMPARs internalized after a single reexposure to cocaine or cocaine-related cues. ERK phosphorylation paralleled AMPAR surface expression. Although JNK results were complex, JNK and p38 may be involved in AMPAR internalization after  cocaine or saline challenge, respectively.", "17765204": "Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing disorder, characterized by an uncontrollable motivation to seek and use drugs. Converging clinical and preclinical observations implicate pathologies within the corticolimbic glutamate system in the genetic predisposition to, and the development of, an addicted phenotype. Such observations pose cellular factors regulating glutamate transmission as likely molecular candidates in the etiology of addiction. Members of the Homer family of proteins regulate signal transduction through, and the trafficking of, glutamate receptors, as well as maintain and regulate extracellular glutamate levels in corticolimbic brain regions. This review summarizes the existing data implicating the Homer family of protein in acute behavioral and neurochemical sensitivity to drugs of abuse, the development of drug-induced neuroplasticity, as well as other behavioral and cognitive pathologies associated with an addicted state.", "16520736": "Drugs of abuse cause activation of the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Expression of active CREB in rat NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs) increased their excitability, whereas dominant-negative CREB had the opposite effect. Decreasing excitability of NAc MSNs in vivo by overexpression of potassium channels enhanced locomotor responses to cocaine, suggesting that the increased NAc MSN excitability caused by CREB helped to limit behavioral sensitivity to cocaine.", "16251991": "Drug addiction is increasingly viewed as the endpoint of a series of transitions  from initial drug use--when a drug is voluntarily taken because it has reinforcing, often hedonic, effects--through loss of control over this behavior,  such that it becomes habitual and ultimately compulsive. Here we discuss evidence that these transitions depend on interactions between pavlovian and instrumental  learning processes. We hypothesize that the change from voluntary drug use to more habitual and compulsive drug use represents a transition at the neural level from prefrontal cortical to striatal control over drug seeking and drug taking behavior as well as a progression from ventral to more dorsal domains of the striatum, involving its dopaminergic innervation. These neural transitions may themselves depend on the neuroplasticity in both cortical and striatal structures that is induced by chronic self-administration of drugs.", "16160706": "Homer proteins modulate neuroplasticity in excitatory synapses and are dynamically regulated by cocaine. Whereas acute cocaine elevates immediate-early  gene (short) isoforms of Homer1 in the nucleus accumbens, withdrawal from repeated cocaine administration downregulates the expression of constitutive Homer1 isoforms. The present study determined whether or not this downregulation  in constitutive Homer expression in the accumbens is necessary for enduring alterations in cocaine-induced changes in the brain and behavior. The long vs short Homer isoforms were overexpressed in the rat nucleus accumbens during drug  abstinence, and the adaptations elicited by repeated cocaine on glutamate transmission and motor behavior were measured. It was found that both chronic and acute overexpression of constitutive, but not short, Homer isoforms abolished cocaine-induced sensitization of locomotor hyperactivity and prevented the development of glutamate abnormalities in the accumbens, including the reduction  in basal extracellular glutamate content and the sensitized glutamate response to a subsequent cocaine challenge injection. Together, these data indicate that the  enduring reduction of long Homer isoforms in the nucleus accumbens of cocaine-withdrawn rats is necessary for the expression of cocaine-induced neuroplasticity.", "15295029": "In the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key structure to the effects of all addictive drugs, presynaptic cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) and postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate 5 receptors (mGluR5s) are the principal effectors of endocannabinoid (eCB)-mediated retrograde long-term depression (LTD) (eCB-LTD) at the prefrontal cortex-NAc synapses. Both CB1R and mGluR5 are involved in cocaine-related behaviors; however, the impact of in vivo cocaine exposure on eCB-mediated retrograde synaptic plasticity remains unknown. Electrophysiological and biochemical approaches were used, and we report that a single in vivo cocaine administration abolishes eCB-LTD. This effect of cocaine was not present in D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) -/- mice and was prevented when cocaine was coadministered with the selective D1R antagonist 8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3-5-1h-3-benzazepin-7-ol (0.5 mg/kg) or with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) blocker (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (1 mg/kg), suggesting the involvement of D1R and NMDAR. We found that the cocaine-induced blockade of retrograde signaling was correlated with enhanced expression levels of Homer scaffolding proteins containing the coiled-coil domain and accompanied by a strong reduction of mGluR5 surface expression. The results suggest that cocaine-induced loss of eCB retrograde signaling is caused by a reduction in the ability of mGluR5 to translate anterograde glutamate transmission into retrograde eCB signaling.", "15146190": "Endogenous cannabinoids (eCB) mediate synaptic plasticity in brain regions involved in learning and reward. Here we show that in mice, a single in-vivo exposure to Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) abolishes the retrograde signaling that underlies eCB-mediated synaptic plasticity in both nucleus accumbens (NAc) and hippocampus in vitro. This effect is reversible within 3 days and is associated with a transient modification in the functional properties of cannabinoid receptors.", "12716962": "The relative contributions of glutamate and dopamine within the nucleus accumbens to cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior were assessed. When extinguished cocaine self-administration behavior was reinstated by a cocaine-priming injection, extracellular levels of both dopamine and glutamate were elevated in the nucleus accumbens. However, when yoked cocaine or saline control subjects were administered a cocaine prime, only dopamine levels were elevated. Thus, glutamate increased only when animals reinstated lever pressing,  whereas dopamine increased regardless of behavior. The increase in glutamate was  not accounted for simply by the act of lever pressing itself, because the cocaine self-administration group still demonstrated elevated glutamate when the levers were withdrawn from the operant chamber. Moreover, reinstatement of lever pressing for food did not elevate extracellular glutamate, indicating that increased glutamate initiated responding selectively for a drug reinforcement. The source of glutamate was shown to be glutamatergic afferents from the prefrontal cortex because inhibiting prefrontal cortical glutamatergic neurons that project to the accumbens prevented the rise in glutamate. Together, these data demonstrate that activation of a glutamatergic projection from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens underlies cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior.", "12060781": "Do endocannabinoids (eCBs) participate in long-term synaptic plasticity in the brain? Using pharmacological approaches and genetically altered mice, we show that stimulation of prelimbic cortex afferents at naturally occurring frequencies causes a long-term depression of nucleus accumbens glutamatergic synapses mediated by eCB release and presynaptic CB1 receptors. Translation of glutamate synaptic transmission into eCB retrograde signaling involved metabotropic glutamate receptors and postsynaptic intracellular Ca(2+) stores. These findings  unveil the role of the eCB system in activity-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity and identify a mechanism by which marijuana can alter synaptic functions in the endogenous brain reward system.", "10499584": "Acute exposure to cocaine transiently induces several Fos family transcription factors in the nucleus accumbens, a region of the brain that is important for addiction. In contrast, chronic exposure to cocaine does not induce these proteins, but instead causes the persistent expression of highly stable isoforms  of deltaFosB. deltaFosB is also induced in the nucleus accumbens by repeated exposure to other drugs of abuse, including amphetamine, morphine, nicotine and phencyclidine. The sustained accumulation of deltaFosB in the nucleus accumbens indicates that this transcription factor may mediate some of the persistent neural and behavioural plasticity that accompanies chronic drug exposure. Using transgenic mice in which deltaFosB can be induced in adults in the subset of nucleus accumbens neurons in which cocaine induces the protein, we show that deltaFosB expression increases the responsiveness of an animal to the rewarding and locomotor-activating effects of cocaine. These effects of deltaFosB appear to be mediated partly by induction of the AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole) glutamate receptor subunit GluR2 in  the nucleus accumbens. These results support a model in which deltaFosB, by altering gene expression, enhances sensitivity to cocaine and may thereby contribute to cocaine addiction.", "10415648": "Our knowledge of the organization of the nucleus accumbens has been greatly advanced in the last two decades, but only now are we beginning to understand the complex neural circuitry that underlies the mix of behaviors attributed to this nucleus. Superimposed on the neurochemically defined territories of the shell and core are four or more conduits for information flow. Each of these behaviorally relevant pathways can be characterized by the spatial distribution of inputs to its central unit: the GABAergic projection neuron, a spiny cell that also contains the opioid peptides, enkephalin or dynorphin. In this review, current models of accumbal circuits will be examined and, with the aid of recent anatomical findings, further extended to shed light on how functionally diverse information is processed in this nucleus. However complex, accumbal wiring is not fixed, and, as we will show, psychostimulants, dopamine-deleting lesions, and chronic blockade of dopaminergic receptors can alter the anatomical substrate, synaptology, and neurotrophic factors that govern circuits through the shell and  core.", "7908412": "The nucleus accumbens (NA), a ventral extension of the striatum, plays a role in  several complex behaviour patterns and also is a major site of action of drugs of abuse such as cocaine. Intrinsic NA cells are predominantly quiescent and their activity depends on excitatory input from cortical and subcortical limbic afferents. Here we examine the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity at the synapse between prelimbic cortical afferents and cells in the core region of the NA. Manipulations that induce a Ca(2+)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of non-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)-receptor-mediated responses also produce a simultaneous long-term depression (LTD) of NMDA-receptor-mediated responses. These results indicate that in a single cell the same change in postsynaptic Ca2+ concentration can have opposite effects on non-NMDA- and NMDA-receptor-mediated synaptic responses. This may be particularly important in the NA, where NMDA receptors are critical for mediating the behavioural actions of drugs of abuse.", "18341995": "The mesocorticolimbic dopamine system is essential for cognitive and emotive brain functions and is thus an important target in major brain diseases like schizophrenia, drug addiction, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the cellular basis for the diversity in behavioral functions and associated dopamine-release pattern within the mesocorticolimbic system has remained unclear. Here, we report the identification of a type of dopaminergic neuron within the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system with unconventional fast-firing properties and small DAT/TH mRNA expression ratios that selectively projects to prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens core and medial shell as well as to basolateral amygdala. In contrast, well-described conventional slow-firing  dopamine midbrain neurons only project to the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens and the dorsolateral striatum. Among this dual dopamine midbrain system defined in this study by converging anatomical, electrophysiological, and molecular properties, mesoprefrontal dopaminergic neurons are unique, as only they do not possess functional somatodendritic Girk2-coupled dopamine D2 autoreceptors.", "17888555": "Procedures have been developed which provide extremely stable patterns of cocaine self-administration in rats and these have been useful in lesion and drug pretreatment studies aimed at understanding the neurobiology of cocaine reinforcement. The issue now is whether studying the neurobiology of reinforcement is the same as studying the neurobiology of addiction. If the goal  is to understand a progressive and deteriorating disorder, then the self-administration procedures should model specific aspects of the progressive stages of the addiction process. Here we review theoretical strategies for modeling the addiction process and present data from a series of experiments from our laboratory showing conditions which produce a progressive change in the motivation to self-administer cocaine in rats. This phenomenon is revealed by an  escalation in breakpoints on a progressive ratio schedule. The effect, which is robust and persistent, depends on dose and speed of injection. Interestingly, high drug intake can retard the development of this effect, which we argue indicates that the addiction process has a developmental sequence. Finally, we suggest that specific parameters (dose, price and availability) can be used to examine the transition from recreational use to binge-like intake.", "17400299": "There are several brain regions that have been implicated in the control of motivated behavior and whose disruption leads to the pathophysiology observed in  major psychiatric disorders. These systems include the ventral hippocampus, which is involved in context and focus on tasks, the amygdala, which mediates emotional behavior, and the prefrontal cortex, which modulates activity throughout the limbic system to enable behavioral flexibility. Each of these systems has overlapping projections to the nucleus accumbens, where these inputs are integrated under the modulatory influence of dopamine.

Here, we report that  behaviors that resemble three of the essential diagnostic criteria for addiction  appear over time in rats trained to self-administer cocaine. As in humans, this addiction-like behavior is present only in a small proportion of subjects using cocaine and is highly predictive of relapse after withdrawal. These findings provide a new basis for developing a true understanding and treatment of addiction.", "27822508": "Clozapine N-oxide (CNO) is a ligand for a powerful chemogenetic system that can selectively inhibit or activate neurons; the so-called Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) system. This system consists of  synthetic G-protein-coupled receptors, which are not believed to be activated by  any endogenous ligand, but are activated by the otherwise inert CNO. However, it  has previously been shown that the administration of CNO in humans and rats leads to detectable levels of the bioactive compounds clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine (N-Des). As a follow-up, experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of CNO in male Long-Evans rats. It was found that 1 mg/kg CNO reduced the acoustic startle reflex but had no effect on prepulse inhibition  (PPI; a measure of sensorimotor gating). CNO (2 and 5 mg/kg) had no effect on the disruption to PPI induced by the NMDA antagonist phencyclidine or the muscarinic  antagonist scopolamine. In locomotor studies, CNO alone (at 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg) had no effect on spontaneous locomotion, but 5 mg/kg CNO pretreatment significantly attenuated d-amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion. In line with the  behavioral results, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry found that 5 mg/kg CNO significantly attenuated the d-amphetamine-induced increase in evoked dopamine. However, the effects seen after CNO administration cannot be definitively ascribed to CNO because biologically relevant levels of clozapine and N-Des were  found in plasma after CNO injection. Our results show that CNO has multiple dose-dependent effects in vivo and is converted to clozapine and N-Des emphasizing the need for a CNO-only DREADD-free control group when designing DREADD-based experiments.", "11425919": "Several studies have shown that the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is strongly influenced by the ventral subiculum (vSub) of the hippocampus. To examine whether this occurs by activation of DA neuron firing, the effects of chemical stimulation of the vSub on ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neuron activity were examined using extracellular single-unit recordings. Infusions of NMDA into the vSub increased the number of spontaneously firing DA cells recorded per electrode track, while having no effect on firing rate or burst firing. This response was abolished by intranucleus accumbens (NAc) infusions of the glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid. This effect did not involve the prefrontal cortex, because infusions of tetrodotoxin into the prefrontal cortex did not affect the increase in spontaneously active DA cells. Infusions of either kynurenic acid into the NAc or tetrodotoxin into the vSub decreased the firing rate and burst firing of DA neurons without altering the number of spontaneously active DA neurons. These data show that glutamatergic afferents from the vSub to the NAc exert a potent excitatory effect on VTA DA neurons, influencing both DA neuron population activity and the regulation of the firing properties of these neurons. As a result, dysfunctions in hippocampal circuitries may contribute to the hyperexcitable state of the DA system that is present in schizophrenia.", "24973197": "Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) is a behavioral procedure in which operant responding is maintained by pulses of electrical brain stimulation. In research to study abuse-related drug effects, ICSS relies on electrode placements that target the medial forebrain bundle at the level of the lateral hypothalamus, and  experimental sessions manipulate frequency or amplitude of stimulation to engender a wide range of baseline response rates or response probabilities. Under these conditions, drug-induced increases in low rates/probabilities of responding maintained by low frequencies/amplitudes of stimulation are interpreted as an abuse-related effect. Conversely, drug-induced decreases in high rates/probabilities of responding maintained by high frequencies/amplitudes of stimulation can be interpreted as an abuse-limiting effect. Overall abuse potential can be inferred from the relative expression of abuse-related and abuse-limiting effects. The sensitivity and selectivity of ICSS to detect abuse potential of many classes of abused drugs is similar to the sensitivity and selectivity of drug self-administration procedures. Moreover, similar to progressive-ratio drug self-administration procedures, ICSS data can be used to rank the relative abuse potential of different drugs. Strengths of ICSS in comparison with drug self-administration include 1) potential for simultaneous evaluation of both abuse-related and abuse-limiting effects, 2) flexibility for use with various routes of drug administration or drug vehicles, 3) utility for studies in drug-naive subjects as well as in subjects with controlled levels of prior drug exposure, and 4) utility for studies of drug time course. Taken together, these considerations suggest that ICSS can make significant contributions to the practice of abuse potential testing.", "22445345": "The activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons promotes behavioral responses to rewards and environmental stimuli that predict them. VTA  GABA inputs synapse directly onto DA neurons and may regulate DA neuronal activity to alter reward-related behaviors; however, the functional consequences  of selective activation of VTA GABA neurons remains unknown. Here, we show that in\u00a0vivo optogenetic activation of VTA GABA neurons disrupts reward consummatory behavior but not conditioned anticipatory behavior in response to reward-predictive cues. In addition, direct activation of VTA GABA projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) resulted in detectable GABA release but did not alter reward consumption. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of VTA GABA neurons directly suppressed the activity and excitability of neighboring DA neurons as well as the release of DA in the NAc, suggesting that the dynamic interplay between VTA DA and GABA neurons can control the initiation and termination of reward-related behaviors.", "22128031": "Central glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor activation reduces food intake;  however, brain nuclei and mechanism(s) mediating this effect remain poorly understood. Although central nervous system GLP-1 is produced almost exclusively  in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the hindbrain, GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) are expressed throughout the brain, including nuclei in the mesolimbic reward system (MRS), e.g. the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Here, we examine the MRS as a potential site of action for GLP-1-mediated  control of food intake and body weight. Double immunohistochemistry for Fluorogold (monosynaptic retrograde tracer) and GLP-1 neuron immunoreactivity indicated that GLP-1-producing nucleus tractus solitarius neurons project directly to the VTA, the NAc core, and the NAc shell. Pharmacological data showed that GLP-1R activation in the VTA, NAc core, and NAc shell decreased food intake, especially of highly-palatable foods, and body weight. Moreover, blockade of endogenous GLP-1R signaling in the VTA and NAc core resulted in a significant increase in food intake, establishing a physiological relevance for GLP-1 signaling in the MRS. Current data highlight these nuclei within the MRS as novel sites for GLP-1R-mediated control of food intake and body weight.", "18784289": "Synaptic plasticity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) has been implicated in the acquisition of a drug-dependent state. Even a single exposure to cocaine in naive animals is sufficient to trigger sustained changes on VTA glutamatergic synapses that resemble activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in other brain regions. However, an insight into its time course and mechanisms of action  is limited. Here, we show that cocaine acts locally within the VTA to induce an LTP-like enhancement of AMPA receptor-mediated transmission that is not detectable minutes after drug exposure but is fully expressed within 3 h. This cocaine-induced LTP appears to be mediated via dopamine D(5) receptor activation  of NMDA receptors and to require protein synthesis. Increased levels of high-conductance GluR1-containing AMPA receptors at synapses are evident at 3 h after cocaine exposure. Furthermore, our data suggest that cocaine-induced LTP might share the same molecular substrates for expression with activity-dependent  LTP induced in the VTA by a spike-timing-dependent (STD) protocol, because we observed that STD LTP is significantly reduced or not inducible in VTA neurons previously exposed to cocaine in vivo or in vitro.", "17105338": "Author information:  (1)Department of Basic Neurosciences and Clinic of Neurology, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland. christian.luscher@medecine.unige.ch", "8628395": "Disruption of the mouse dopamine transporter gene results in spontaneous hyperlocomotion despite major adaptive changes, such as decreases in neurotransmitter and receptor levels. In homozygote mice, dopamine persists at least 100 times longer in the extracellular space, explaining the biochemical basis of the hyperdopaminergic phenotype and demonstrating the critical role of the transporter in regulating neurotransmission. The dopamine transporter is an obligatory target of cocaine and amphetamine, as these psychostimulants have no effect on locomotor activity or dopamine release and uptake in mice lacking the transporter.", "26019323": "One of the major challenges of cocaine addiction is the high rate of relapse to drug use after periods of withdrawal. During the first few weeks of withdrawal, cue-induced cocaine craving intensifies, or \"incubates,\" and persists over extended periods of time. Although several brain regions and molecular mechanisms were found to be involved in this process, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms are still unknown. Herein, we used a rat model of incubation of cocaine craving,  in which rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.75 mg/kg, 6 h/d, 10 d),  and cue-induced cocaine-seeking was examined in an extinction test after 1 or 30  d of withdrawal. We show that the withdrawal periods, as well as cue-induced cocaine seeking, are associated with broad, time-dependent enhancement of DNA methylation alterations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). These gene methylation alterations were partly negatively correlated with gene expression changes. Furthermore, intra-NAc injections of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (RG108, 100 \u03bcm) abolished cue-induced cocaine seeking on day 30, an effect that persisted 1 month, whereas the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (500 \u03bcm) had an opposite effect on cocaine seeking. We then targeted two proteins whose genes were demethylated by RG108-estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). Treatment with an intra-NAc injection of the ESR1 agonist propyl pyrazole triol (10 nm) or the CDK5 inhibitor roscovitine (28 \u03bcm) on day 30 of withdrawal significantly decreased cue-induced cocaine seeking. These results demonstrate a  role for NAc DNA methylation, and downstream targets of DNA demethylation, in incubation of cocaine craving.", "20729844": "Despite abundant expression of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) in brain, the regulation and behavioral role of DNA methylation remain poorly understood. We found that Dnmt3a expression was regulated in mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) by chronic cocaine use and chronic social defeat stress. Moreover, NAc-specific manipulations that block DNA methylation potentiated cocaine reward and exerted antidepressant-like effects, whereas NAc-specific Dnmt3a overexpression attenuated cocaine reward and was pro-depressant. On a cellular level, we found that chronic cocaine use selectively increased thin dendritic spines on NAc neurons and that DNA methylation was both necessary and sufficient to mediate these effects. These data establish the importance of Dnmt3a in the NAc in regulating cellular and behavioral plasticity to emotional stimuli.", "12535933": "Repeated exposure to cocaine produces an enduring increase in dendritic spine density in adult rat nucleus accumbens. It has been shown previously that chronic cocaine administration increases the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase-5 in this brain region and that this neuronal protein kinase regulates cocaine-induced locomotor activity. Moreover, cyclin-dependent kinase-5 has been implicated in neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. Therefore, we studied the involvement  of this enzyme in cocaine's effect on dendritic spine density. Adult male rats, receiving intra-accumbens infusion of the cyclin-dependent kinase-5 inhibitor roscovitine or saline, were administered a 28-day cocaine treatment regimen. Animals were killed 24-48 h after the final cocaine injection and their brains removed and processed for Golgi-Cox impregnation. Our findings demonstrate that roscovitine attenuates cocaine-induced dendritic spine outgrowth in nucleus accumbens core and shell and such inhibition reduces spine density in nucleus accumbens shell of control animals. These data indicate that cyclin-dependent kinase-5 is involved in regulation of, as well as cocaine-induced changes in, dendritic spine density.", "9218268": "This paper is a critique of fixed and progressive ratio schedules used to examine the neural substrates of cocaine reinforcement. The discussion focuses on problems encountered while examining the effects of neurotoxic lesions and pharmacological pretreatments on cocaine reinforcement. We review the theoretical and interpretational problems associated with the use of the fixed ratio (FR) schedules that have been used in the majority of studies, and we conclude that rate of drug intake cannot directly address the issue of increased or decreased reinforcer efficacy. The progressive ratio (PR) schedule offers some advantages over FR schedules, although it is now clear that the same implementation cannot be applied across all drug classes. It is likely that the motivation to self-administer psychostimulant vs. opiate drugs is qualitatively different. We conclude that there is no single schedule that can quantify all aspects of drug reinforcement and that behavioral paradigms will need to be adapted according to  the particular question under study.", "27534877": "Humans and animals such as rats and mice tend to overconsume calorie-dense foods, a phenomenon that likely contributes to obesity. One often-advanced explanation for why we preferentially consume sweet and fatty foods is that they are more \"rewarding\" than low-calorie foods. \"Reward\" has been subdivided into three interdependent psychological processes: hedonia (liking a food), reinforcement (formation of associations among stimuli, actions, and/or the food), and motivation (wanting the food). Research into these processes has focused on the mesolimbic system, which comprises both dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and neurons in their major projection target, the nucleus accumbens. The mesolimbic system and closely connected structures are commonly referred to as the brain's \"reward circuit.\" Implicit in this title is the assumption that \"rewarding\" experiences are generally the result of activity in this circuit. In  this review, I argue that food intake and the preference for calorie-dense foods  can be explained without reference to subjective emotions. Furthermore, the contribution of mesolimbic dopamine to food intake and preference may not be a general one of promoting or coordinating behaviors that result in the most reward or caloric intake but may instead be limited to the facilitation of a specific form of neural computation that results in conditioned approach behavior. Studies on the neural mechanisms of caloric intake regulation must address how sensory information about calorie intake affects not just the mesolimbic system but also  many other forms of computation that govern other types of food-seeking and food-oriented behaviors.", "27240658": "Environmental reward-predictive cues can motivate reward-seeking behaviors. Although this influence is normally adaptive, it can become maladaptive in disordered states, such as addiction. Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core (NAc) is known to mediate the motivational impact of reward-predictive cues, but little is known about how other neuromodulatory systems contribute to cue-motivated behavior. Here, we examined the role of the NAc cholinergic receptor system in cue-motivated behavior using a Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer task designed to assess the motivating influence of a reward-predictive  cue over an independently-trained instrumental action. Disruption of NAc muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activity attenuated, whereas blockade of nicotinic receptors augmented cue-induced invigoration of reward seeking. We next examined a potential dopaminergic mechanism for this behavioral effect by combining fast-scan cyclic voltammetry with local pharmacological acetylcholine receptor manipulation. The data show evidence of opposing modulation of cue-evoked dopamine release, with muscarinic and nicotinic receptor antagonists causing suppression and augmentation, respectively, consistent with the behavioral effects of these manipulations. In addition to demonstrating cholinergic modulation of naturally-evoked and behaviorally-relevant dopamine signaling, these data suggest that NAc cholinergic receptors may gate the expression of cue-motivated behavior through modulation of phasic dopamine release.", "26290234": "Mesolimbic dopamine (DA) is phasically released during appetitive behaviors, though there is substantive disagreement about the specific purpose of these DA signals. For example, prediction error (PE) models suggest a role of learning, while incentive salience (IS) models argue that the DA signal imbues stimuli with value and thereby stimulates motivated behavior. However, within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) patterns of DA release can strikingly differ between subregions,  and as such, it is possible that these patterns differentially contribute to aspects of PE and IS. To assess this, we measured DA release in subregions of the NAc during a behavioral task that spatiotemporally separated sequential goal-directed stimuli. Electrochemical methods were used to measure subsecond NAc dopamine release in the core and shell during a well learned instrumental chain schedule in which rats were trained to press one lever (seeking; SL) to gain access to a second lever (taking; TL) linked with food delivery, and again during extinction. In the core, phasic DA release was greatest following initial SL presentation, but minimal for the subsequent TL and reward events. In contrast, phasic shell DA showed robust release at all task events. Signaling decreased between the beginning and end of sessions in the shell, but not core. During extinction, peak DA release in the core showed a graded decrease for the SL and pauses in release during omitted expected rewards, whereas shell DA release decreased predominantly during the TL. These release dynamics suggest parallel DA signals capable of supporting distinct theories of appetitive behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Dopamine signaling in the brain is important for a variety of cognitive functions, such as learning and motivation. Typically, it  is assumed that a single dopamine signal is sufficient to support these cognitive functions, though competing theories disagree on how dopamine contributes to reward-based behaviors. Here, we have found that real-time dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens (a primary target of midbrain dopamine neurons) strikingly varies between core and shell subregions. In the core, dopamine dynamics are consistent with learning-based theories (such as reward prediction error) whereas in the shell, dopamine is consistent with motivation-based theories (e.g., incentive salience). These findings demonstrate that dopamine plays multiple and complementary roles based on discrete circuits that help animals optimize rewarding behaviors.", "25319709": "Both animals and humans often prefer rewarding options that are nearby over those that are distant, but the neural mechanisms underlying this bias are unclear. Here we present evidence that a proximity signal encoded by neurons in the nucleus accumbens drives proximate reward bias by promoting impulsive approach to nearby reward-associated objects. On a novel decision-making task, rats chose the nearer option even when it resulted in greater effort expenditure and delay to reward; therefore, proximate reward bias was unlikely to be caused by effort or delay discounting. The activity of individual neurons in the nucleus accumbens did not consistently encode the reward or effort associated with specific alternatives, suggesting that it does not participate in weighing the values of options. In contrast, proximity encoding was consistent and did not depend on the subsequent choice, implying that accumbens activity drives approach to the nearest rewarding option regardless of its specific associated reward size or effort level.", "23724077": "Neurons in the ventral striatum (VS) fire to cues that predict differently valued rewards. It is unclear whether this activity represents the value associated with the expected reward or the level of motivation induced by reward anticipation. To distinguish between the two, we trained rats on a task in which we varied value independently from motivation by manipulating the size of the reward expected on  correct trials and the threat of punishment expected upon errors. We found that separate populations of neurons in VS encode expected value and motivation.", "23303055": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) serves as an integral node within cortico-limbic circuitry that regulates various forms of cost-benefit decision making. The dopamine (DA) system has also been implicated in enabling organisms to overcome a variety of costs to obtain more valuable rewards. However, it remains unclear how DA activity within the NAc may regulate decision making involving reward uncertainty. This study investigated the contribution of different DA receptor subtypes in the NAc to risk-based decision making, assessed with a probabilistic  discounting task. In well-trained rats, D1 receptor blockade with SCH 23,390 decreased preference for larger, uncertain rewards, which was associated with enhanced negative-feedback sensitivity (ie, an increased tendency to select a smaller/certain option after an unrewarded risky choice). Treatment with a D1 agonist (SKF 81,297) optimized decision making, increasing choice of the risky option when reward probability was high, and decreasing preference under low probability conditions. In stark contrast, neither blockade of NAc D2 receptors with eticlopride, nor stimulation of these receptors with quinpirole or bromocriptine influenced risky choice. In comparison, infusion of the D3-preferring agonist PD 128,907 decreased reward sensitivity and risky choice. Collectively, these results show that mesoaccumbens DA refines risk-reward decision biases via dissociable mechanisms recruiting D1 and D3, but not D2 receptors. D1 receptor activity mitigates the effect of reward omissions on subsequent choices to promote selection of reward options that may have greater long-term utility, whereas excessive D3 receptor activity blunts the impact that  larger/uncertain rewards have in promoting riskier choices.", "22323717": "The ventral striatum (VS) is thought to signal the predicted value of expected outcomes. However, it is still unclear whether VS can encode value independently  from variables often yoked to value such as response direction and latency. Expectations of high value reward are often associated with a particular action and faster latencies. To address this issue we trained rats to perform a task in  which the size of the predicted reward was signaled before the instrumental response was instructed. Instrumental directional cues were presented briefly at  a variable onset to reduce accuracy and increase reaction time. Rats were more accurate and slower when a large versus small reward was at stake. We found that  activity in VS was high during odors that predicted large reward even though reaction times were slower under these conditions. In addition to these effects,  we found that activity before the reward predicting cue reflected past and predicted reward. These results demonstrate that VS can encode value independent  of motor contingencies and that the role of VS in goal-directed behavior is not just to increase vigor of specific actions when more is at stake.", "22158514": "Neostriatal cholinergic interneurons are believed to be important for reinforcement-mediated learning and response selection by signaling the occurrence and motivational value of behaviorally relevant stimuli through precisely timed multiphasic population responses. An important problem is to understand how these signals regulate the functioning of the neostriatum. Here we describe the synaptic organization of a previously unknown circuit that involves  direct nicotinic excitation of several classes of GABAergic interneurons, including neuroptide Y-expressing neurogilaform neurons, and enables cholinergic  interneurons to exert rapid inhibitory control of the activity of projection neurons. We also found that, in vivo, the dominant effect of an optogenetically reproduced pause-excitation population response of cholinergic interneurons was powerful and rapid inhibition of the firing of projection neurons that is coincident with synchronous cholinergic activation. These results reveal a previously unknown circuit mechanism that transmits reinforcement-related information of ChAT interneurons in the mouse neostriatal network.", "21147998": "Dopamine released in the nucleus accumbens is thought to contribute to the decision to exert effort to seek reward. This hypothesis is supported by findings that performance of tasks requiring higher levels of effort is more susceptible to disruption by manipulations that reduce accumbens dopamine function than tasks that require less effort. However, performance of some low-effort cue-responding  tasks is highly dependent on accumbens dopamine. To reconcile these disparate results, we made detailed behavioral observations of rats performing various operant tasks and determined how injection of dopamine receptor antagonists into  the accumbens influenced specific aspects of the animals' behavior. Strikingly, once animals began a chain of operant responses, the antagonists did not affect the ability to continue the chain until reward delivery. Instead, when rats left  the operandum, the antagonists severely impaired the ability to return. We show that this impairment is specific to situations in which the animal must determine a new set of approach actions on each approach occasion; this behavior is called  \"flexible approach.\" Both high-effort operant tasks and some low-effort cue-responding tasks require dopamine receptor activation in the accumbens because animals pause their responding and explore the chamber, and accumbens dopamine is required to terminate these pauses with flexible approach to the operandum. The flexible approach hypothesis provides a unified framework for understanding the contribution of the accumbens and its dopamine projection to reward-seeking behavior.", "20696383": "Basal ganglia circuits are essential for the organization and execution of voluntary actions. Within the striatum, fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are thought to tightly regulate the activity of medium-spiny projection neurons (MSNs) through feed-forward inhibition, yet few studies have investigated the functional contributions of FSIs in behaving animals. We recorded presumed MSNs and FSIs together with motor cortex and globus pallidus (GP) neurons, in rats performing a simple choice task. MSN activity was widely distributed across the task sequence, especially near reward receipt. By contrast, FSIs showed a coordinated pulse of increased activity as chosen actions were initiated, in conjunction with a sharp decrease in GP activity. Both MSNs and FSIs were direction selective, but neighboring MSNs and FSIs showed opposite selectivity. Our findings suggest that individual FSIs participate in local striatal information processing, but more global disinhibition of FSIs by GP is important  for initiating chosen actions while suppressing unwanted alternatives.", "20364878": "The authors investigated the contribution of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell to effort-based decision making using a discounting procedure. Selection of 1 lever delivered a smaller, 2-pellet reward immediately, whereas the other lever delivered a 4-pellet reward after a fixed ratio of presses (2, 5, 10, or 20) that increased over 4 blocks of 10 discrete choice trials. Subsequent testing employed an equivalent delays procedure, whereby the relative delay to reward delivery after selection of either option was equalized. In well-trained rats, inactivation of the core, but not the shell, via infusion of GABA A/B agonists muscimol/baclofen reduced preference for the high-effort option under standard conditions and also when rats were tested using an equivalent delays procedure. However, inactivation of the core did not alter preference for 4-pellet versus 2-pellet rewards when the relative costs of each option were the same (1 press).  Thus, the NAc core, but not the shell, appears to be part of a neural circuit that biases choice toward larger rewards associated with a greater effort cost. Furthermore, the contributions by the NAc core to this form of decision making can be dissociated from its role in delay discounting.", "15245497": "Discriminative stimuli (DSs) inform animals that reward can be obtained contingent on the performance of a specific behavior. Such stimuli reinstate drug-seeking behavior, evoke dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and  excite and inhibit specific subpopulations of NAc neurons. Here we show in rats that DSs can reinstate food-seeking behavior. In addition, we compare the effects of injecting dopamine receptor antagonists into the NAc with those of general NAc inactivation on the performance of a DS task. Selective antagonism of D1 receptors reduced responding to the DS and increased the latency to respond, whereas general inactivation of NAc neuronal activity increased the latency to respond to the DS and increased behaviors extraneous to the task, such as responding in the absence of cues and responding on the inactive lever. Based on  these results and our previous findings that NAc neuronal responses to DSs are dependent on the ventral tegmental area, we propose a model for the functional role of NAc neurons in controlling behavioral responses to reward-predictive stimuli.", "15159167": "Concepts of motivation are vital to progress in behavioral neuroscience. Motivational concepts help us to understand what limbic brain systems are chiefly evolved to do, i.e., to mediate psychological processes that guide real behavior. This article evaluates some major motivation concepts that have historic importance or have influenced the interpretation of behavioral neuroscience research. These concepts include homeostasis, setpoints and settling points, intervening variables, hydraulic drives, drive reduction, appetitive and consummatory behavior, opponent processes, hedonic reactions, incentive motivation, drive centers, dedicated drive neurons (and drive neuropeptides and receptors), neural hierarchies, and new concepts from affective neuroscience such as allostasis, cognitive incentives, and reward 'liking' versus 'wanting'.", "14645378": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays an important role in both appetitive and consummatory behavior. To examine how NAc neurons encode information during reward consumption, we recorded the firing activity of rat NAc neurons during the performance of a discriminative stimulus task. In this task, the animal must make an operant response to an intermittently presented cue to obtain a sucrose reward delivered in a reward receptacle. Uncued entries to the receptacle were not rewarded. Both excitations and inhibitions during reward consumption were observed, but substantially more neurons were inhibited than excited. These excitations and inhibitions began when the animal entered the reward receptacle and ended when the animal exited the receptacle. Both excitations and inhibitions were much smaller or nonexistent when the animal made uncued entries into the reward receptacle. In one set of experiments, we randomly withheld the reward in  some cued trials that would otherwise have been rewarded. Excitations and inhibitions were of similar magnitude whether or not the reward was delivered. This indicates that the sensory stimulus of reward does not drive these phasic responses; instead, the reward-associated responses may be driven by the conditioned stimuli associated with reward, or they may encode information about  consummatory motor activity. Another population of NAc neurons was excited on exit from the reward receptacle. Many of these excitations persisted for tens of  seconds after the receptacle exit and showed a significant inverse correlation with the rate of uncued operant responding. These findings are consistent with a  contribution of NAc neurons to both reward consummatory and reward seeking behavior.", "14645377": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has long been thought of as a limbic-motor interface. Despite behavioral and anatomical evidence in favor of this idea, little is known about how NAc neurons encode information about motivationally relevant environmental cues and use this information to affect motor action. We therefore  investigated the firing of these neurons during the performance of a discriminative stimulus (DS) task using simultaneous multiple single-unit recordings in rats. In this task, two stimuli are randomly presented to the animal: a DS, which signals the availability of a sucrose reward contingent on an operant response, and a similar but nonrewarded stimulus (NS). Subpopulations of  NAc neurons increased or decreased their firing in association with several distinct components of the task. In this paper, we investigate cue- and operant-responsive neurons. Neurons excited and inhibited by cues showed larger firing changes in response to the DS than the NS and larger changes when the animal made an operant response to the cue than when the animal failed to respond. Excitations during operant responding were not modulated by the information contained by the cue, whereas inhibitions during operant responding were somewhat larger if the operant response occurred during the DS and somewhat  smaller if they occurred in the absence of a cue. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the firing of subpopulations of NAc neurons encode both  the predictive value of environmental stimuli and the specific motor behaviors required to respond to them.", "12034134": "Emotions are multifaceted, but a key aspect of emotion involves the assessment of the value of environmental stimuli. This article reviews the many psychological representations, including representations of stimulus value, which are formed in the brain during Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning tasks. These representations may be related directly to the functions of cortical and subcortical neural structures. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) appears to be required for a Pavlovian conditioned stimulus (CS) to gain access to the current  value of the specific unconditioned stimulus (US) that it predicts, while the central nucleus of the amygdala acts as a controller of brainstem arousal and response systems, and subserves some forms of stimulus-response Pavlovian conditioning. The nucleus accumbens, which appears not to be required for knowledge of the contingency between instrumental actions and their outcomes, nevertheless influences instrumental behaviour strongly by allowing Pavlovian CSs to affect the level of instrumental responding (Pavlovian-instrumental transfer), and is required for the normal ability of animals to choose rewards that are delayed. The prelimbic cortex is required for the detection of instrumental action-outcome contingencies, while insular cortex may allow rats to retrieve the values of specific foods via their sensory properties. The orbitofrontal cortex,  like the BLA, may represent aspects of reinforcer value that govern instrumental  choice behaviour. Finally, the anterior cingulate cortex, implicated in human disorders of emotion and attention, may have multiple roles in responding to the  emotional significance of stimuli and to errors in performance, preventing responding to inappropriate stimuli.", "24005296": "Accumbal deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of addiction. Here, we demonstrate that DBS in the nucleus accumbens shell, but not the core, attenuates cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking, an animal model of relapse, in male Sprague Dawley rats. Next, we compared DBS of the shell with pharmacological inactivation. Results indicated that inactivation using reagents that influenced (lidocaine) or spared (GABA receptor agonists) fibers of passage blocked cocaine reinstatement when administered into the core but not the shell. It seems unlikely, therefore, that  intrashell DBS influences cocaine reinstatement by inactivating this nucleus or the fibers coursing through it. To examine potential circuit-wide changes, c-Fos  immunohistochemistry was used to examine neuronal activation following DBS of the nucleus accumbens shell. Intrashell DBS increased c-Fos induction at the site of  stimulation as well as in the infralimbic cortex, but had no effect on the dorsal striatum, prelimbic cortex, or ventral pallidum. Recent evidence indicates that accumbens DBS antidromically stimulates axon terminals, which ultimately activates GABAergic interneurons in cortical areas that send afferents to the shell. To test this hypothesis, GABA receptor agonists (baclofen/muscimol) were microinjected into the anterior cingulate, and prelimbic or infralimbic cortices  before cocaine reinstatement. Pharmacological inactivation of all three medial prefrontal cortical subregions attenuated the reinstatement of cocaine seeking. These results are consistent with DBS of the accumbens shell attenuating cocaine  reinstatement via local activation and/or activation of GABAergic interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex via antidromic stimulation of cortico-accumbal afferents.", "23616522": "Hedonic overconsumption contributing to obesity involves altered activation within the mesolimbic dopamine system. Dysregulation of dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAS) has been implicated in reward-seeking behaviors, such as binge eating, which contributes to treatment resistance in obesity (Wise, 2012). Direct modulation of the NAS with deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical procedure currently under investigation in humans for the treatment of major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and addiction, may also be effective in ameliorating binge eating. Therefore, we examined the ability of DBS of the NAS to block this behavior in mice. c-Fos immunoreactivity was assessed as a marker of DBS-mediated neuronal activation. NAS DBS was found to reduce binge eating and increased c-Fos levels in this region. DBS of the dorsal striatum had  no influence on this behavior, demonstrating anatomical specificity for this effect. The dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, raclopride, attenuated the action of DBS, whereas the D1 receptor antagonist, SCH-23390, was ineffective, suggesting that dopamine signaling involving D2 receptors underlies the effect of NAS DBS. To determine the potential translational relevance to the obese state, chronic NAS DBS was also examined in diet-induced obese mice and was found to acutely reduce caloric intake and induce weight loss. Together, these findings support the involvement of the mesolimbic dopamine pathways in the hedonic mechanisms contributing to obesity, and the efficacy of NAS DBS to modulate this system.", "21658580": "Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are not homogeneous but differ in their molecular  properties and responses to external stimuli. We examined whether the modulation  of excitatory synapses on DA neurons by rewarding or aversive stimuli depends on  the brain area to which these DA neurons project. We identified DA neuron subpopulations in slices after injection of \"Retrobeads\" into single target areas of adult mice and found differences in basal synaptic properties. Administration  of cocaine selectively modified excitatory synapses on DA cells projecting to nucleus accumbens (NAc) medial shell while an aversive stimulus selectively modified synapses on DA cells projecting to medial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, synapses on DA neurons projecting to NAc lateral shell were modified by both rewarding and aversive stimuli, which presumably reflects saliency. These results suggest that the mesocorticolimbic DA system may be comprised of three anatomically distinct circuits, each modified by distinct aspects of motivationally relevant stimuli.", "18490925": "Psychiatric neurosurgery teams in the United States and Europe have studied deep  brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule and  adjacent ventral striatum (VC/VS) for severe and highly treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder. Four groups have collaborated most closely, in small-scale studies, over the past 8 years. First to begin was Leuven/Antwerp, followed by Butler Hospital/Brown Medical School, the Cleveland Clinic and most recently the University of Florida. These centers used comparable patient selection criteria and surgical targeting. Targeting, but not selection, evolved  during this period. Here, we present combined long-term results of those studies, which reveal clinically significant symptom reductions and functional improvement in about two-thirds of patients. DBS was well tolerated overall and adverse effects were overwhelmingly transient. Results generally improved for patients implanted more recently, suggesting a 'learning curve' both within and across centers. This is well known from the development of DBS for movement disorders. The main factor accounting for these gains appears to be the refinement of the implantation site. Initially, an anterior-posterior location based on anterior capsulotomy lesions was used. In an attempt to improve results, more posterior sites were investigated resulting in the current target, at the junction of the anterior capsule, anterior commissure and posterior ventral striatum. Clinical results suggest that neural networks relevant to therapeutic improvement might be modulated more effectively at a more posterior target. Taken together, these data show that the procedure can be successfully implemented by dedicated interdisciplinary teams, and support its therapeutic promise.", "16899732": "The anterior cingulate and orbital cortices and the ventral striatum process different aspects of reward evaluation, whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum are involved in cognitive function. Collectively,  these areas are critical to decision making. We mapped the striatal area that receives information about reward evaluation. We also explored the extent to which terminals from reward-related cortical areas converge in the striatum with  those from cognitive regions. Using three-dimensional-rendered reconstructions of corticostriatal projection fields along with two-dimensional chartings, we demonstrate the reward and cognitive territories in the primate striatum and show the convergence between these cortical inputs. The results show two labeling patterns: a focal projection field that consists of densely distributed terminal  patches, and a diffuse projection consisting of clusters of fibers, extending throughout a wide area of the striatum. Together, these projection fields demonstrate a remarkably large, rostral, reward-related striatal territory that reaches into the dorsal striatum. Fibers from different reward-processing and cognitive cortical areas occupy both separate and converging territories. Furthermore, the diffuse projection may serve a separate integrative function by  broadly disseminating general cortical activity. These findings show that the rostral striatum is in a unique position to mediate different aspects of incentive learning. Furthermore, areas of convergence may be particularly sensitive to dopamine modulation during decision making and habit formation.", "16530430": "In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex  on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a  mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies  of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in  which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.", "15501092": "The techniques available for the interrogation and analysis of neuroimaging data  have a large influence in determining the flexibility, sensitivity, and scope of  neuroimaging experiments.

In this paper, we present a review of the research carried out by the Analysis Group at the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB). This research has focussed on the development of new methodologies for the analysis of both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. The majority of the research laid out in this paper has been implemented as freely available software tools within FMRIB's Software Library (FSL).", "11832223": "We present a technique for automatically assigning a neuroanatomical label to each voxel in an MRI volume based on probabilistic information automatically estimated from a manually labeled training set. In contrast to existing segmentation procedures that only label a small number of tissue classes, the current method assigns one of 37 labels to each voxel, including left and right caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, lateral ventricles, hippocampus, and amygdala. The classification technique employs a registration procedure that is robust to anatomical variability, including the ventricular enlargement typically associated with neurological diseases and aging. The technique is shown to be comparable in accuracy to manual labeling, and of sufficient sensitivity to robustly detect changes in the volume of noncortical structures that presage the  onset of probable Alzheimer's disease.", "11050134": "Amphetamine microinjection into the nucleus accumbens shell enhanced the ability  of a Pavlovian reward cue to trigger increased instrumental performance for sucrose reward in a pure conditioned incentive paradigm. Rats were first trained  to press one of two levers to obtain sucrose pellets. They were separately conditioned to associate a Pavlovian cue (30 sec light) with free sucrose pellets. On test days, the rats received bilateral microinjection of intra-accumbens vehicle or amphetamine (0.0, 2.0, 10.0, or 20.0 microgram/0.5 microliter), and lever pressing was tested in the absence of any reinforcement contingency, while the Pavlovian cue alone was freely presented at intervals throughout the session. Amphetamine microinjection selectively potentiated the cue-elicited increase in sucrose-associated lever pressing, although instrumental responding was not reinforced by either sucrose or the cue during the test. Intra-accumbens amphetamine can therefore potentiate cue-triggered incentive motivation for reward in the absence of primary or secondary reinforcement. Using the taste reactivity measure of hedonic impact, it was shown that intra-accumbens amphetamine failed to increase positive hedonic reaction patterns elicited by sucrose (i.e., sucrose \"liking\") at doses that effectively increase sucrose \"wanting.\" We conclude that nucleus accumbens dopamine specifically mediates the  ability of reward cues to trigger \"wanting\" (incentive salience) for their associated rewards, independent of both hedonic impact and response reinforcement.", "10415646": "The nucleus accumbens, a major part of the ventral striatum, comprises numerous subterritories and compartments, of which the core and shell appear to be dominant. Shell exhibits greater chemical neuroanatomical diversity than core and is rather directly connected to it by a robust, feed-forward, striatopallido-thalamocortico-striatal pathway. Shell and extended amygdala share afferents, but the two are distinguished by their outputs, strongly toward cortex for shell and descendent toward brain stem effector sites for extended amygdala.  Shell responds independently to stimulation by excitatory amino acids and dopamine, which are more mutually permissive in the core. Accordingly, the shell  responds to a broad variety of physiological and pharmacological stimuli, including psychomotor and opioid drugs. Whereas locomotion and oro-facial movements are elicitable from the shell, lesions and blockade of EAA transmission in the core reduce locomotion. It is hypothesized that core-shell has a feed-forward functional organization.", "8951872": "Changes in opioid neurotransmission have been implicated in several basal ganglia-related neurological and psychiatric disorders. To gain a better insight  into the opioid receptor distribution in the normal human striatum, we examined in post mortem brain the distribution of the mu opioid receptor using ligand binding of [3H]O-ala2-N-methyl-phe4, gly-ol5-enkephalin. Our results indicate at  the regional level the presence of a dorsal-to-ventral high-to-low density gradient in the striatum, with lowest densities in the ventral one-third of the putamen and in the nucleus accumbens. At the subregional level, the nucleus accumbens shows two major types of heterogeneities. First, low vs intermediate binding densities distinguish the core and shell subdivisions, respectively. The  low-density core and intermediate-density shell regions extend into the putamen and are therefore characteristic for the entire ventral striatum. The second type of heterogeneity is formed by small areas located along the ventral contours of the nucleus accumbens and putamen that display the highest binding density of the entire striatum. Since these areas can also be recognized in the distribution patterns of other markers and in the cytoarchitecture, they appear to possess a separate identity. To emphasize their special neurochemical characteristics we propose the description \"neurochemically unique domains in the accumbens and putamen\". The present results, with the difference between core and shell of the  ventral striatum as the most prominent outcome, together with the notion that the connectional relationships and neurochemical organization of the striatum are very heterogeneous, suggest a strong regional functional differentiation for mu receptor function in the human striatum.", "8742307": "The neurochemical division of the rodent nucleus accumbens into shell and core is now a widely accepted concept. However, such divisions in the primate nucleus accumbens have yet to be fully clarified and described. In the present study, the forebrains of three primates--marmoset, rhesus monkey, and human--and a Wistar rat, were immunoreacted with antibodies directed against calbindin-D28k. The patterns of immunoreactivity in the primates' ventral striatum were mapped and compared to that of rat. Calbindin staining was uneven in all species and there was no evidence of a bicompartmental organization, i.e., striosome/patch and matrix, in central parts of the nucleus. Nucleus accumbens in primates, as in rat, could be divided immunohistochemically into a crescent-shaped outer shell--medially, ventrally and laterally--and an inner core. In general, medial parts of the shell stained less intensely for calbindin than did lateral parts. However, interspecific variation in the intensity of the immunoreactive staining  and the mediolateral extent of the shell was obvious. The core, which immunostained unevenly, was consistently more intensely immunoreactive than either medial or lateral shell in all species except the marmoset. These results  suggest that the neurochemical subdivisions of shell and core established for nucleus accumbens of rodents are also present in primates. However, further work  is needed to establish whether these territories are homologous and, if so, the full extent of that homology.", "22956836": "Forming place-reward associations critically depends on the integrity of the hippocampal-ventral striatal system. The ventral striatum (VS) receives a strong  hippocampal input conveying spatial-contextual information, but it is unclear how this structure integrates this information to invigorate reward-directed behavior. Neuronal ensembles in rat hippocampus (HC) and VS were simultaneously recorded during a conditioning task in which navigation depended on path integration. In contrast to HC, ventral striatal neurons showed low spatial selectivity, but rather coded behavioral task phases toward reaching goal sites.  Outcome-predicting cues induced a remapping of firing patterns in the HC, consistent with its role in episodic memory. VS remapped in conjunction with the  HC, indicating that remapping can take place in multiple brain regions engaged in the same task. Subsets of ventral striatal neurons showed a \"flip\" from high activity when cue lights were illuminated to low activity in intertrial intervals, or vice versa. The cues induced an increase in spatial information transmission and sparsity in both structures. These effects were paralleled by an enhanced temporal specificity of ensemble coding and a more accurate reconstruction of the animal's position from population firing patterns. Altogether, the results reveal strong differences in spatial processing between hippocampal area CA1 and VS, but indicate similarities in how discrete cues impact on this processing.", "21889806": "The hippocampal formation and striatum subserve declarative and procedural memory, respectively. However, experimental evidence suggests that the ventral striatum, as opposed to the dorsal striatum, does not lend itself to being part of either system. Instead, it may constitute a system integrating inputs from the amygdala, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus to generate motivational, outcome-predicting signals that invigorate goal-directed behaviors. Inspired by reinforcement learning models, we suggest an alternative scheme for computational functions of the striatum. Dorsal and ventral striatum are proposed to compute outcome predictions largely in parallel, using different types of information as  input. The nature of the inputs to striatum is furthermore combinatorial, and the specificity of predictions transcends the level of scalar value signals, incorporating episodic information.", "9030646": "The hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the ventral striatum form interconnected neural circuits that may underlie aspects of spatial cognition and memory. In the present series of experiments, we investigated functional interactions between these areas in rats during the performance of delayed and nondelayed spatially cued radial-arm maze tasks. The two-phase delayed task consisted of a training phase that provided rats with information about where food would be located on the maze 30 min later during a test phase. The single-phase nondelayed task was identical to the test phase of the delayed task, but in the absence of a training phase rats lacked previous knowledge of the location of food on the maze. Transient inactivation of the ventral CA1/subiculum (vSub) by a bilateral injection of lidocaine disrupted performance on both tasks. Lidocaine injections into the vSub on one side of the brain and the prefrontal cortex on the other transiently disconnected these two brain regions and significantly impaired foraging during the delayed task but not the nondelayed task. Transient disconnections between the vSub and the nucleus accumbens produced the opposite effect, disrupting foraging during the nondelayed task but  not during the delayed task. These data suggest that serial transmission of information between the vSub and the prefrontal cortex is required when trial-unique, short-term memory is used to guide prospective search behavior. In  contrast, exploratory goal-directed locomotion in a novel situation not requiring previously acquired information about the location of food is dependent on serial transmission between the hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens. These results indicate that different aspects of spatially mediated behavior are subserved by separate, distributed limbic-cortical-striatal networks.", "8308171": "Recent data have emphasized the neurochemically distinct nature of subterritories in the accumbens part of the rat ventral striatum termed the core, shell, and rostral pole. In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of how afferents are distributed relative to these subterritories, immunohistochemical detection of retrogradely transported Fluoro-Gold was carried out following iontophoretic injections intended to involve selectively one of the subterritories. The data revealed that a number of cortical afferents of the medial shell and core originate in separate areas, i.e., the dorsal peduncular, infralimbic, and posterior piriform cortices (to medial shell) and the dorsal prelimbic, anterior agranular insular, anterior cingulate, and perirhinal cortices (to core). The lateral shell and rostral pole are innervated by cortical structures that also project either to the medial shell or core. The orbital, posterior agranular insular, and entorhinal cortices, hippocampus, and basal amygdala were observed to innervate the accumbens in a topographic manner. Following core injections, strong bilateral cortical labeling was observed. Few labeled cortical cells were observed contralaterally following injections in the  medial shell. Intermediate numbers of labeled neurons were observed in contralateral cortices following lateral shell injections. Robust subcortical labeling in a variety of structures in the ventral forebrain, lateral hypothalamus, deep temporal lobe, and brainstem was observed after shell injections, particularly those that involved the caudal dorsomedial extremity of  the shell, i.e., its \"septal pole.\" Selective ipsilateral labeling of subcortical structures in the basal ganglia circuitry was observed following injections in the core and, to a lesser extent, lateral shell. It was concluded that a number of afferent systems exhibit varying degrees of segregation with respect to the accumbal subterritories.", "21389985": "Anxiety--a sustained state of heightened apprehension in the absence of immediate threat--becomes severely debilitating in disease states. Anxiety disorders represent the most common of psychiatric diseases (28% lifetime prevalence) and contribute to the aetiology of major depression and substance abuse. Although it  has been proposed that the amygdala, a brain region important for emotional processing, has a role in anxiety, the neural mechanisms that control anxiety remain unclear. Here we explore the neural circuits underlying anxiety-related behaviours by using optogenetics with two-photon microscopy, anxiety assays in freely moving mice, and electrophysiology. With the capability of optogenetics to control not only cell types but also specific connections between cells, we observed that temporally precise optogenetic stimulation of basolateral amygdala  (BLA) terminals in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA)--achieved by viral transduction of the BLA with a codon-optimized channelrhodopsin followed by restricted illumination in the downstream CeA--exerted an acute, reversible anxiolytic effect. Conversely, selective optogenetic inhibition of the same projection with a third-generation halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) increased anxiety-related behaviours. Importantly, these effects were not observed with direct optogenetic control of BLA somata, possibly owing to recruitment of antagonistic downstream structures. Together, these results implicate specific BLA-CeA projections as critical circuit elements for acute anxiety control in the mammalian brain, and demonstrate the importance of optogenetically targeting defined projections, beyond simply targeting cell types, in the study of circuit  function relevant to neuropsychiatric disease.", "17360345": "We evolved muscarinic receptors in yeast to generate a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are activated solely by a pharmacologically inert drug-like and bioavailable compound (clozapine-N-oxide).  Subsequent screening in human cell lines facilitated the creation of a family of  muscarinic acetylcholine GPCRs suitable for in vitro and in situ studies. We subsequently created lines of telomerase-immortalized human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells stably expressing all five family members and found that each one faithfully recapitulated the signaling phenotype of the parent receptor. We also expressed a G(i)-coupled designer receptor in hippocampal neurons (hM(4)D) and demonstrated its ability to induce membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal silencing. We have thus devised a facile approach for designing families of GPCRs with engineered ligand specificities. Such reverse-engineered GPCRs will prove to be powerful tools for selectively modulating signal-transduction pathways in vitro and in vivo.", "25529632": "The prefrontal cortex plays an important role in shaping cognition and behavior.  Many studies have shown that medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in  seeking, extinction, and reinstatement of cocaine seeking in rodent models of relapse. Subregions of mPFC appear to play distinct roles in these behaviors, such that the prelimbic cortex (PL) is proposed to drive cocaine seeking and the  infralimbic cortex (IL) is proposed to suppress cocaine seeking after extinction. This dichotomy of mPFC function may be a general attribute, as similar dorsal-ventral distinctions exist for expression vs. extinction of fear conditioning. However, other results indicate that the role of mPFC neurons in reward processing is more complex than a simple PL-seek vs. IL-extinguish dichotomy. Both PL and IL have been shown to drive and inhibit drug seeking (and  other types of behaviors) depending on a range of factors including the behavioral context, the drug-history of the animal, and the type of drug investigated. This heterogeneity of findings may reflect multiple subcircuits within each of these PFC areas supporting unique functions. It may also reflect the fact that the mPFC plays a multifaceted role in shaping cognition and behavior, including those overlapping with cocaine seeking and extinction. Here we discuss research leading to the hypothesis that dorsal and ventral mPFC differentially control drug seeking and extinction. We also present recent results calling the absolute nature of a PL vs. IL dichotomy into question. Finally, we consider alternate functions for mPFC that correspond less to response execution and inhibition and instead incorporate the complex cognitive behavior for which the mPFC is broadly appreciated.", "22823160": "Inhibitory optogenetics was used to examine the roles of the prelimbic cortex (PL), the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) and the PL projections to the NAcore in the reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Rats were microinjected into the PL or NAcore with an adeno-associated virus containing halorhodopsin or archaerhodopsin. After 12 days of cocaine self-administration, followed by extinction training, animals underwent reinstatement testing along with the presence/absence of optically induced inhibition via laser light. Bilateral optical inhibition of the PL, NAcore or the PL fibers in the NAcore inhibited the reinstatement of cocaine seeking.", "11923456": "One of the major determinants of reinstatement to cocaine use among human addicts is acute reexposure to the drug, which often precipitates cocaine craving and relapse. We used an animal model of cocaine relapse to determine the role of the  glutamatergic pathway from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to the nucleus accumbens in the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior after a cocaine priming injection. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine intravenously on  a second order schedule. Responding was extinguished subsequently by substituting saline for cocaine. During subsequent reinstatement sessions, drug-seeking behavior was assessed after noncontingent priming injections. Results indicated that reinstatement induced by a systemic cocaine injection was blocked by intra-mPFC administration of the dopamine antagonist flupenthixol. Consistent with this finding, administration of cocaine directly into the mPFC reinstated cocaine-seeking behavior. Administration of cocaine into the nucleus accumbens also reinstated drug seeking, whereas microinjection of cocaine into the neostriatum or lateral septum did not. Reinstatement of cocaine seeking induced by intra-mPFC cocaine was blocked by administration of the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX into the nucleus accumbens. Administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 into the nucleus accumbens had variable effects on reinstatement  induced by intra-mPFC cocaine in that AP-5 had no effect in some animals but augmented reinstatement in others. Subsequent experiments showed that intra-accumbal microinjection of AP-5 alone dose-dependently reinstated cocaine seeking. These data indicate that the glutamatergic pathway from the mPFC to the  nucleus accumbens plays an important role in cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. Moreover, the present results demonstrate that AMPA and NMDA receptors in the nucleus accumbens have opposing roles in the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior.", "11606653": "The role of limbic-striato-pallidal circuitry in cocaine-induced reinstatement was evaluated. The transient inhibition of brain nuclei associated with motor systems [including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), dorsal prefrontal cortex (dPFC), core of the nucleus accumbens (NAcore), and ventral pallidum (VP)] prevented cocaine-induced reinstatement. However, only the VP proved to be necessary for food reinstatement, suggesting that the identified circuit is specific to drug-related reinstatement. Supporting the possibility that the VTA-dPFC-NAcore-VP is a series circuit mediating reinstatement, simultaneous unilateral microinjection of GABA agonists into the dPFC in one hemisphere and into the VP in the contralateral hemisphere abolished cocaine reinstatement. Although dopamine projections from the VTA innervate all three forebrain nuclei,  the blockade of dopamine receptors only in the dPFC antagonized cocaine-induced reinstatement. Furthermore, DA administration into the dPFC was sufficient to elicit a reinstatement in drug-related responding. These data demonstrate that dopamine release in the dPFC initiates a dPFC-NAcore-VP series circuit that mediates cocaine-induced drug-seeking behavior.", "9892292": "OBJECTIVE: Since signals for cocaine induce limbic brain activation in animals and cocaine craving in humans, the objective of this study was to test whether limbic activation occurs during cue-induced craving in humans. METHOD: Using positron emission tomography, the researchers measured relative regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in limbic and comparison brain regions of 14 detoxified male cocaine users and six cocaine-naive comparison subjects during exposure to both non-drug-related and cocaine-related videos and during resting baseline conditions. RESULTS: During the cocaine video, the cocaine users experienced craving and showed a pattern of increases in limbic (amygdala and anterior cingulate) CBF and decreases in basal ganglia CBF relative to their responses to the non-drug video. This pattern did not occur in the cocaine-naive comparison subjects, and the two  groups did not differ in their responses in the comparison regions (i.e., the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, and visual cortex). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that limbic activation is one component of cue-induced cocaine craving. Limbic activation may be similarly involved in appetitive craving for other drugs and for natural rewards.", "2592611": "The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the topographical organization of efferent projections from the cytoarchitectonic divisions of the  mPFC (the medial precentral, dorsal anterior cingulate and prelimbic cortices). We also sought to determine whether the efferents from different regions within the prelimbic division were organized topographically. Anterograde transport of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was used to examine the efferent projections from restricted injection sites within the mPFC. Major targets of the prelimbic area were found to include prefrontal, cingulate, and perirhinal cortical structures, the dorsomedial and ventral striatum, basal forebrain nuclei, basolateral amygdala, lateral hypothalamus, mediodorsal, midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, periaqueductal gray region, ventral midbrain tegmentum, laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, and raphe nuclei. Previously unreported projections of the prelimbic region were also observed, including efferents to the anterior olfactory nucleus, the piriform cortex, and the pedunculopontine tegmental-cuneiform region. A topographical organization governed the efferent projections from the prelimbic area, such that the position of terminal fields within target structures was determined by the rostrocaudal, dorsoventral, and mediolateral placement of the injection sites. Efferent projections from the medial precentral and dorsal anterior cingulate divisions (dorsomedial PFC) were  organized in a similar topographical fashion and produced a pattern of anterograde labeling different from that seen with prelimbic injection sites. Target structures innervated primarily by the dorsomedial PFC included certain neocortical fields (the motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices), the dorsolateral striatum, superior colliculus, deep mesencephalic nucleus, and the pontine and medullary reticular formation. Previously unreported projections to the paraoculomotor central gray area and the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus were observed following dorsomedial PFC injections. These results indicate that the efferent projections of the mPFC are topographically organized within and across the cytoarchitectonic divisions of the medial wall cortex. The significance of topographically organized and restricted projections of the rat mPFC is discussed in light of behavioral and physiological studies indicating functional heterogeneity of this region.", "26598422": "The transition from casual to compulsive drug use is thought to occur as a consequence of repeated drug taking leading to neuroadaptive changes in brain circuitry involved in emotion and cognition. At the basis of such neuroadaptations lie changes in the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) implicated in transcriptional regulation, synaptic plasticity and intracellular signalling. However, little is known about how IEG expression patterns change during long-term drug self-administration. The present study, therefore, compares the effects of 10 and 60-day self-administration of cocaine and sucrose on the expression of 17 IEGs in brain regions implicated in addictive behaviour, i.e. dorsal striatum, ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Increased  expression after cocaine self-administration was found for 6 IEGs in dorsal and ventral striatum (c-fos, Mkp1, Fosb/\u0394Fosb, Egr2, Egr4, and Arc) and 10 IEGs in mPFC (same 6 IEGs as in striatum, plus Bdnf, Homer1, Sgk1 and Rgs2). Five of these 10 IEGs (Egr2, Fosb/\u0394Fosb, Bdnf, Homer1 and Jun) and Trkb in mPFC were responsive to long-term sucrose self-administration. Importantly, no major differences were found between IEG expression patterns after 10 or 60\u2009days of cocaine self-administration, except Fosb/\u0394Fosb in dorsal striatum and Egr2 in mPFC, whereas the amount of cocaine obtained per session was comparable for short-term and long-term self-administration. These steady changes in IEG expression are, therefore, associated with stable self-administration behaviour rather than the total amount of cocaine consumed. Thus, sustained impulses to IEG regulation during prolonged cocaine self-administration may evoke neuroplastic changes underlying compulsive drug use.", "25697160": "Exposure to drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, leads to plastic changes in the activity of brain circuits, and a prevailing view is that these changes play a part in drug addiction. Notably, there has been intense focus on drug-induced changes in synaptic excitability and much less attention on intrinsic excitability factors (that is, excitability factors that are remote from the synapse). Accumulating evidence now suggests that intrinsic factors such as K+ channels are not only altered by cocaine but may also contribute to the shaping of the addiction phenotype.", "25446457": "Learned associations between drugs and environment play an important role in addiction and are thought to be encoded within specific patterns of sparsely distributed neurons called neuronal ensembles. This hypothesis is supported by correlational data from in vivo electrophysiology and cellular imaging studies in relapse models in rodents. In particular, cellular imaging with the immediate early gene c-fos and its protein product Fos has been used to identify sparsely distributed neurons that were strongly activated during conditioned drug behaviors such as drug self-administration and context- and cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. Here we review how Fos and the c-fos promoter have been employed to demonstrate causal roles for Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles in prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens in conditioned drug behaviors. This work has allowed identification of unique molecular and electrophysiological alterations within Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles that may contribute to the development and expression of learned associations in addiction.", "24114427": "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: There is evidence that cue-induced sucrose seeking progressively increases after cessation of oral sucrose self-administration (incubation of sucrose craving) in both adolescent and adult rats. The synaptic plasticity changes associated with this incubation at different age groups are unknown. We assessed whether incubation of sucrose craving in rats trained to self-administer sucrose as young adolescents, adolescents, or adults is associated with changes in 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)propanoic  acid (AMPA)/N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) ratio (a measure of postsynaptic changes  in synaptic strength) in nucleus accumbens. METHODS: Three age groups initiated oral sucrose self-administration training (10 days) on postnatal day (P) 35 (young adolescents), P42 (adolescents), or P70 (adults). They were then tested for cue-induced sucrose seeking (assessed in an extinction test) on abstinence days 1 and 21. Separate groups of rats were trained to self-administer sucrose or water (a control condition), and assessed for AMPA/NMDA ratio in nucleus accumbens on abstinence days 1-3 and 21. RESULTS: Adult rats earned more sucrose rewards, but sucrose intake per body weight was higher in young adolescent rats. Time-dependent increases in cue-induced sucrose seeking (incubation of sucrose craving) were more pronounced  in adult rats, less pronounced in adolescents, and not detected in young adolescents. On abstinence day 21, but not days 1-3, AMPA/NMDA ratio in nucleus accumbens were decreased in rats that self-administered sucrose as adults and adolescents, but not young adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate age-dependent changes in magnitude of incubation of sucrose craving and nucleus accumbens synaptic plasticity after cessation of sucrose self-administration.", "24088811": "Correlational data suggest that learned associations are encoded within neuronal  ensembles. However, it has been difficult to prove that neuronal ensembles mediate learned behaviours because traditional pharmacological and lesion methods, and even newer cell type-specific methods, affect both activated and non-activated neurons. In addition, previous studies on synaptic and molecular alterations induced by learning did not distinguish between behaviourally activated and non-activated neurons. Here, we describe three new approaches--Daun02 inactivation, FACS sorting of activated neurons and Fos-GFP transgenic rats--that have been used to selectively target and study activated neuronal ensembles in models of conditioned drug effects and relapse. We also describe two new tools--Fos-tTA transgenic mice and inactivation of CREB-overexpressing neurons--that have been used to study the role of neuronal ensembles in conditioned fear.", "23023294": "Cocaine-induced alterations in synaptic glutamate function in nucleus accumbens are thought to mediate drug-related behaviors such as psychomotor sensitization.  However, previous studies have examined global alterations in randomly selected accumbens neurons regardless of their activation state during cocaine-induced behavior. We recently found that a minority of strongly activated Fos-expressing  accumbens neurons are necessary for cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization, whereas the majority of accumbens neurons are less directly involved. We assessed synaptic alterations in these strongly activated accumbens neurons in Fos-GFP mice, which express a fusion protein of Fos and GFP in strongly activated neurons, and compared these alterations with those in surrounding non-activated neurons. Cocaine sensitization produced higher levels of 'silent synapses', which contained functional NMDA receptors and nonfunctional AMPA receptors only in GFP-positive neurons, 6-11 d after sensitization. Thus, distinct synaptic alterations are induced in the most strongly activated accumbens neurons that mediate psychomotor sensitization.", "22261383": "Mesolimbic dopamine projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have been implicated in goal-directed behaviors for natural rewards and in learning processes involving cue-reward associations. The NAc has been traditionally subdivided into two anatomically distinct sub-regions with different functional properties: the shell and the core. The aim of the present study was to characterize rapid dopamine transmission across the two NAc sub-regions during cue-signaled operant behavior for a natural (sucrose) reward in rats. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) we observed differences in the magnitude and  dynamics of dopamine release events between the shell and core. Specifically, although cue-evoked dopamine release was observed in both sub-regions, it was larger and longer lasting in the shell compared with the core. Further, secondary dopamine release events were observed following the lever press response for sucrose in the NAc shell, but not the core. These findings demonstrate that the NAc displays regional specificity in dopamine transmission patterns during cued operant behavior for natural reward.", "21044174": "Although it has long been hypothesized that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) acts as an interface between limbic and motor regions, direct evidence for this modulatory role on behavior is lacking. Using a disconnection procedure in rats,  we found that basolateral amygdala (BLA) input to the core and medial shell of the NAc separately mediate two distinct incentive processes controlling the performance of goal-directed instrumental actions, respectively: (i) the sensitivity of instrumental responding to changes in the experienced value of the goal or outcome, produced by specific satiety-induced outcome devaluation; and (ii) the effect of reward-related cues on action selection, observed in outcome-specific Pavlovian-instrumental transfer. These results reveal, therefore, that dissociable neural circuits involving BLA inputs to the NAc core  and medial shell mediate distinct components of the incentive motivational processes controlling choice and decision-making in instrumental conditioning.", "19620976": "Learned associations between effects of abused drugs and the drug administration  environment are important in drug addiction. Histochemical and electrophysiological studies suggest that these associations are encoded in sparsely distributed nucleus accumbens neurons that are selectively activated by  drugs and drug-associated cues. Although correlations have been observed between  nucleus accumbens neuronal activity and responsivity to drugs and drug cues, no technique exists for selectively manipulating these activated neurons and establishing their causal role in behavioral effects of drugs and drug cues. Here we describe a new approach, which we term the 'Daun02 inactivation method', that  selectively inactivates a minority of neurons previously activated by cocaine in  an environment repeatedly paired with cocaine to demonstrate a causal role for these activated neurons in context-specific cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization in rats. This method provides a new tool for studying the causal roles of selectively activated neurons in behavioral effects of drugs and drug cues and in other learned behaviors.", "18667156": "Persistent drug-seeking behavior is hypothesized to co-opt the brain's natural reward-motivational system. Although ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons represent a crucial component of this system, the synaptic adaptations underlying natural rewards and drug-related motivation have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that self-administration of cocaine, but not passive cocaine infusions, produced a persistent potentiation of VTA excitatory synapses, which was still present after 3 months abstinence. Further, enhanced synaptic function in VTA was evident even after 3 weeks of extinction training. Food or sucrose self-administration induced only a transient potentiation of VTA glutamatergic signaling. Our data show that synaptic function in VTA DA neurons is readily but reversibly enhanced by natural reward-seeking behavior, while voluntary cocaine self-administration induced a persistent synaptic enhancement that is resistant to behavioral extinction. Such persistent synaptic potentiation in VTA DA neurons may represent a fundamental cellular phenomenon driving pathological drug-seeking behavior.", "16255002": "We elaborate herein a novel theory of basal ganglia function that accounts for why palatable, energy-dense foods retain high incentive value even when immediate physiological energy requirements have been met. Basal ganglia function has been  studied from the perspective of topographical segregation of processing within parallel circuits, with primary focus on motor control and cognition. Recent findings suggest, however, that the striatum can act as an integrated unit to modulate motivational state. We describe evidence that the striatal enkephalin system, which regulates the hedonic impact of preferred foods, undergoes coordinated gene expression changes that track current motivational state with regard to food intake. Striatal enkephalin gene expression is also downregulated  by an intrastriatal infusion of a cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, a manipulation that greatly suppresses food intake. To account for these findings,  we propose that signaling through a hypothalamic-midline thalamic-striatal axis impinges on the cholinergic interneurons of the striatum, which via their large,  overlapping axonal fields act as a network to modulate enkephalin-containing striatal output neurons. A key relay in this circuit is the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, which receives convergent input from orexin-coded hypothalamic  energy-sensing and behavioral state-regulating neurons, as well as from circadian oscillators, and projects to cholinergic interneurons throughout the striatal complex. We hypothesize that this system evolved to coordinate feeding and arousal, and to prolong the feeding central motivational state beyond the fulfillment of acute energy needs, thereby promoting \"overeating\" and the consequent development of an energy reserve for potential future food shortages.", "12574402": "Using a rat model of drug craving, we found that the responsiveness to cocaine cues progressively increases or incubates over the first 60 d of cocaine withdrawal. Here we studied whether alterations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels within the mesolimbic dopamine system are associated with this incubation phenomenon. BDNF is involved in synaptic plasticity and was  found to enhance responding for cues associated with natural rewards. Rats were trained to press a lever to receive intravenous cocaine or oral sucrose for 6 hr/d for 10 d; each earned reward was paired with a tone-light cue. Resumption of lever-pressing behavior was then assessed on days 1, 30, or 90 of reward withdrawal. First, resistance to extinction was assessed during 6 hr in which lever presses were not reinforced and the cue was absent. Second, cue-induced reinstatement was assessed after extinction during 1 hr in which responding led to cue presentations. Other rats were killed without testing on days 1, 30, and 90 of reward withdrawal, and BDNF and nerve growth factor (NGF) protein levels were measured in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), accumbens, and amygdala. Lever pressing during extinction and cue-induced reinstatement tests of cocaine craving progressively increased after cocaine withdrawal. Time-dependent changes also were observed during the tests for sucrose craving, with maximal responding on day 30. BDNF, but not NGF, levels in the VTA, accumbens, and amygdala progressively increased after cocaine, but not sucrose, withdrawal. Time-dependent increases in BDNF levels may lead to synaptic modifications that underlie enhanced responsiveness to cocaine cues after prolonged withdrawal periods.", "10818162": "Electrophysiological recording procedures were used to examine nucleus accumbens  (Acb) cell firing in rats trained to press a lever on a multiple schedule [ fixed ratio (FR)1, FR1] for either two \"natural\" reinforcers (food and water), or a natural reinforcer and intravenous self-administration of cocaine. Of 180 cells recorded during water and food reinforcement (n = 13 rats), 77 neurons were classified as phasically active, exhibiting one of three well-defined types of patterned discharges relative to the reinforced-response (Carelli and Deadwyler,  1994). Of the 77 phasic cells, the majority (68%) showed similar types of patterned discharges across the two natural reinforcer conditions. In contrast, of 127 neurons recorded during water and cocaine reinforcement (n = 8 rats), only 5 of 60 phasically active cells (8%) exhibited similar types of patterned discharges relative to water- and cocaine-reinforced responding. The remaining 55 phasic cells (92%) displayed patterned discharges relative to the cocaine-reinforced response (n = 26 cells), or relative to the water-reinforced response (n = 29 cells), but not both. For some rats (n = 3), food was substituted for water in the task. Again, the majority of phasic neurons (13 of 14 cells, 93%) exhibited nonoverlapping firing patterns across the drug and natural reinforcer conditions. These findings indicate that in the well-trained animal, cocaine activates a neural circuit in the Acb that is largely separate from the circuit that processes information about food and water reward.", "8819538": "Previous work has shown that opiate agonist infusion into the nucleus accumbens,  a region implicated in reinforcement, stimulates food intake. In the present study, the effects of opiate antagonist infusion into this region were examined in two behavioral paradigms. In the feeding test, food-deprived animals were tested for intake of laboratory chow. In the sucrose intake test, sated animals familiar with a 20% sucrose solution were tested. Before these tests, the following drugs were bilaterally infused into the accumbens: naloxone (0, 1, 10 and 30 micrograms; equivalent to 2.8, 28 and 83 nmol, respectively), naltrexone (0, 0.2, 2 and 20 micrograms; 0.55, 5.5 and 55 nmol, respectively), beta-funaltrexamine (0 and 15 micrograms; 31 nmol), naloxonazine (0 and 10 micrograms; 15 nmol), naltrindole (trial 1: 0, 1, 10 and 20 micrograms; 2.2, 22 and 44 nmol, respectively; trial 2: 0, 0.1 and 0.5 micrograms; 0.22 and 1.1 nmol, respectively) and nor-binaltorphimine (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 micrograms; 0.14, 1.4 and 14 nmol, respectively). Naloxone and naltrexone both significantly reduced sucrose drinking and did not affect feeding. Naloxone infused into the dorsolateral striatum, as a control, had no effect on sucrose drinking. Accumbens infusion of the mu antagonist beta-funaltrexamine reduced both sucrose drinking and feeding. The mu 1 antagonist naloxonazine did not influence intake behaviors, with the exception of a decrease in duration of chow feeding. In contrast, the delta antagonist naltrindole markedly potentiated both sucrose drinking and duration of chow feeding. In a replication of this effect, systemic naltrexone given concurrently blocked the enhancement. The kappa antagonist nor-binaltorphimine did not influence any parameters of ingestive behavior. Although some treatments also decreased motor activities, the overall profile of  behavior suggested specific effects on ingestive behavior. The putative contributions of mu and delta receptors within the nucleus accumbens to modulation of food reward are discussed.", "23580531": "We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural processes when music gains reward value the first time it is heard. The degree of activity  in the mesolimbic striatal regions, especially the nucleus accumbens, during music listening was the best predictor of the amount listeners were willing to spend on previously unheard music in an auction paradigm. Importantly, the auditory cortices, amygdala, and ventromedial prefrontal regions showed increased activity during listening conditions requiring valuation, but did not predict reward value, which was instead predicted by increasing functional connectivity of these regions with the nucleus accumbens as the reward value increased. Thus,  aesthetic rewards arise from the interaction between mesolimbic reward circuitry  and cortical networks involved in perceptual analysis and valuation.", "23441210": "BACKGROUND: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has previously been investigated clinically for the treatment of several psychiatric  conditions, including obsessive-compulsive disorder and treatment resistant depression. However, the mechanism underlying the therapeutic benefit of DBS, including the brain areas that are activated, remains largely unknown. Here, we utilized 3.0 T functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) changes in Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal to test the hypothesis that NAc/internal capsule DBS results in global neural network activation in a large animal (porcine) model METHODS: Animals (n\u200a=\u200a10) were implanted in the NAc/internal capsule with DBS electrodes and received stimulation (1, 3, and 5 V, 130 Hz, and pulse widths of 100 and 500 \u00b5sec). BOLD signal changes were evaluated using a gradient echo-echo  planar imaging (GRE-EPI) sequence in 3.0 T MRI. We used a normalized functional activation map for group analysis and applied general linear modeling across subjects (FDR<0.001). The anatomical location of the implanted DBS lead was confirmed with a CT scan RESULTS: We observed stimulation-evoked activation in the ipsilateral prefrontal  cortex, insula, cingulate and bilateral parahippocampal region along with decrease in BOLD signal in the ipsilateral dorsal region of the thalamus. Furthermore, as the stimulation voltage increased from 3 V to 5 V, the region of  BOLD signal modulation increased in insula, thalamus, and parahippocampal cortex  and decreased in the cingulate and prefrontal cortex. We also demonstrated that right and left NAc/internal capsule stimulation modulates identical areas ipsilateral to the side of the stimulation CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that NAc/internal capsule DBS results in modulation of psychiatrically important brain areas notably the prefrontal cortex, cingulate, and insular cortex, which may underlie the therapeutic effect  of NAc DBS in psychiatric disorders. Finally, our fMRI setup in the large animal  may be a useful platform for translational studies investigating the global neuromodulatory effects of DBS.", "23434914": "Little is known about the underlying neural mechanism of deep brain stimulation (DBS). We found that DBS targeted at the nucleus accumbens (NAc) normalized NAc activity, reduced excessive connectivity between the NAc and prefrontal cortex, and decreased frontal low-frequency oscillations during symptom provocation in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Our findings suggest that DBS is able to reduce maladaptive activity and connectivity of the stimulated region.", "22473055": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc-DBS) was associated with antidepressant, anxiolytic, and procognitive effects in a small sample of patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD), followed over 1 year. Results of long-term follow-up of up to 4 years of NAcc-DBS are described in a group of 11 patients. Clinical effects, quality of life (QoL), cognition, and safety are reported. Eleven patients were stimulated with DBS bilateral to the NAcc. Main outcome measures were clinical effect (Hamilton Depression Rating  Scale, Montgomery-Asperg Rating Scale of Depression, and Hamilton Anxiety Scale)  QoL (SF-36), cognition and safety at baseline, 12 months (n=11), 24 months (n=10), and last follow-up (maximum 4 years, n=5). Analyses were performed in an  intent-to-treat method with last observation carried forward, thus 11 patients contributed to each point in time. In all, 5 of 11 patients (45%) were classified as responders after 12 months and remained sustained responders without worsening of symptoms until last follow-up after 4 years. Both ratings of depression and anxiety were significantly reduced in the sample as a whole from first month of NAcc-DBS on. All patients improved in QoL measures. One non-responder committed suicide. No severe adverse events related to parameter change were reported. First-time, preliminary long-term data on NAcc-DBS have demonstrated a stable antidepressant and anxiolytic effect and an amelioration of QoL in this small sample of patients suffering from TRD.

Also, a meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM)  was used to characterize patterns of functional coactivations involving NAcc: The results of a structure-based meta-analyses of 57 fMRI and PET studies were submitted to activation likelihood estimation analysis to estimate consistent activation patterns across the different imaging studies. The results of the combined rsFC and MACM analyses show that spontaneous activity in NAcc predicts activity in regions implicated in reward circuitries, including orbitomedial prefrontal cortex, globus pallidus, thalamus, midbrain, amygdala, and insula. This confirms the key role of NAcc in the mesocorticolimbic system, which integrates inputs from limbic and cortical regions. We also detected activity in  brain regions having few or no direct anatomical connections with NAcc, such as sensorimotor cortex, cerebellum, medial and posterior parietal cortex, and medial/inferior temporal cortex, supporting the view that not all functional connections can be explained by anatomical connections but can also result from connections mediated by third areas. Our rsFC findings are in line with the results of the structure-based meta-analysis: MACM maps are superimposable with NAcc rsFC results, and the reward paradigm class is the one that most frequently  generates activation in NAcc. Our results overlap considerably with recently proposed schemata of the main neuron systems in the limbic forebrain and in the anterior part of the limbic midbrain in rodents and nonhuman primates.", "18400794": "Classically regarded as motor structures, the basal ganglia subserve a wide range of functions, including motor, cognitive, motivational, and emotional processes.  Consistent with this broad-reaching involvement in brain function, basal ganglia  dysfunction has been implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. Despite recent advances in human neuroimaging, models of basal ganglia circuitry continue to rely primarily upon inference from animal studies. Here, we provide a comprehensive functional connectivity analysis of basal ganglia circuitry in humans through a functional magnetic resonance imaging examination during rest. Voxelwise regression analyses substantiated the hypothesized motor,  cognitive, and affective divisions among striatal subregions, and provided in vivo evidence of a functional organization consistent with parallel and integrative loop models described in animals. Our findings also revealed subtler  distinctions within striatal subregions not previously appreciated by task-based  imaging approaches. For instance, the inferior ventral striatum is functionally connected with medial portions of orbitofrontal cortex, whereas a more superior ventral striatal seed is associated with medial and lateral portions. The ability to map multiple distinct striatal circuits in a single study in humans, as opposed to relying on meta-analyses of multiple studies, is a principal strength  of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. This approach holds promise for studying basal ganglia dysfunction in clinical disorders.", "18003839": "High-frequency deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) region is an effective therapeutic avenue for patients with treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Imaging studies suggest that DBS acts by suppressing the aberrant metabolism in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that is a hallmark of OCD; however, little is known about the mechanisms by which this occurs. We examined the effects of 30 min NAc DBS at 130 Hz on spontaneously active OFC neurons and local field potentials (LFPs) in addition to evoked responses elicited by single-pulse stimulation of the NAc or mediodorsal thalamus (MD) in urethane-anesthetized rats. NAc DBS reduced the mean firing rate of OFC neurons, although neurons receiving monosynaptic input from MD were less affected and some putative interneurons were excited by DBS. Single-pulse stimulation of the NAc produced a robust inhibition in OFC neurons that was attenuated after DBS, whereas excitatory responses were unchanged. In contrast, after DBS inhibitory responses evoked from MD were unchanged, whereas excitatory responses  were enhanced. NAc-evoked LFP responses were potentiated after DBS, whereas MD-evoked LFP responses were unchanged. NAc DBS also enhanced OFC spontaneous LFP oscillatory activity in the slow (0.5-4 Hz) frequency band. These results suggest that DBS of the NAc region may alleviate OCD symptoms by reducing activity in subsets of OFC neurons, potentially by driving recurrent inhibition though antidromic activation of corticostriatal axon collaterals. Moreover, selective potentiation of input to these inhibitory circuits may also contribute to the therapeutic effects produced by DBS in OCD patients.", "17998440": "Imaging studies have provided new insights on the role of dopamine (DA) in drug abuse and addiction in the human brain. These studies have shown that the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse in human beings are contingent not just on  DA increases per se in the striatum (including the nucleus accumbens) but on the  rate of DA increases. The faster the increases, the more intense the reinforcing  effects. They have also shown that elevated levels of DA in the dorsal striatum are involved in the motivation to procure the drug when the addicted subject is exposed to stimuli associated with the drug (conditioned stimuli). In contrast, long-term drug use seems to be associated with decreased DA function, as evidenced by reductions in D2 DA receptors and DA release in the striatum in addicted subjects. Moreover, the reductions in D2 DA receptors in the striatum are associated with reduced activity of the orbitofrontal cortex (region involved with salience attribution and motivation and with compulsive behaviors) and of the cingulate gyrus (region involved with inhibitory control and impulsivity), which implicates deregulation of frontal regions by DA in the loss of control and compulsive drug intake that characterizes addiction. Because DA cells fire in response to salient stimuli and facilitate conditioned learning, their activation by drugs will be experienced as highly salient, driving the motivation to take the drug and further strengthening conditioned learning and producing automatic behaviors (compulsions and habits).", "17429407": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to different sites allows interfering with dysfunctional network function implicated in major depression. Because a prominent clinical feature of depression is anhedonia--the inability to experience pleasure from previously pleasurable activities--and because there is  clear evidence of dysfunctions of the reward system in depression, DBS to the nucleus accumbens might offer a new possibility to target depressive symptomatology in otherwise treatment-resistant depression. Three patients suffering from extremely resistant forms of depression, who did not respond to pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy, were implanted with bilateral DBS electrodes in the nucleus accumbens. Stimulation parameters were modified in a double-blind manner, and clinical ratings were assessed at each modification. Additionally, brain metabolism was assessed 1 week before and  1 week after stimulation onset. Clinical ratings improved in all three patients when the stimulator was on, and worsened in all three patients when the stimulator was turned off. Effects were observable immediately, and no side effects occurred in any of the patients. Using FDG-PET, significant changes in brain metabolism as a function of the stimulation in fronto-striatal networks were observed. No unwanted effects of DBS other than those directly related to the surgical procedure (eg pain at sites of implantation) were observed. Dysfunctions of the reward system--in which the nucleus accumbens is a key structure--are implicated in the neurobiology of major depression and might be responsible for impaired reward processing, as evidenced by the symptom of anhedonia. These preliminary findings suggest that DBS to the nucleus accumbens might be a hypothesis-guided approach for refractory major depression.", "15748841": "Treatment-resistant depression is a severely disabling disorder with no proven treatment options once multiple medications, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy have failed. Based on our preliminary observation that the subgenual cingulate region (Brodmann area 25) is metabolically overactive in treatment-resistant depression, we studied whether the application of chronic deep brain stimulation to modulate BA25 could reduce this elevated activity and produce clinical benefit in six patients with refractory depression. Chronic stimulation of white matter tracts adjacent to the subgenual cingulate gyrus was  associated with a striking and sustained remission of depression in four of six patients. Antidepressant effects were associated with a marked reduction in local cerebral blood flow as well as changes in downstream limbic and cortical sites, measured using positron emission tomography. These results suggest that disrupting focal pathological activity in limbic-cortical circuits using electrical stimulation of the subgenual cingulate white matter can effectively reverse symptoms in otherwise treatment-resistant depression.", "8812068": "A package of computer programs for analysis and visualization of three-dimensional human brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) results is described.

The present study aimed to identify this type of abnormality within the brain networks implicated in addiction by resting-state functional connectivity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). With fMRI data acquired during resting state from 14 chronic heroin users (12 of whom were being treated with methadone) and 13 non-addicted controls, we investigated the addiction related alteration in functional connectivity between  the regions in the circuits implicated in addiction with seed-based correlation analysis. Compared with controls, chronic heroin users showed increased functional connectivity between nucleus accumbens and ventral/rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), between nucleus accumbens and orbital frontal cortex (OFC), and between amygdala and OFC and reduced functional connectivity between prefrontal cortex and OFC and between prefrontal cortex and ACC. These observations of altered resting-state functional connectivity suggested abnormal  functional organization in the addicted brain and may provide additional evidence supporting the theory of addiction that emphasizes enhanced salience value of a drug and its related cues but weakened cognitive control in the addictive state.", "2648975": "While the evidence is strong that dopamine plays some fundamental and special role in the rewarding effects of brain stimulation, psychomotor stimulants, opiates, and food, the exact nature of that role is not clear. One thing is clear: Dopamine is not the only reward transmitter, and dopaminergic neurons are  not the final common path for all rewards. Dopamine antagonists and lesions of the dopamine systems appear to spare the rewarding effects of nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex brain stimulation (Simon et al 1979) and certainly spare the rewarding effects of apomorphine (Roberts & Vickers 1988). It is clear that reward circuitry is multisynaptic, and since dopamine cells do not send axons to  each other or receive axons from each other, dopamine can at best serve as but a  single link in this circuitry. If dopamine is not a final common path for all rewards, could it be an intermediate common path for most rewards? Some workers have argued against such a view, but at present they must do so on incomplete evidence. For example, Phillips (1984) has argued that there must be multiple reward systems, functionally independent and organized in parallel with one another. His primary evidence, however, is the fact that brain stimulation is rewarding at different levels of the nervous system. As we have seen in the case  of midline mesencephalic stimulation, the location of the electrode tip in relation to the dopamine cells and fibers tells us little about the role of dopamine in brain stimulation reward. It seems clear that the ventral tegmental dopamine system plays a critical role in midline mesencephalic reward, despite the distance from the electrode tip to the dopamine cells where morphine causes its dopamine-dependent facilitory effects or to the dopamine terminals where low-dose neuroleptics presumably cause theirs. Until pharmacological challenge has been extended to the cases discussed by Phillips, we can only speculate as to the role of dopamine in each of those cases. In the cases where pharmacological challenge has been examined, only nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex have been  found to have dopamine-independent reward sites. It is not consistent with the dopamine hypothesis that dopamine-independent reward sites should exist in these  areas, since any reward signals carried to nucleus accumbens or frontal cortex by dopamine fibers would-unless we are to believe that reward \"happens\" at these sites-have to be carried to the next stage of the circuit by nondopaminergic fibers (there are no dopaminergic cell bodies in any of the dopamine terminal areas).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "27181059": "Depression is a complex, heterogeneous disorder and a leading contributor to the  global burden of disease. Most previous research has focused on individual brain  regions and genes contributing to depression.

Here, we\u00a0performed RNA sequencing on four brain regions\u00a0from control animals and those  susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress at multiple time points. We employed an integrative network biology approach to identify transcriptional networks and key driver genes that regulate susceptibility to\u00a0depressive-like symptoms. Further, we validated in\u00a0vivo several key drivers and their associated  transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility and confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior.

Here we report that exposure to subchronic variable stress (SCVS) induces depression-associated behaviors in female mice, whereas males are resilient as they do not develop these behavioral abnormalities. In concert with these different behavioral responses, transcriptional analysis of nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major brain reward region, by use of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed markedly different patterns of stress regulation of gene expression between the sexes. Among the genes displaying sex differences was DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a), which shows a greater induction in females after SCVS. Interestingly, Dnmt3a expression levels were increased in the NAc of depressed humans, an effect seen in both males and females. Local overexpression of Dnmt3a in NAc rendered male mice more susceptible to SCVS, whereas Dnmt3a knock-out in this region rendered females more resilient, directly implicating this gene in stress responses. Associated with this enhanced resilience of female mice upon NAc knock-out of Dnmt3a was a partial shift of the NAc female transcriptome toward the male pattern after SCVS. These data indicate that males and females undergo different patterns of transcriptional regulation in response to stress and that a DNA methyltransferase in NAc contributes to sex differences in stress vulnerability.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Women have a higher incidence of depression than men. However, preclinical models, the first step in developing new diagnostics and therapeutics, have been performed mainly on male subjects. Using a stress-based animal model of depression that causes behavioral effects in females but not males, we demonstrate a sex-specific transcriptional profile in brain reward circuitry. This transcriptional profile can be altered by removal of an epigenetic mechanism, which normally suppresses DNA transcription, creating a hybrid male/female transcriptional pattern. Removal of this epigenetic mechanism  also induces behavioral resilience to stress in females.

For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.

Such findings have figured importantly in recent theories of drug addiction proposing that sensitized nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopamine (DA) overflow in particular acts in  concert with other alterations in the neurochemistry of this nucleus to promote drug seeking and self-administration. Yet, experiments in rodents, non-human primates and humans have not always detected behavioral or biochemical sensitization following drug exposure, bringing into doubt the utility of this model. In an effort to reconcile apparent discrepancies in the literature, this review assesses conditions that might affect the expression of sensitization during testing. Specifically, the role played by conditioned cues is reviewed. A  number of reports strongly support a potent and critical role for conditioned stimuli in the expression of sensitization. Findings suggest that stimuli associated either with the presence or absence of drug can respectively facilitate or inhibit sensitized responding. It is concluded that the presence or absence of such stimuli during testing for sensitization in animal and human studies could significantly affect the results obtained. It is necessary to consider this possibility especially when interpreting the results of studies that fail to observe sensitized responding.", "18640920": "We present a brief overview of the incentive sensitization theory of addiction. This posits that addiction is caused primarily by drug-induced sensitization in the brain mesocorticolimbic systems that attribute incentive salience to reward-associated stimuli.

We address some current  questions including: what is the role of learning in incentive sensitization and  addiction? Does incentive sensitization occur in human addicts? Is the development of addiction-like behaviour in animals associated with sensitization? What is the best way to model addiction symptoms using animal models?

METHODS: In the current study, extracellular levels of glutamate and glutamate transport in the nucleus accumbens were assayed 24 hr after repeated ethanol exposure (1 g/kg ip daily for 7 days) with use of in vivo no-net-flux microdialysis and in vitro [(3)H]glutamate uptake, respectively. RESULTS: Microdialysis revealed higher extracellular glutamate concentrations in  the nucleus accumbens of rats that were given ethanol. The increase in basal extracellular glutamate levels was accounted for in part by a decrease in the in  vivo probe recovery of glutamate. Moreover, an in vitro accumbens slice preparation measuring [(3)H]glutamate uptake revealed that Na(+)-dependent [(3)H]glutamate uptake was significantly reduced 24 hr after 7 days of repeated ethanol exposure. The ethanol-induced deficit in glutamate uptake was not associated with decreased total tissue levels of the transporters GLAST or GLT1.  The in vivo and in vitro ethanol-induced changes in glutamate levels and uptake returned to control levels 14 days after discontinuing 7 days of repeated ethanol exposure. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the previously reported increases in extracellular glutamate induced by ethanol exposure may be due in part to deficits in glutamate transport.", "10541725": "RATIONALE: Stimulation of locomotor activity by low doses of ethanol (EtOH) and the potentiation of this response after repeated administration (sensitization) have been related to EtOH's rewarding and addictive properties and to altered dopaminergic activity in brain. In mice, behavioral sensitization to EtOH occurs  only in a subset of treated animals, and this provides an opportunity for distinguishing general drug effects from sensitization-specific brain effects. OBJECTIVES: In view of evidence suggesting a role for dopamine D2 receptors in EtOH preference and abuse liability, the present study addressed the hypothesis that D2 binding would be altered in specific brain regions in mice showing differential sensitization responses to chronic EtOH administration. METHODS: Male albino Swiss mice received 2.4 g/kg EtOH i.p. daily for 21 days and were then separated into sensitized or non-sensitized subgroups on the basis of weekly locomotor activity tests. RESULTS: Autoradiographic analyses of [(3)H]raclopride binding to D2 sites revealed significant increases in the anterior caudate-putamen of mice in the EtOH-sensitized group when compared with either saline controls (+40%, P<0.00009) or to mice in the EtOH non-sensitized group (+32%; P<0.0003). Smaller increases were seen in the ventrolateral caudate-putamen of sensitized animals (+18% vs. control, P<0.02; and 12% vs. non-sensitized mice, P<0.07). No differences were found in other brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens, olfactory bulb and substantia nigra. CONCLUSIONS: The observed increases in D2-receptor binding in circumscribed targets of nigrostriatal projections may reflect either a pre-existing condition  in sensitization-prone animals or a selective vulnerability of D2 receptors to chronic EtOH in these animals. In either case, it may be a marker for differential susceptibility to EtOH sensitization.", "26733685": "Little is known about the molecular similarities and differences between neurons  in the ventral (vSt) and dorsal striatum (dSt) and their physiological implications. In the vSt, serotonin [5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] modulates mood control and pleasure response, whereas in the dSt, 5-HT regulates motor behavior. Here we show that, in mice, 5-HT depolarizes cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) of the dSt whereas hyperpolarizing ChIs from the vSt by acting on different 5-HT receptor isoforms. In the vSt, 5-HT1A (a postsynaptic receptor) and 5-HT1B (a presynaptic receptor) are highly expressed, and synergistically inhibit the excitability of ChIs. The inhibitory modulation by 5-HT1B, but not that by 5-HT1A, is mediated by p11, a protein associated with major depressive disorder.

Accumulating evidence suggests that such motivational role of dopamine neurons is not limited to those located in the ventral tegmental area, but also in the substantia nigra. The present paper reviews previous rodent work concerning dopamine's role in approach motivation and the connectivity of dopamine neurons,  and proposes two working models: One concerns the relationship between extracellular dopamine concentration and approach motivation. High, moderate and  low concentrations of extracellular dopamine induce euphoric, seeking and aversive states, respectively. The other concerns circuit loops involving the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, epithalamus, and midbrain through which dopaminergic activity alters approach motivation. These models should help to generate hypothesis-driven research and provide insights for understanding altered states associated with drugs of abuse and affective disorders.", "25319571": "We previously reported that animals withdrawn from repeated cocaine exposure exhibited a selective deficit in the ability to elicit metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5)-dependent long-term depression (LTD) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. To determine whether such impairment occurs in the NAc in a cell-type-specific manner, we used bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) under the control of gene regulatory elements for the dopamine D1 receptor (Drd1) or dopamine D2 receptor (Drd2) to identify distinct subpopulations of medium spiny neurons (MSNs). We found that bath application of group I mGluR agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) reliably induced LTD in both NAc shell and  core MSNs of wild-type, hemizygous Drd1-eGFP, and Drd2-eGFP mice. Confirming our  previous results, cocaine withdrawal selectively impaired DHPG-LTD in NAc shell Drd1-expressing direct and Drd2-expressing indirect pathway MSNs. We also found that the expression of DHPG-LTD in NAc MSNs was not affected by the Ca(2+)-permeable \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor antagonist 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine. Furthermore, systemic administration of mGluR5-negative allosteric modulator fenobam before the daily injection of cocaine preserved mGluR5 function and significantly reduced the expression of cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization. These results reveal that withdrawal from repeated cocaine exposure may result in the impairment of NAc mGluR5-LTD in  a subregion- but not cell-type-specific manner and suggests that pharmacological  antagonism of mGluR5 may represent a potential strategy for reducing cocaine-induced addictive behaviors.", "24903651": "Our understanding of the active role that astrocytes play in modulating neuronal  function and behavior is rapidly expanding, but little is known about the role that astrocytes may play in drug-seeking behavior for commonly abused substances. Given that the nucleus accumbens is critically involved in substance abuse and motivation, we sought to determine whether nucleus accumbens astrocytes influence the motivation to self-administer ethanol following abstinence. We found that the packing density of astrocytes that were expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein increased in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) during abstinence from EtOH self-administration. No change was observed in the nucleus accumbens shell.  This increased NAcore astrocyte density positively correlated with the motivation for ethanol. Astrocytes can communicate with one another and influence neuronal activity through gap-junction hemichannels. Because of this, the effect of blocking gap-junction hemichannels on the motivation for ethanol was examined. The motivation to self-administer ethanol after 3 weeks abstinence was increased  following microinjection of gap-junction hemichannel blockers into the NAcore at  doses that block both neuronal and astrocytic channels. In contrast, no effect was observed following microinjection of doses that are not thought to block astrocytic channels or following microinjection of either dose into the nucleus accumbens shell. Additionally, the motivation for sucrose after 3 weeks abstinence was unaffected by NAcore gap-junction hemichannel blockers. Next, Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) were selectively expressed in NAcore astrocytes to test the effect of astrocyte stimulation. DREADD activation increased cytosolic calcium in primary astrocytes, facilitated responding for rewarding brain stimulation, and reduced the motivation for ethanol after 3 weeks abstinence. This is the first work to modulate drug-seeking behavior with astrocyte-specific DREADDs. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that NAcore astrocytes can shape the motivation to self-administer ethanol; suggesting that the development of ligands which selectively stimulate astrocytes may be a successful strategy to abate ethanol-seeking behavior.", "24067300": "Using a well-established model of ethanol dependence and relapse, this study examined adaptations in glutamatergic transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and their role in regulating voluntary ethanol drinking. Mice were first trained  to drink ethanol in a free-choice, limited access (2\u2009h/day) paradigm. One group (EtOH mice) received repeated weekly cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure with intervening weeks of test drinking sessions, whereas the remaining  mice (CTL mice) were similarly treated but did not receive CIE treatment. Over repeated cycles of CIE exposure, EtOH mice exhibited significant escalation in drinking (up to \u223c3.5\u2009g/kg), whereas drinking remained relatively stable at baseline levels (2-2.5\u2009g/kg) in CTL mice. Using in vivo microdialysis procedures, extracellular glutamate (GLUEX) levels in the NAc were increased approximately twofold in EtOH mice compared with CTL mice, and this difference was observed 7 days after final CIE exposure, indicating that this hyperglutamatergic state persisted beyond acute withdrawal. This finding prompted additional studies examining the effects of pharmacologically manipulating GLUEX in the NAc on ethanol drinking in the CIE model. The non-selective glutamate reuptake antagonist, threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA), was bilaterally microinjected into the NAc and found to dose-dependently increase drinking in nondependent (CTL) mice to levels attained by dependent (EtOH) mice. TBOA also further increased drinking in EtOH mice. In contrast, reducing glutamatergic transmission in the NAc via bilateral injections of the metabotropic glutamate receptor-2/3 agonist LY379268 reduced drinking in dependent (EtOH) mice to nondependent (CTL) levels,  whereas having a more modest effect in decreasing ethanol consumption in CTL mice. Taken together, these data support an important role of glutamatergic transmission in the NAc in regulating ethanol drinking. Additionally, these results indicate that ethanol dependence produces adaptations that favor elevated glutamate activity in the NAc which, in turn, promote excessive levels of ethanol consumption associated with dependence.", "22733786": "A large number of studies have demonstrated that the nucleus accumbens (NAC) is a critical site in the neuronal circuits controlling reward responses, motivation,  and mood, but the neuronal cell type(s) underlying these processes are not yet known. Identification of the neuronal cell types that regulate depression-like states will guide us in understanding the biological basis of mood and its regulation by diseases like major depressive disorder. Taking advantage of recent findings demonstrating that the serotonin receptor chaperone, p11, is an important molecular regulator of depression-like states, here we identify cholinergic interneurons (CINs) as a primary site of action for p11 in the NAC. Depression-like behavior is observed in mice after decrease of p11 levels in NAC  CINs. This phenotype is recapitulated by silencing neuronal transmission in these cells, demonstrating that accumbal cholinergic neuronal activity regulates depression-like behaviors and suggesting that accumbal CIN activity is crucial for the regulation of mood and motivation.", "22150987": "Objectives.\u2002\u2002 Identification, delimitation, and stereotactic localization of the  human nucleus accumbens (Acc) in order to allow its accurate definition and three-dimensional targeting on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enabling its use  for deep brain stimulation. Methods.\u2002\u2002 Magnetic resonance imaging and anatomical  coronal serial cuts were performed on 24 Acc from human cadaver brains perpendicular to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure line; identification, localization, and determination of its dimensions and three-dimensional stereotactic coordinates. Results.\u2002\u2002 Twenty Acc were studied anatomically, 14 by MRI and 12 by both methods. The contours of the Acc were traced and the dimensions measured; mean values: length 10.5\u00a0mm, width 14.5\u00a0mm and height 7.0\u00a0mm. The stereotactic coordinates were obtained every millimeter along its length. Conclusion.\u2002\u2002 It was possible to identify well the human Acc, define its limits and establish its three-dimensional coordinates as potential MRI-guided stereotactic target.", "21368141": "Recent findings suggest that extrasynaptic \u03b4-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors are sensitive to low-to-moderate concentrations of alcohol, raising the possibility that these receptors mediate the reinforcing effects of alcohol after consumption of one or a few drinks. We used the technique of viral-mediated RNAi  to reduce expression of the GABA(A) receptor \u03b4-subunit in adult rats in localized regions of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) to test the hypothesis that \u03b4-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors in the NAc are necessary for oral alcohol  consumption. We found that knockdown of the \u03b4-subunit in the medial shell region  of the NAc, but not in the ventral or lateral shell or in the core, reduced alcohol intake. In contrast, \u03b4-subunit knockdown in the medial shell did not affect intake of a 2% sucrose solution, suggesting that the effects of GABA(A) receptor \u03b4-subunit reduction are specific to alcohol. These results provide strong evidence that extrasynaptic \u03b4-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors in the  medial shell of the NAc are critical for the reinforcing effects of oral ethanol.", "20416052": "BACKGROUND: Previous lesion, electrical self-stimulation and drug addiction studies suggest that the midbrain dopamine systems are parts of the reward system of the brain. This review provides an updated overview about the basic signals of dopamine neurons to environmental stimuli. METHODS: The described experiments used standard behavioral and neurophysiological methods to record the activity of single dopamine neurons in awake monkeys during specific behavioral tasks. RESULTS: Dopamine neurons show phasic activations to external stimuli. The signal reflects reward, physical salience, risk and punishment, in descending order of fractions of responding neurons. Expected reward value is a key decision variable for economic choices. The reward response codes reward value, probability and their summed product, expected value. The neurons code reward value as it differs from prediction, thus fulfilling the basic requirement for a bidirectional prediction error teaching signal postulated by learning theory. This response is  scaled in units of standard deviation. By contrast, relatively few dopamine neurons show the phasic activation following punishers and conditioned aversive stimuli, suggesting a lack of relationship of the reward response to general attention and arousal. Large proportions of dopamine neurons are also activated by intense, physically salient stimuli. This response is enhanced when the stimuli are novel; it appears to be distinct from the reward value signal. Dopamine neurons show also unspecific activations to non-rewarding stimuli that are possibly due to generalization by similar stimuli and pseudoconditioning by primary rewards. These activations are shorter than reward responses and are often followed by depression of activity. A separate, slower dopamine signal informs about risk, another important decision variable. The prediction error response occurs only with reward; it is scaled by the risk of predicted reward. CONCLUSIONS: Neurophysiological studies reveal phasic dopamine signals that transmit information related predominantly but not exclusively to reward. Although not being entirely homogeneous, the dopamine signal is more restricted and stereotyped than neuronal activity in most other brain structures involved in goal directed behavior.", "18654637": "There is accumulating evidence that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of depression. Given that clinical depression is marked by anhedonia (diminished interest or pleasure), dysfunction  of the brain reward pathway has been suggested as contributing to the pathophysiology of depression.Since the NAc is the center of reward and learning, it is hypothesized that anhedonia might be produced by hampering the function of  the NAc. Indeed, it has been reported that stress, drug exposure and drug withdrawal, all of which produce a depressive-phenotype, alter various functions  within the NAc, leading to inhibited dopaminergic activity in the NAc.In this review, we describe various factors as possible candidates within the NAc for the initiation of depressive symptoms. First, we discuss the roles of several neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the functioning of the NAc, including dopamine, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine, serotonin, dynorphin, enkephaline, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and cocaine-  and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). Second, based on previous studies, we propose hypothetical relationships among these substances and the shell and core subregions of the NAc.", "18524910": "The rat prelimbic prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens core are critical for initiating cocaine seeking. In contrast, the neural circuitry responsible for inhibiting cocaine seeking during extinction is unknown. The present findings using inhibition of selected brain nuclei with GABA agonists show that the suppression of cocaine seeking produced by previous extinction training required  activity in the rat infralimbic cortex. Conversely, the reinstatement of drug seeking by a cocaine injection in extinguished animals was suppressed by increasing neuronal activity in infralimbic cortex with the glutamate agonist AMPA. The cocaine seeking induced by inactivating infralimbic cortex resembled other forms of reinstated drug seeking by depending on activity in prelimbic cortex and the basolateral amygdala. A primary efferent projection from the infralimbic cortex is to the nucleus accumbens shell. Akin to infralimbic cortex, inhibition of the accumbens shell induced cocaine seeking in extinguished rats. However, bilateral inhibition of the shell also elicited increased locomotor activity. Nonetheless, unilateral inhibition of the accumbens shell did not increase motor activity, and simultaneous unilateral inactivation of the infralimbic cortex and shell induced cocaine seeking, suggesting that an interaction between these two structures is necessary for extinction training to  inhibit cocaine seeking. The infralimbic cortex and accumbens shell appear to be  recruited by extinction learning because inactivation of these structures before  extinction training did not alter cocaine seeking. Together, these findings suggest that a neuronal network involving the infralimbic cortex and accumbens shell is recruited by extinction training to suppress cocaine seeking.", "17406653": "Cannabinoid drugs such as Delta9-THC are euphoric and rewarding, and also stimulate food intake in humans and animals. Little is known about how naturally  occurring endogenous brain cannabinoids mediate pleasure from food or other natural sensory rewards. The taste reactivity paradigm measures effects of brain  manipulations on affective orofacial reactions to intraorally administered pleasant and unpleasant tastes. Here we tested if anandamide microinjection into  medial nucleus accumbens shell enhances these affective reactions to sweet and bitter tastes in rats. Anandamide doubled the number of positive 'liking' reactions elicited by intraoral sucrose, without altering negative 'disliking' reactions to bitter quinine. Anandamide microinjections produced Fos plumes of approximately 0.02-1 mm3 volume. Plume-based maps, integrated with behavioral data, identified the medial shell of accumbens as the anatomical hotspot responsible for hedonic amplification. Anandamide produced especially intense hedonic enhancement in a roughly 1.6 mm3 'hedonic hotspot' in dorsal medial shell, where anandamide also stimulated eating behavior. These results demonstrate that endocannabinoid signals within medial accumbens shell specifically amplify the positive hedonic impact of a natural reward (though identification of the receptor specificity of this effect will require future studies). Identification of an endocannabinoid hotspot for sensory pleasure gives insight into brain mechanisms of natural reward, and may be relevant to understanding the neural effects of cannabinoid drugs of abuse and therapeutic agents.", "17259307": "Although metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is essential for cocaine self-administration and drug-seeking behavior, there is limited knowledge of the  cellular actions of this receptor in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Although mGluR5 has the potential to regulate neurons directly, recent studies have shown the importance of mGluR5 in regulating Ca(2+) signaling in astrocytes and, as a consequence, the Ca(2+)-dependent release of excitatory transmitters from these glia. In this study, we demonstrate that activation of mGluR5 induces Ca(2+) oscillations in NAc astrocytes with the correlated appearance of NMDA receptor-dependent slow inward currents detected in medium spiny neurons (MSNs).  Photolysis of caged Ca(2+) loaded specifically into astrocytes evoked slow inward currents demonstrating that Ca(2+) elevations in astrocytes are responsible for these excitatory events. Pharmacological evaluation of these glial-evoked NMDA currents shows that they are mediated by NR2B-containing NMDA receptors, whereas  synaptic NMDA receptors rely on NR2A-containing receptors. Stimulation of glutamatergic afferents activates mGluR5-dependent astrocytic Ca(2+) oscillations and gliotransmission that is sustained for minutes beyond the initial stimulus. Because gliotransmission is mediated by NMDA receptors, depolarized membrane potentials exhibited during up-states augment excitation provided by gliotransmission, which drives bursts of MSN action potentials. Because the predominant mGluR5-dependent action of glutamatergic afferents is to cause the sustained activation of astrocytes, which in turn excite MSNs through extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, our results raise the potential for gliotransmission being involved in prolonged mGluR5-dependent adaptation in the NAc.", "16289609": "Work over the past decade has supported the idea that discrete aspects of appetitive motivation are differentially mediated by separate but interacting neurochemical systems within the nucleus accumbens (Acb). We review herein a series of studies in rats comparing the effects of manipulating Acb amino acid, opioid, acetylcholine, and dopamine systems on tests of free-feeding and food-reinforced operant responding. Results from our laboratory and in the literature support three general conclusions: (1) GABA output neurons localized exclusively within the Acb shell directly influence hypothalamic effector mechanisms for feeding motor patterns, but do not participate in the execution of more complex food-seeking strategies; (2) enkephalinergic neurons distributed throughout the Acb and caudate-putamen mediate the hedonic impact of palatable (high sugar/fat) foods, and these neurons are under modulatory control by striatal cholinergic interneurons; and (3) dopamine transmission in the Acb governs general motoric and arousal processes related to response selection and invigoration, as well as motor learning-related plasticity. These dissociations may reflect the manner in which these neurochemical systems differentially access pallido-thalamo-cortical loops reaching the voluntary motor system (in the case of opioids and dopamine), versus more restricted efferent connections to hypothalamic motor/autonomic control columns (in the case of Acb shell GABA and glutamate systems). Moreover, we hypothesize that while these systems work in tandem to coordinate the anticipatory and consummatory phases of feeding with hypothalamic energy-sensing substrates, the striatal opioid network evolved a specialized capacity to promote overeating of energy-dense foods beyond acute homeostatic needs, to ensure an energy reserve for potential future famine.", "15691387": "BACKGROUND: Delays between actions and their outcomes severely hinder reinforcement learning systems, but little is known of the neural mechanism by which animals overcome this problem and bridge such delays. The nucleus accumbens core (AcbC), part of the ventral striatum, is required for normal preference for  a large, delayed reward over a small, immediate reward (self-controlled choice) in rats, but the reason for this is unclear. We investigated the role of the AcbC in learning a free-operant instrumental response using delayed reinforcement, performance of a previously-learned response for delayed reinforcement, and assessment of the relative magnitudes of two different rewards. RESULTS: Groups of rats with excitotoxic or sham lesions of the AcbC acquired an  instrumental response with different delays (0, 10, or 20 s) between the lever-press response and reinforcer delivery. A second (inactive) lever was also  present, but responding on it was never reinforced. As expected, the delays retarded learning in normal rats. AcbC lesions did not hinder learning in the absence of delays, but AcbC-lesioned rats were impaired in learning when there was a delay, relative to sham-operated controls. All groups eventually acquired the response and discriminated the active lever from the inactive lever to some degree. Rats were subsequently trained to discriminate reinforcers of different magnitudes. AcbC-lesioned rats were more sensitive to differences in reinforcer magnitude than sham-operated controls, suggesting that the deficit in self-controlled choice previously observed in such rats was a consequence of reduced preference for delayed rewards relative to immediate rewards, not of reduced preference for large rewards relative to small rewards. AcbC lesions also impaired the performance of a previously-learned instrumental response in a delay-dependent fashion. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the AcbC contributes to instrumental  learning and performance by bridging delays between subjects' actions and the ensuing outcomes that reinforce behaviour.", "11752112": "The regulation of extracellular glutamate in the nucleus accumbens by group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3) was examined in vivo. Stimulation of  mGluR2/3 with 2R,4R-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (APDC) or N-acetylaspartylglutamate reduced extracellular glutamate levels. Conversely, blockade of mGluR2/3 by LY143495 or (RS)-1-amino-5-phosphonoindan-1-carboxylic acid (APICA) increased extracellular glutamate, an effect antagonized by the coadministration of APDC. These effects likely involve both vesicular and nonvesicular glutamate, because the increase in glutamate by APICA or the decrease by APDC was prevented by blocking N-type calcium channels and the release of glutamate after potassium-induced membrane depolarization was antagonized by APDC. In addition, blockade of the cystine-glutamate exchange, a major nonvesicular source of extracellular glutamate, by (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine blocked the effects induced by either APDC or APICA. However, blockade of Na(+) channels by tetrodotoxin or Na(+)-dependent glutamate  transporters by DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate failed to affect the alterations in extracellular glutamate by APICA or APDC, respectively. Group II mGluRs are G(i)-coupled and coperfusion with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activator Sp-cAMPS blocked the reduction in glutamate by APDC and the PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPS prevented the elevation in glutamate by APICA. Taken together, these data support three conclusions: 1) group II mGluRs regulate both vesicular  and nonvesicular release of glutamate in the nucleus accumbens, 2) there is tonic in vivo stimulation of mGluR2/3 by endogenous glutamate, and 3) modulation of group II mGluRs of extracellular glutamate is Ca(2+)- and PKA-dependent.", "10654664": "Neuroanatomical substrates associated in the literature with adaptive responding  are discussed, with a focus on the nucleus accumbens. While it is emphasized that the accumbens exhibits multiple levels of complex organization, a fairly complete list of brief descriptions of recent studies devoted specifically to the accumbens shell and core subterritories is presented in tabular format. The distinct patterns of connectivity of the accumbens core and shell and structures  related to them by connections are described. Multiple inputs, outputs and abundant reciprocity of connections within the ventral parts of the basal ganglia are emphasized and the implications for \"through-put\" of impulses is considered.  It is noted, at least on neuroanatomical grounds, that there is ample reason to expect feed forward processing from shell and structures with which it is associated to core and structures with which it is associated. Furthermore, the potential for additional feed forward processing involving several forebrain functional anatomical systems, inlcuding the ventral striatopallidum, extended amygdala and magnocellular basal forebrain complex is considered. It is intended  that from the considerations recorded here a conceptual framework will begin to emerge that is amenable to further experimental substantiation as regards how multiple basal forebrain systems and the cortices to which they are related by connections work together to fashion a unitary object--the adaptive response.", "10235641": "Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is a novel mRNA whose level  of expression was found to be increased in the striatum after acute administration of psychomotor stimulants in rats. To define better the potential  role of CART peptides in behavioural and physiologic changes induced by psychomotor stimulants, we analyzed the distribution, ultrastructural features, synaptic connectivity, and transmitter content of CART peptide-immunoreactive neurones in the nucleus accumbens in monkeys. Medium-sized CART peptide-immunoreactive neurones within a rich plexus of labelled varicosities were found mostly in the medial division of the shell of the nucleus accumbens in monkeys. At the electron microscope level, CART peptide immunoreactivity was exclusively associated with neuronal structures that included perikarya, dendrites, spines as well as nerve terminals packed with electron-lucent and dense-core vesicles. Most CART peptide-containing somata displayed the ultrastructural features of striatal output neurones. The majority of labelled terminals formed symmetric axodendritic synapses and displayed gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunoreactivity. CART peptide-immunoreactive somata were not immunoreactive for parvalbumin and somatostatin, two markers of striatal interneurones, nor for calbindin D-28k, a marker of a subpopulation of projection neurones. In double-immunostained sections, CART peptide-immunoreactive dendrites were found to be contacted by tyrosine hydroxylase-positive terminals which displayed the ultrastructural features of dopamine-containing boutons. These findings strongly suggest that CART peptides may be a cotransmitter with GABA in  a subpopulation of projection neurones in the monkey accumbens. Furthermore, the  fact that CART peptide-immunoreactive neurones receive direct synaptic inputs from dopaminergic afferents and are particularly abundant in the caudomedial division of the shell of the nucleus accumbens suggest that CART peptides might be involved in neuronal and behavioural changes that underlie addiction to psychomotor stimulants and feeding in primates.", "9858756": "What roles do mesolimbic and neostriatal dopamine systems play in reward? Do they mediate the hedonic impact of rewarding stimuli? Do they mediate hedonic reward learning and associative prediction? Our review of the literature, together with  results of a new study of residual reward capacity after dopamine depletion, indicates the answer to both questions is 'no'. Rather, dopamine systems may mediate the incentive salience of rewards, modulating their motivational value in a manner separable from hedonia and reward learning. In a study of the consequences of dopamine loss, rats were depleted of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum by up to 99% using 6-hydroxydopamine. In a series of experiments, we applied the 'taste reactivity' measure of affective reactions (gapes, etc.) to assess the capacity of dopamine-depleted rats for: 1) normal affect (hedonic and aversive reactions), 2) modulation of hedonic affect by associative learning (taste aversion conditioning), and 3) hedonic enhancement of affect by non-dopaminergic pharmacological manipulation of palatability (benzodiazepine administration). We found normal hedonic reaction patterns to sucrose vs. quinine, normal learning of new hedonic stimulus values (a change in  palatability based on predictive relations), and normal pharmacological hedonic enhancement of palatability. We discuss these results in the context of hypotheses and data concerning the role of dopamine in reward. We review neurochemical, electrophysiological, and other behavioral evidence. We conclude that dopamine systems are not needed either to mediate the hedonic pleasure of reinforcers or to mediate predictive associations involved in hedonic reward learning. We conclude instead that dopamine may be more important to incentive salience attributions to the neural representations of reward-related stimuli. Incentive salience, we suggest, is a distinct component of motivation and reward. In other words, dopamine systems are necessary for 'wanting' incentives, but not  for 'liking' them or for learning new 'likes' and 'dislikes'.", "9342382": "The nucleus accumbens, a site within the ventral striatum, is best known for its  prominent role in mediating the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse such as cocaine, alcohol, and nicotine. Indeed, it is generally believed that this structure subserves motivated behaviors, such as feeding, drinking, sexual behavior, and exploratory locomotion, which are elicited by natural rewards or incentive stimuli. A basic rule of positive reinforcement is that motor responses will increase in magnitude and vigor if followed by a rewarding event. It is likely, therefore, that the nucleus accumbens may serve as a substrate for reinforcement learning. However, there is surprisingly little information concerning the neural mechanisms by which appetitive responses are learned. In the present study, we report that treatment of the nucleus accumbens core with the selective competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5; 5 nmol/0.5 microl bilaterally) impairs response-reinforcement learning in the acquisition of a simple lever-press task to obtain food. Once the rats learned the task, AP-5 had no effect, demonstrating the requirement of NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity in the early stages of learning. Infusion of AP-5 into the accumbens shell produced a much smaller impairment of learning. Additional experiments showed that AP-5 core-treated rats had normal feeding and locomotor responses and were capable of acquiring stimulus-reward associations. We hypothesize that stimulation of NMDA receptors within the accumbens core is a key process through which motor responses become established in response to reinforcing stimuli. Further, this mechanism, may also play a critical role in the motivational and addictive properties of drugs of abuse.", "9276840": "This article highlights recent discoveries related to the accumbens and closely associated structures, with special reference to their importance in neuropsychiatry. The development of \"striatal patches\" in the accumbens is reviewed in a series of pictures. Neuronal ensembles are discussed as potentially important functional-anatomical units. Attention is also drawn to recent discoveries related to the neuronal circuits that the primate accumbens establishes with the mesencephalic dopamine system. On the basis of histological  and neurochemical differences, the accumbens has been divided into core and shell compartments. In the context of this article, the shell, which is an especially diversified part of the accumbens, is the subject of special attention because of its close relation to the extended amygdala and distinctive response to antipsychotic and psychoactive drugs.", "7870301": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin,  is located within a population of GABAergic interneurons in the neostriatum of the rat. Anatomical studies have revealed that these cells receive asymmetrical synaptic input from terminals that are similar to identified cortical terminals and that they innervate neurons with the ultrastructural features of medium spiny cells. Furthermore, electrophysiological studies suggest that some GABAergic interneurons in the neostriatum receive direct excitatory input from the cortex and inhibit medium spiny cells following cortical stimulation. The main objectives of the present study were (i) to determine whether parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons in the rat receive direct synaptic input from  the cortex, (ii) to determine whether parvalbumin-immunopositive axon terminals innervate identified striatal projection neurons and (iii) to chemically characterize this anatomical circuit at the fine structural level. Rats received  stereotaxic injections of biocytin in the frontal cortex or injections of neurobiotin in the substantia nigra. Following an appropriate survival time, the  animals were perfused and the brains were sectioned and treated to reveal the transported tracers. Sections containing the neostriatum were treated for simultaneous localization of the transported tracer and parvalbumin immunoreactivity. Tracer deposits in the cortex gave rise to massive terminal and fibre labelling in the neostriatum. Parvalbumin-immunoreactive elements located within fields of anterogradely labelled terminals were examined in the electron microscope and corticostriatal terminals were found to form asymmetrical synaptic specializations with all parts of parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons that were examined. Tracer deposits in the substantia nigra produced retrograde labelling of a subpopulation of striatonigral neurons. Areas of the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens containing retrogradely labelled neurons and parvalbumin-immunoreactive structures were selected for electron microscopy. Parvalbumin-immunopositive axon terminals formed symmetrical synaptic specializations with the perikarya of retrogradely labelled medium spiny projection neurons. Postembedding immunocytochemistry for GABA revealed that parvalbumin-immunoreactive boutons in  synaptic contact with medium spiny neurons were GABA-positive. These data demonstrate directly a neural circuit whereby cortical information may be passed  to medium spiny cells, via GABAergic interneurons, in the form of inhibition and  provide an anatomical substrate for the feed-forward inhibition that has been detected in spiny neurons in electrophysiological experiments.", "1701338": "The nucleus accumbens septi (Acb) represents an interface between limbic and motor systems and a site for modulation of these integrative functions by ascending catecholaminergic, principally dopaminergic, axons. This modulatory regulation is most likely attributed to pre- or postsynaptic associations between limbic telencephalic and brainstem afferents. In the present investigation, we examined the ultrastructure and synaptic associations of hippocampal afferents, as well as their relation to catecholaminergic terminals, in the medial Acb of adult rats. Hippocampal afferents were identified by anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) injected in the ventral subiculum, and by anterograde degeneration seen 2-3 days following lesion of the fimbria. Specific comparisons between these methods were made (1) to determine whether similar populations of terminals were labeled and (2) to assess the feasibility of combining degeneration with immunoperoxidase labeling for the  catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Hippocampal afferents labeled with HRP were finely myelinated or unmyelinated and gave rise to small terminals (mean diameter 0.58 micron) containing mostly clear, round vesicles. Of the HRP-labeled terminals which made recognizable junctions, 85% (104/122) formed asymmetric synapses with the heads of dendritic spines. The remainder either formed asymmetric axodendritic synapses or symmetric junctions.  Degenerating terminals were significantly smaller (mean diameter 0.35 micron) than terminals labeled with HRP. However, these also formed principally asymmetric axospinous synapses (89/102, 87%). Whether identified by HRP transport or anterograde degeneration, the hippocampal afferents comprised approximately 10% of all terminals and 30% of all asymmetric axospinous synapses in the medial  Acb. In contrast to hippocampal afferents, TH-labeled terminals formed primarily  symmetric contacts with dendritic shafts and the heads and necks of spines. Quantitative analysis of sections containing both anterograde degeneration and TH-immunoreactivity showed that 25% (26/104) of associations formed by degenerating hippocampal terminals involved convergent inputs with TH-labeled terminals on the same postsynaptic structure. These included dual input either to the same spine head or to different parts of the same dendrite. In addition, the  plasma membranes of hippocampal and TH-labeled terminals were often directly apposed to each other (10/58, 17% of axo-axonal associations formed by degenerating terminals), without recognizable synaptic specializations.(ABSTRACT  TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "15301601": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a role in conditioned place preference (CPP). The authors tested the hypothesis that inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) would inhibit NAc-amphetamine-produced CPP. Results confirmed that NAc amphetamine increased levels of the MAPK extracellular signal-regulated  kinase (ERK). In CPP studies, NAc injections (0.5 microl per side) of the ERK inhibitor PD98059 (1.0-2.5 microg) or the p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 (15-500 ng) dose dependently impaired CPP. The c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 (1.0-2.5 microg) failed to block the CPP effect. The drugs did not block amphetamine-induced motor activity. Results suggest that ERK and p38, but not JNK, MAPKs may be necessary for the establishment of NAc amphetamine-produced CPP and may also mediate other forms of reward-related learning dependent on NAc.", "7796146": "A microdialysis probe was placed in either the shell or core compartment of the nucleus accumbens and rats were exposed to mild footshock.

Drugs induce neural adaptations in this system, including transcriptional, morphological, and synaptic changes, which contribute to the development and expression of drug-related memories and addiction. Previously, it has been reported that sexual experience in male rats,  a natural reward behavior, induces similar neuroplasticity in the mesolimbic system and affects natural reward and drug-related behavior. The current study determined whether sexual experience causes long-lasting changes in mating, or ionotropic glutamate receptor trafficking or function in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), following 3 different reward abstinence periods: 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month after final mating session. Male Sprague Dawley rats mated during 5 consecutive days (sexual experience) or remained sexually na\u00efve to serve as controls. Sexually experienced males displayed facilitation of initiation and performance of mating at each time point. Next, intracellular and membrane surface expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA: NR1 subunit) and \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA: GluA1, GluA2 subunits) receptors in the NAc was determined using a bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS(3)) protein cross-linking assay followed by Western Blot analysis. NR1 expression was increased at 1 day abstinence both at surface and intracellular, but decreased at surface at 1 week of abstinence. GluA2 was increased intracellularly at 1 week and increased at the surface after 1 month of abstinence. Finally, whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings determined reduced AMPA/NMDA ratio of synaptic currents in NAc shell neurons following stimulation of cortical afferents in sexually experienced males after all reward abstinence periods. Together, these data show that sexual experience causes long-term alterations in glutamate receptor expression and function in the NAc. Although not identical, this sex experience-induced neuroplasticity has similarities to that caused by psychostimulants, suggesting common mechanisms for reinforcement of natural and drug reward.", "20655604": "Activation of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens is critical for goal-directed behaviors including cocaine seeking. Studies in cocaine-experienced rodents have revealed three major categories of neuroadaptations that influence the ability of glutamate inputs to activate MSNs: changes in synaptic AMPA receptor levels, changes in extracellular non-synaptic glutamate levels and changes in MSN intrinsic membrane excitability. Most studies have focused on one of these adaptations. This review will consider the possibility that they are causally related and speculate about how time-dependent changes in their interactions may regulate MSN output during early and late withdrawal from repeated cocaine exposure.", "16978593": "The neurobiology of female sexual behavior has largely focused on mechanisms of hormone action on nerve cells and how these effects translate into the display of copulatory motor patterns. Of equal importance, though less studied, are some of  the consequences of engaging in sexual behavior, including the rewarding properties of sexual interactions and how sexual experience alters copulatory efficiency. This review summarizes the effects of sexual experience on reward processes and copulation in female Syrian hamsters. Neural correlates of these sexual interactions include long-term cellular changes in dopamine transmission and postsynaptic signaling pathways related to neuronal plasticity (e.g., dendritic spine formation). Taken together, these studies suggest that sexual experience enhances the reinforcing properties of sexual behavior, which has the  coincident outcome of increasing copulatory efficiency in a way that can increase reproductive success.", "16327783": "The involvement of dopamine within the nucleus accumbens in the formation and maintenance of pair bonds was assessed in a series of experiments using the monogamous prairie vole. We show that dopamine transmission that promotes pair bond formation occurs within the rostral shell of the nucleus accumbens, but not  in its core or caudal shell. Within this specific brain region, D1- and D2-like receptor activation produced opposite effects: D1-like activation prevented pair  bond formation, whereas D2-like activation facilitated it. After extended cohabitation with a female, male voles showed behavior indicative of pair bond maintenance-namely, selective aggression towards unfamiliar females. These voles  also showed a significant upregulation in nucleus accumbens D1-like receptors, and blockade of these receptors abolished selective aggression. Thus, neuroplastic reorganization of the nucleus accumbens dopamine system is responsible for the enduring nature of monogamous pair bonding. Finally, we show  that this system may also contribute to species-specific social organization.", "15452576": "A neurobiological model for pair-bond formation has emerged from studies in monogamous rodents. The neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin contribute to the  processing of social cues necessary for individual recognition. Mesolimbic dopamine is involved in reinforcement and reward learning. Concurrent activation  of neuropeptide and dopamine receptors in the reward centers of the brain during  mating results in a conditioned partner preference, observed as a pair bond. Differential regulation of neuropeptide receptor expression may explain species differences in the ability to form pair bonds. These and other studies discussed  here have intriguing implications for the neurobiology of social attachment in our own species.", "1448200": "Although many workers have appreciated the striking cytologic and neurochemical similarities of neostriatum, accumbens and olfactory tubercle, a compelling case  for regarding these areas as territories in a striatal complex awaited the arguments made by Heimer and his colleagues based on their investigations of connections. A number of recent papers support this viewpoint and extend it with  the characterization of three accumbal subterritories: core, shell and rostral pole. The case for separate classifications of systems traversing the accumbens has become more compelling with each study that demonstrates connectional, cytoarchitectural and neurochemical specificity conforming to the boundaries separating the core and its downstream targets from the shell and its projection  fields. Furthermore, its apparent composite of core-like and shell-like characteristics distinguishes the rostral pole as yet another unique subterritory. Differences in compartmental organization distinguish the accumbens and neostriatum. The available data are consistent with the periventricular and rostrolateral enkephalin-rich zones being ventralmost parts of the neostriatal patch and matrix compartments, respectively. The accumbal cell cluster compartment, on the other hand, appears to be a separate entity, with connectional and neurochemical features that are dissimilar to both patch and matrix of neostriatum. Boundaries between the accumbens and caudate-putamen remain elusive, and the point of view that such boundaries do not exist but, rather, are represented by \"transition zones\" must to a large degree reflect the  reality. Likewise, it is important to acknowledge that the boundaries between accumbal subterritories are not necessarily distinct or observed faithfully by all of the afferent systems. \"Transition zones\" appear to be particularly significant organizational features in rostral and lateral parts of the accumbens. Interestingly, histochemically distinct cell clusters tend to be numerous in boundary regions between adjacent territories and subterritories. The predominant organizational pattern appears to be one in which the core, shell and rostral pole engage different forebrain systems that possibly subserve entirely different functions mediated by distantly related mechanisms. In this regard, it  is of paramount interest that the processing of information conveyed to the accumbens by diverse cortical and subcortical inputs occurs within distinct and perhaps very different dopaminergic environments in the core, shell and rostral pole (e.g., see Refs 24, 34, 90, 110).", "22459871": "Over the past fifty years a significant body of evidence has been compiled suggesting an interaction between the endocannabinoid (EC) system and alcohol dependence. However, much of this work has been conducted only in the past two decades following the elucidation of the molecular constituents of the EC system  that began with the serendipitous discovery of the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1).  Since then, novel pharmacological and genetic tools have enabled researchers to manipulate select components of the EC system, to determine their contribution to the motivation to consume ethanol. From these preclinical studies, it is evident  that CB1 contributes the motivational and reinforcing properties of ethanol, and  chronic consumption of ethanol alters EC transmitter levels and CB1 expression in brain nuclei associated with addiction pathways. These results are augmented by in vitro and ex vivo studies showing that acute and chronic treatment with ethanol produces physiologically relevant alterations in the function of the EC system. This report provides a current and comprehensive review of the literature regarding the interactions between ethanol and the EC system. We begin be reviewing the studies published prior to the discovery of the EC system that compared the behavioral and physiological effects of cannabinoids with ethanol in addition to cross-tolerance between these drugs. Next, a brief overview of the molecular constituents of the EC system is provided as context for the subsequent review of more recent studies examining the interaction of ethanol with the EC system. These results are compiled into a summary providing a scheme for the known changes to the components of the EC system in different stages of alcohol dependence. Finally, future directions for research are discussed.", "11150326": "Despite the role of excitatory transmission to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the actions of most drugs of abuse, the presence and functions of cannabinoid receptors (CB1) on the glutamatergic cortical afferents to the NAc have never been explored. Here, immunohistochemistry has been used to show the localization  of CB1 receptors on axonal terminals making contacts with the NAc GABAergic neurons. Electrophysiological techniques in the NAc slice preparation revealed that cannabimimetics [WIN 55,212,2 (WIN-2) and CP55940] strongly inhibit stimulus-evoked glutamate-mediated transmission. The inhibitory actions of WIN-2  were dose-dependent (EC(50) of 293 +/- 13 nm) and reversed by the selective CB1 antagonist SR 141716A. In agreement with a presynaptic localization of CB1 receptors, WIN-2 increased paired-pulse facilitation, decreased miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency, and had no effect on the mEPSCs amplitude. Perfusion with the  adenylate cyclase activator forskolin enhanced glutamatergic transmission but did not alter presynaptic CB1 actions, suggesting that cannabinoids inhibit glutamate release independently from the cAMP-PKA cascade. CB1 did not reduce evoked transmitter release by inhibiting presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca(2+) currents through N-, L-, or P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels, because CB1 inhibition persisted in  the presence of omega-Conotoxin-GVIA, nimodipine, or omega-Agatoxin-IVA. The K(+) channel blockers 4-aminopyridine (100 micrometer) and BaCl(2) (300 micrometer) each reduced by 40-50% the inhibitory actions of WIN-2, and their effects were additive. These data suggest that CB1 receptors are located on the cortical afferents to the nucleus and can reduce glutamate synaptic transmission within the NAc by modulating K(+) channels activity.", "8627380": "Basal forebrain dopamine (DA) and 5-HT neurotransmission has been implicated in the mediation of the acute reinforcing actions of ethanol. Neuroadaptation theories predict that compensatory changes in neurochemical systems that are activated by alcohol acutely may underlie symptoms of withdrawal after chronic administration. To test this hypothesis, the release of DA and 5-HT was monitored by microdialysis in the nucleus accumbens of dependent male Wistar rats at the end of a 3-5 week ethanol (8.7% w/v) liquid diet regimen, during 8 hr of withdrawal, and during renewed availability of ethanol involving (1) the opportunity to operantly self-administer ethanol (10% w/v) for 60 min, followed by (2) unlimited access to the ethanol-liquid diet. Results were compared to control groups pair-fed with ethanol-free liquid diet and trained to self-administer either ethanol or water. In nondependent rats, operant ethanol self-administration increased both DA and 5-HT release in the NAC. Withdrawal from the chronic ethanol diet produced a progressive suppression in the release of these transmitters over the 8 hr withdrawal period. Self-administration of ethanol reinstated and maintained DA release at prewithdrawal levels but failed to completely restore 5-HT efflux. 5-HT levels recovered rapidly, however, within 1 hr of reexposure to ethanol liquid diet. These findings suggest that deficits in accumbal monoamine release may contribute to the negative affective consequences ethanol withdrawal and, thereby, motivate ethanol-seeking behavior in dependent subjects.", "23719800": "Relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior requires an increase in nucleus accumbens (NAc) core glutamate transmission. Decreased expression of glutamate type I transporter (GLT1), which is responsible for >90% of glutamate clearance, occurs  in the core of rats withdrawn from cocaine self-administration, while treatment with ceftriaxone, a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic previously shown to increase GLT1 expression and function in rodents, upregulates GLT1 and attenuates cue-induced cocaine reinstatement. Here, we tested the effects of increasing GLT1 expression  on cue-induced cocaine seeking in rats exposed to either limited (2 h/d) or extended (6 h/d) cocaine access followed by short (2 d) or long (45 d) withdrawal periods. Treatment with ceftriaxone (200 mg/kg, i.p.) upregulated core GLT1 expression and attenuated cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior only in rats exposed to long withdrawal periods, with a greater effect in the extended-access  condition. Pearson's correlation revealed GLT1 expression in core to be inversely correlated with cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior. To localize the effects of  GLT1 upregulation within NAc, we tested the hypothesis that blockade of GLT1 in NAc core, but not shell, would reverse the ceftriaxone-mediated effect. Rats withdrawn from cocaine self-administration were treated with the same dose of ceftriaxone followed by intracore or intrashell infusions of one of two GLT1 blockers, dihydrokainic acid (500 \u03bcM) or DL-threo-\u03b2-benzyloxyaspartate (250 \u03bcM),  or saline. Our results reveal that the ceftriaxone-mediated attenuation of cue-induced cocaine reinstatement is reversed by GLT1 blockade in core, but not shell, and further implicate core GLT1 as a potential therapeutic target for cocaine relapse.", "22956831": "Decreased basal glutamate levels are observed in the rat nucleus accumbens (NA) core following cocaine self-administration. This disruption of glutamate homeostasis arises from a reduction in the export of glutamate via system x(C)(-) and is accompanied by a decrease in expression of xCT, the catalytic subunit of system x(C)(-). A second hallmark of disrupted homeostasis is a decrease in expression and function of the major glutamate transporter, GLT-1. We have previously shown that chronic treatment with the antibiotic ceftriaxone restores  xCT and GLT-1 expression following cocaine self-administration and attenuates both cue- and cocaine-primed reinstatement. Here we used a (3)H-glutamate uptake  assay and microdialysis to test the hypothesis that ceftriaxone restores the function of both GLT-1 and xCT (glutamate reuptake and export, respectively) in the NA core following cocaine self-administration. We also used electrophysiology to investigate the ability of ceftriaxone to normalize measures of synaptic plasticity following cocaine. We found that 5 d of ceftriaxone treatment following cocaine self-administration restores basal glutamate levels in the accumbens core, likely through an upregulation of system x(C)(-) function. We also found that ceftriaxone restores glutamate reuptake and attenuates the increase in synaptically released glutamate that accompanies cocaine-primed reinstatement. Ceftriaxone also reversed the cocaine-induced synaptic potentiation in the accumbens core, evidenced by normalized spontaneous EPSC amplitude and frequency and evoked EPSC amplitude. These data indicate that ceftriaxone normalizes multiple aspects of glutamate homeostasis following cocaine self-administration and thus holds the potential to reduce relapse in human cocaine addicts.", "22433294": "Cocaine addiction is characterized by compulsive drug seeking, including relapse  after a period of withdrawal. The relapse response requires increased glutamate transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Consistent with this view, glutamate type 1 transporter (GLT1), the transporter responsible for >90% of glutamate uptake, is downregulated in NAc after several days of withdrawal in rats previously trained to self-administer cocaine under limited access conditions (1-2 h/d). Human addiction, however, appears to be better modeled by extending daily drug access (6-8 h/d) and introducing long periods of withdrawal. Here, we  determined the combined effects of manipulating cocaine access and withdrawal on  GLT1 expression in NAc core and shell. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.25 mg per intravenous infusion) in daily limited or extended access sessions for 11 days followed by a period of short (1 day) or long (40-45 days) withdrawal. We found that although cocaine withdrawal decreases GLT1 expression in both core and shell, only in core is GLT1 downregulation sensitive to both access and withdrawal. In fact, after long withdrawal, GLT1 in core is downregulated more than in shell in either the limited or extended access condition. Thus, glutamate regulation in core appears to be a critical factor in  the drug-seeking behavior that follows relatively long periods of cocaine withdrawal.", "21824497": "Ceftriaxone is a beta-lactam antibiotic which has been found to increase the expression and function of the major glutamate transporter, GLT-1. It has previously been shown that GLT-1 expression is decreased in the nucleus accumbens following cocaine self-administration and extinction training; ceftriaxone given  in the days immediately prior to reinstatement testing attenuates both cue- and cocaine-primed reinstatement. Here we tested the ability of ceftriaxone pre-treatment (for 5 days prior to the first cocaine exposure) to prevent the induction of cocaine sensitization and the acquisition of cocaine self-administration. We also tested whether ceftriaxone administered only during  self-administration attenuates the reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking. We found that ceftriaxone did not affect the acquisition of cocaine self-administration but was able to attenuate reinstatement weeks after ceftriaxone administration ceased. This attenuation in reinstatement was accompanied by a restoration of GLT-1 expression in the nucleus accumbens. Ceftriaxone also attenuated locomotor behavior following the first cocaine injection and prevented the induction of cocaine but not caffeine sensitization.  While ceftriaxone-treated animals did not sensitize to caffeine, they displayed reduced caffeine-induced locomotion following repeated caffeine treatment, indicating a possible dopaminergic effect of ceftriaxone. Taken together, these results indicate that ceftriaxone produces enduring changes in glutamate homeostasis in the nucleus accumbens which counteract addiction-related behaviors.", "20649561": "Author information:  (1)The National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research, London, UK. carol.kilkenny@nc3rs.org.uk", "19799712": "Glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase involved in a number of signaling pathways. Previous studies have  demonstrated a role for GSK-3beta in the synaptic plasticity underlying dopamine-associated behaviors and diseases. Drug sensitization is produced by repeated exposure to the drug and is thought to reflect neuroadaptations that contribute to addiction. However, the role of GSK-3beta in cocaine-induced behavior sensitization has not been examined. The present study investigated the  effects of chronic cocaine exposure on GSK-3beta activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and determined whether changes in GSK-3beta activity in the NAc are associated with cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. We also explored whether blockade of GSK-3beta activity in the NAc inhibits the initiation and expression of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization in rats using systemic or brain region-specific administration of the GSK-3beta inhibitors lithium chloride (LiCl) and SB216763. GSK-3beta activity in the NAc core, but not NAc shell, increased after chronic cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) administration. The initiation and expression of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization was attenuated by systemic administration of LiCl (100 mg/kg, i.p.) or direct infusion of SB216763  (1 ng/side) into the NAc core, but not NAc shell. Collectively, these results indicate that GSK-3beta activity in the NAc core, but not NAc shell, mediates the initiation and expression of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization, suggesting  that GSK-3beta may be a potential target for the treatment of cocaine addiction.", "19625514": "Relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior depends on increased glutamate transmission in key regions of the mesocorticolimbic motive circuit, including prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Because GLT1 is responsible for the uptake of >or=90% of extracellular glutamate, we tested the hypothesis that increased GLT1 expression attenuates cocaine relapse. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.125 mg per intravenous infusion) in a lever-pressing task in a daily 2 h session for 10-14 d followed by 5 d of extinction training. Immediately after each extinction session, rats received ceftriaxone (intraperitoneally), a beta-lactam antibiotic believed to increase GLT1 expression, or vehicle. On the following day, presentation of the cue (light and  tone) previously associated with cocaine self-administration reinstated lever pressing in rats treated with vehicle, whereas 100 or 200, but not 50 mg/kg ceftriaxone blocked this response. Immunoblotting confirmed that the ceftriaxone-induced blockade of cocaine relapse was associated with an increase in GLT1 expression in both PFC and NAcc. In separate groups of rats, 200 mg/kg ceftriaxone failed to block cue-induced food seeking, arguing against a ceftriaxone-induced effect unique to extinction training or lever pressing. Our results suggest that glutamate plays a key role in cue-induced relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior, implicating GLT1 as a potential therapeutic target for  cocaine addiction.", "19328817": "Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is a critical mediator of many intracellular signaling systems. The activity of GSK3 is regulated by several kinases, with inactivation occurring via phosphorylation of the inhibitory serine-21 (alpha-isoform) and serine-9 (beta-isoform) residues. Here, we investigated whether acute cocaine administration regulates GSK3 activity and if inhibition of GSK3 by valproate or the selective GSK3 inhibitor SB 216763 would attenuate cocaine-induced behaviors in mice. Mice injected with cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) showed a reduction in the phosphorylation of GSK3beta in the caudate putamen, reflecting an increase in the activity of the kinase. To assess the role of GSK3  in cocaine-induced hyperactivity, mice were pretreated with valproate (50-300 mg/kg, i.p.), SB 216763 (0.25-7.5 mg/kg, i.p.), or the appropriate vehicle prior  to saline or cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.). Valproate or SB 216763 produced significant dose-dependent reductions in cocaine-induced ambulatory and stereotypic activity. Repeated administration of cocaine can result in an augmentation of the locomotor-stimulatory effects of the drug, a phenomenon referred to as sensitization. Mice pretreated with SB 216763 (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to daily cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) for 5 days showed a significant attenuation of the development of cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization following a cocaine challenge on day 13. These results indicate that cocaine activated GSK3beta in the caudate putamen and that pharmacological inhibition of  GSK3 reduced both the acute behavioral responses to cocaine and the long-term neuroadaptations produced by repeated cocaine, therefore suggesting a role for GSK3 in the behavioral and neurochemical manifestations associated with cocaine exposure.", "18675832": "Cortico-striatal glutamate transmission has been implicated in both the initiation and expression of addiction related behaviors, such as locomotor sensitization and drug-seeking. While glutamate transmission onto dopamine cells  in the ventral tegmental area undergoes transient plasticity important for establishing addiction-related behaviors, glutamatergic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens is critical for the expression of these behaviors. This information points to the value of exploring pharmacotherapeutic manipulation of glutamate plasticity in treating drug addiction.", "15635412": "Glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. Inactivation of synaptic glutamate is handled by the glutamate transporter GLT1 (also known as EAAT2; refs 1, 2), the physiologically dominant astroglial protein. In spite of its critical importance in normal and abnormal synaptic activity, no practical pharmaceutical can positively modulate this protein. Animal studies show that the protein is important for normal excitatory synaptic  transmission, while its dysfunction is implicated in acute and chronic neurological disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, brain tumours and epilepsy. Using a blinded screen of 1,040 FDA-approved drugs and nutritionals, we discovered that many beta-lactam antibiotics are potent stimulators of GLT1 expression. Furthermore, this action appears to be mediated through increased transcription of the GLT1 gene. beta-Lactams and various semi-synthetic derivatives are potent antibiotics that act to inhibit bacterial synthetic pathways. When delivered to animals, the beta-lactam ceftriaxone increased both brain expression of GLT1 and its biochemical and functional activity. Glutamate transporters are important in preventing glutamate neurotoxicity. Ceftriaxone was neuroprotective in vitro when used in models of ischaemic injury and motor neuron degeneration, both based in part on glutamate toxicity. When used in an animal model of the fatal disease ALS, the drug delayed loss of neurons and muscle strength, and increased mouse survival. Thus these studies provide a class of potential neurotherapeutics that act to modulate the expression of glutamate neurotransmitter transporters via gene activation.", "26706696": "Using the extinction-reinstatement model of cocaine relapse, we and others have demonstrated that the antibiotic ceftriaxone attenuates cue- and cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine-seeking. Reinstatement is contingent on the release of glutamate in the nucleus accumbens core (NAc) and manipulations that reduce glutamate efflux or block post-synaptic glutamate receptors attenuate reinstatement. We have demonstrated that the mechanism of action by which ceftriaxone attenuates reinstatement involves increased NAc GLT-1 expression and  a reduction in NAc glutamate efflux during reinstatement. Here we investigated the effects of ceftriaxone (100 and 200 mg/kg) on context-primed relapse following abstinence without extinction training and examined the effects of ceftriaxone on GluA1, GluA2 and GLT-1 expression. We conducted microdialysis during relapse to determine if an increase in NAc glutamate accompanies relapse after abstinence and whether ceftriaxone blunts glutamate efflux. We found that both doses of ceftriaxone attenuated relapse. While relapse was accompanied by an increase in NAc glutamate, ceftriaxone (200 mg/kg) was unable to significantly reduce NAc glutamate efflux during relapse despite its ability to upregulate GLT-1. GluA1 was reduced in the NAc by both doses of ceftriaxone while GluA2 expression was unchanged, indicating that ceftriaxone altered AMPA subunit composition following cocaine. Finally, GLT-1 was not altered in the PFC by ceftriaxone. These results indicate that it is possible to attenuate context-primed relapse to cocaine-seeking through modification of post-synaptic receptor properties without attenuating glutamate efflux during relapse. Furthermore, increasing NAc GLT-1 protein expression is not sufficient to attenuate glutamate efflux.", "26068728": "Repeated exposure to psychostimulant drugs such as cocaine or amphetamine can promote drug-seeking and -taking behavior. In rodent addiction models, persistent changes in excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) appear to drive this drug-induced behavioral plasticity. To study whether changes in glutamatergic signaling are shared between or exclusive to specific psychostimulant drugs, we examined synaptic transmission from mice following repeated amphetamine or cocaine administration. Synaptic transmission mediated by AMPA-type glutamate receptors was potentiated in the NAc shell 10-14 days following repeated amphetamine or cocaine treatment. This synaptic enhancement was depotentiated by re-exposure to amphetamine or cocaine. By contrast, in the NAc core only repeated cocaine exposure enhanced synaptic transmission, which was subsequently depotentiated by an additional cocaine but not amphetamine injection during drug abstinence. To better understand the drug-induced depotentiation, we  replicated these in vivo findings using an ex vivo model termed 'challenge in the bath,' and showed that drug-induced decreases in synaptic strength occur rapidly  (within 30 min) and require activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and protein synthesis in the NAc shell, but not NAc core. Overall, these data demonstrate the specificity of neuronal circuit changes induced by amphetamine, introduce a novel method for studying drug challenge-induced plasticity, and define NAc shell medium spiny neurons as a primary site of persistent AMPA-type glutamate receptor plasticity by two widely used psychostimulant drugs.", "24506432": "Emerging evidence indicates that type I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the nucleus accumbens play a critical role in cocaine seeking. The present study sought to determine the role of accumbens core mGluR1, mGluR5 and protein kinase C (PKC) in cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. Here, we show that intra-accumbens core administration of the mGluR1/5 agonist DHPG (250\u2009\u03bcM) promoted cocaine seeking in rats. Consistent with these results, administration of an mGluR1 (50.0\u2009\u03bcM YM 298198) or mGluR5 (9.0\u2009\u03bcM MPEP) antagonist directly into the accumbens core prior to a priming injection of cocaine (10\u2009mg/kg) attenuated the reinstatement of drug seeking. mGluR1/5 stimulation activates a signaling cascade including PKC. Intracore microinjection of PKC inhibitors (10\u2009\u03bcM Ro 31-8220 or 30.0\u2009\u03bcM chelerythrine) also blunted cocaine seeking. In addition, cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking was associated with increased phosphorylation of PKC\u03b3, but not PKC\u03b1 or PKC\u03b2II, in the core. There were no effects of pharmacological inhibition of mGluR1, mGluR5 or PKC in the accumbens core on sucrose seeking. Together, these findings indicate that mGluR1 and mGluR5 activation in the accumbens core promotes cocaine seeking and that these effects are reinforcer specific. Furthermore, stimulation of mGluR1 and mGluR5 in the accumbens core may regulate  cocaine seeking, in part, through activation of PKC\u03b3.", "23986250": "Recent studies indicate a critical role for metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in the reinstatement of cocaine seeking.

Cocaine  seeking previously was linked to increased phosphorylation of GluA2 at Ser880, a  PKC phosphorylation site, which promotes the endocytosis of GluA2-containing AMPA receptors via interactions with Protein Associated with C Kinase (PICK1). The present results indicated that inhibition of PICK1 (100 \u03bcm FSC-231) in the shell  attenuated cocaine seeking. There were no effects of any drug treatment in the shell on sucrose seeking. Together, these findings indicate that accumbens shell  mGluR5 activation promotes cocaine seeking, in part, through activation of PLC and PKC\u03b3. Moreover, the endocytosis of shell GluA2-containing AMPARs during cocaine seeking may depend on interactions with PKC\u03b3 and PICK1.", "23671067": "Nicotine abuse and addiction is a major health liability. Nicotine, an active alkaloid in tobacco, is self-administered by animals and produces cellular adaptations in brain regions associated with drug reward, such as the nucleus accumbens. However, it is unknown whether, akin to illicit drugs of abuse such as cocaine or heroin, the adaptations endure and contribute to the propensity to relapse after discontinuing nicotine use. Using a rat model of cue-induced relapse, we made morphological and electrophysiological measures of synaptic plasticity, as well as quantified glutamate overflow, in the accumbens after 2 wk of withdrawal with extinction training. We found an enduring basal increase in dendritic spine head diameter and in the ratio of AMPA to NMDA currents in accumbens spiny neurons compared with yoked saline animals at 2 wk after the last nicotine self-administration session. This synaptic potentiation was associated with an increase in both AMPA (GluA1) and NMDA (GluN2A and GluN2B) receptor subunits, and a reduction in the glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1). When nicotine seeking was reinstated by presentation of conditioned cues, there were parallel increases in behavioral responding, extracellular glutamate, and further increases in dendritic spine head diameter and ratio of AMPA to NMDA currents within 15 min. These findings suggest that targeting glutamate transmission might inhibit cue-induced nicotine seeking. In support of this hypothesis, we found that pharmacological inhibition of GluN2A with 3-Chloro-4-fluoro-N-[4-[[2-(phenylcarbonyl)hydrazino]carbonyl]benzyl]benzenesulfo namide (TCN-201) or GluN2B with ifenprodil abolished reinstated nicotine seeking. These results indicate that up-regulated GluN2A, GluN2B, and rapid synaptic potentiation in the accumbens contribute to cue-induced relapse to nicotine use.", "23546386": "Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) accumulate in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) after \u223c1 month of withdrawal from a long-access cocaine self-administration regimen (6 h/d, 10d). This is functionally significant because CP-AMPARs mediate  the 'incubated' cue-induced cocaine craving produced by this regimen. Our present goal was to determine if other commonly employed cocaine self-administration regimens also elicit CP-AMPAR accumulation. We compared four regimens, named according to whether sessions were short-access (ShA, 2 h) or long-access (LgA, 6 h) and the total number of sessions: LgA/10d (already shown to elicit CP-AMPAR accumulation), ShA/11d, ShA/20-24d, and LgA/20-24d. In the latter regimens, rats  began with 10 days of ShA and then entered a differential phase (10-14 days) in which ShA sessions either continued or switched to LgA. Controls self-administered saline. After >40 days of withdrawal, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in NAc core medium spiny neurons to assess the contribution of CP-AMPAR transmission, based on the magnitude of synaptic suppression elicited by bath application of the selective CP-AMPAR antagonist naspm (100\u2009\u03bcM). Naspm produced a non-significant (\u223c10%) attenuation of electrically evoked local excitatory postsynaptic current in the saline and ShA groups. By contrast, a significant naspm-induced synaptic attenuation (25-30%) was observed in both the LgA groups. Further analyses indicate that this emergence of CP-AMPAR transmission in the LgA groups is associated with increased baseline responsiveness of MSN to excitatory drive. Together with data on cocaine infusions in each group, our results show that CP-AMPAR accumulation and enhanced glutamate transmission is associated with longer sessions (6 h), rather than the  number of sessions or cocaine infusions.", "23232118": "Medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens serve as the interface between corticolimbic regions that elicit and modulate motivated behaviors, including those related to drugs of abuse, and motor regions responsible for their execution. Medium spiny neurons are excited primarily by AMPA-type glutamate receptors, making AMPA receptor transmission in the accumbens a key regulatory point for addictive behaviors. In animal models of cocaine addiction, changes in  the strength of AMPA receptor transmission onto accumbens medium spiny neurons have been shown to underlie cocaine-induced behavioral adaptations related to cocaine seeking. Here we review changes in AMPA receptor levels and subunit composition that occur after discontinuing different types of cocaine exposure, as well as changes elicited by cocaine reexposure following abstinence or extinction. Signaling pathways that regulate these cocaine-induced adaptations will also be considered, as they represent potential targets for addiction pharmacotherapies.", "22754497": "In animal models of drug addiction, cocaine exposure has been shown to increase levels of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) in two brain regions that  are critical for motivation and reward-the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). This review compares CP-AMPAR plasticity in the two brain regions and addresses its functional significance. In VTA dopamine neurons, cocaine exposure results in synaptic insertion of high conductance CP-AMPARs in exchange for lower conductance calcium-impermeable AMPARs (CI-AMPARs). This plasticity is rapid in onset (hours), GluA2-dependent, and can be observed with a single cocaine injection. Whereas it is short-lived after experimenter-administered cocaine, it persists for months after cocaine self-administration. In addition to strengthening synapses and altering Ca(2+) signaling, CP-AMPAR insertion alters subsequent induction of plasticity at VTA synapses. However, CP-AMPAR insertion is unlikely to mediate the increased DA cell activity that occurs during early withdrawal from cocaine exposure. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) exerts a negative influence on CP-AMPAR accumulation in the VTA. Acutely, mGluR1 stimulation elicits a form of LTD resulting from CP-AMPAR removal and CI-AMPAR insertion. In medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the NAc, extended access cocaine self-administration is required to increase CP-AMPAR levels. This is first detected after approximately  a month of withdrawal and then persists. Once present in NAc synapses, CP-AMPARs  mediate the expression of incubation of cue-induced cocaine craving. The mechanism of their accumulation may be GluA1-dependent, which differs from that observed in the VTA. However, similar to VTA, mGluR1 stimulation removes CP-AMPARs from MSN synapses. Loss of mGluR1 tone during cocaine withdrawal may contribute to CP-AMPAR accumulation in the NAc. Thus, results in both brain regions point to the possibility of using positive modulators of mGluR1 as treatments for cocaine addiction.", "22496525": "Glutamate (Glu) is a major excitatory neurotransmitter, playing a crucial role in the functioning of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical area implicated in somatosensory integration and regulation of motivated behavior. In this study, high-speed amperometry with enzyme-based biosensors was used in freely moving rats to examine changes in extracellular Glu in the NAc shell and core induced by a tone, tail pinch (TP), social interaction with a male conspecific (SI), and intravenous (iv) cocaine (1 mg/kg). To establish the contribution of Glu to electrochemical signal changes, similar recordings were conducted with null (Glu(0)) sensors, which were exposed to the same chemical and physical environment but were insensitive to Glu. TP, SI, and cocaine, but not a tone, induced relatively large and prolonged current increases detected by both Glu and Glu(0) sensors. However, current differentials revealed very rapid, much smaller, and transient increases in extracellular Glu levels, more predominantly in the NAc shell than core. In contrast to monophasic responses with natural stimuli, cocaine induced a biphasic Glu increase in the shell, with a transient peak during the injection and a slower postinjection peak. Therefore, Glu is phasically released in the NAc after exposure to natural arousing stimuli and cocaine; this release is rapid, stimulus dependent, and structure specific, suggesting its role in triggering neural and behavioral activation induced by these stimuli. This study also demonstrates the need for multiple in vitro and in vivo controls to reveal relatively small, highly phasic, and transient fluctuations in Glu levels occurring under behaviorally relevant conditions.", "22414814": "Dopaminergic and glutamatergic inputs to the nucleus accumbens shell have a central role in reward processing. Non-contingent cocaine administration generates a number of long-term AMPA receptor-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy. However, the synaptic consequences of cocaine self-administration and the potential role of dopamine in these processes remain unclear. Here, we examined the influence of D1 dopamine receptor (D1DR) activation on excitatory synaptic plasticity in the accumbens shell of adult rats following cocaine self-administration. Our results indicated that during the first 2 days following cocaine exposure both pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms contribute to a net decrease in AMPA receptor-mediated signaling. This is reflected by decreased frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) attributable to enhanced cannabinoid receptor activity, decreased mEPSC amplitude, and increased paired-pulse ratio of evoked EPSCs. In contrast, the only changes observed in the shell 3-4 weeks following cocaine self-administration were increased mEPSCs amplitudes and AMPA/NMDA ratios. We further found that although these cocaine-induced neuroadaptations during early and late abstinence have different synaptic expression mechanisms, they were normalized by stimulation of D1DRs. Thus, pre-exposure to the D1DR agonist, SKF38393, during the initial period of abstinence increased excitatory synaptic strength, but reduced excitatory signaling after weeks of abstinence. Taken together, these results indicate that  the direction of changes in excitatory transmission induced by cocaine self-administration switches over the first few weeks of abstinence. Moreover, D1DRs gate the stability of these cocaine-induced changes at glutamatergic synapses in the accumbens shell by utilizing multiple temporally distinct mechanisms, which has implications for the treatment of cocaine craving and addiction.", "22388870": "Neuroadaptations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are associated with the development of drug addiction. Plasticity in synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability of NAc medium spiny neurons (MSNs) play critical roles in addiction  induced by different classes of abused drugs. However, it is unknown whether morphine exposure influences synaptic strength, intrinsic excitability or both in NAc. Here we show that chronic withdrawal (10 days after the last injection) from repeated morphine exposure elicited potentiation in both glutamatergic synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability of MSNs in NAc shell (NAcSh). The potentiation of synaptic strength was demonstrated by an increase in the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), a decrease in the paired-pulse ratio (PPR), and an increase in the ratio of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPAR)- to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR)-mediated currents. The potentiation of intrinsic excitability was mediated by inhibition of the sustained potassium currents via extrasynaptic NMDAR activation. The function of the presynaptic group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3) was downregulated, enhancing the probability of glutamate release on synaptic terminals during chronic morphine withdrawal. Pretreatment with the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 completely blocked potentiation of both synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability. These  results suggest that chronic morphine withdrawal downregulates mGluR2/3 to induce potentiation of MSN glutamatergic synapse via increased glutamate release, leading to potentiation of intrinsic excitability. Such potentiation of both synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability might contribute to neuroadaptations induced by morphine application.", "22084102": "Persistent relapse to addictive drugs constitutes the most challenging problem in addiction therapy, and is linked to impaired prefrontal cortex regulation of motivated behaviors involving the nucleus accumbens. Using a rat model of heroin  addiction, we show that relapse requires long-term potentiation (LTP)-like increases in synaptic strength in the prefrontal cortex projection to the nucleus accumbens. The increased synaptic strength was paralleled by dendritic spine enlargement in accumbens spiny neurons and required up-regulated surface expression of NMDA2b-containing receptors (NR2B). Accordingly, blocking NR2B before reinstating heroin-seeking prevented the induction of LTP-like changes in  spine remodeling and synaptic strength, and inhibited heroin relapse. These data  show that LTP-like neuroplasticity in prefrontal-accumbens synapses is initiated  by NR2B stimulation and strongly contributes to heroin relapse. Moreover, the data reveal NR2B-containing NMDA receptors as a previously unexplored therapeutic target for treating heroin addiction.", "21971065": "The publication of the psychomotor stimulant theory of addiction in 1987 and the  finding that addictive drugs increase dopamine concentrations in the rat mesolimbic system in 1988 have led to a predominance of psychobiological theories that consider addiction to opiates and addiction to psychostimulants as essentially identical phenomena. Indeed, current theories of addiction - hedonic  allostasis, incentive sensitization, aberrant learning and frontostriatal dysfunction - all argue for a unitary account of drug addiction. This view is challenged by behavioural, cognitive and neurobiological findings in laboratory animals and humans. Here, we argue that opiate addiction and psychostimulant addiction are behaviourally and neurobiologically distinct and that the differences have important implications for addiction treatment, addiction theories and future research.", "21764143": "It was suggested in 1986 that cue-induced drug craving in cocaine addicts progressively increases over the first several weeks of abstinence and remains high for extended periods. During the past decade, investigators have identified  an analogous incubation phenomenon in rodents, in which time-dependent increases  in cue-induced drug seeking are observed after withdrawal from intravenous cocaine self-administration. Such an incubation of drug craving is not specific to cocaine, as similar findings have been observed after self-administration of heroin, nicotine, methamphetamine and alcohol in rats. In this review, we discuss recent results that have identified important brain regions involved in the incubation of drug craving, as well as evidence for the underlying cellular mechanisms. Understanding the neurobiology of the incubation of drug craving in rodents is likely to have significant implications for furthering understanding of brain mechanisms and circuits that underlie craving and relapse in human addicts.", "21329910": "BACKGROUND: Excitatory synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulates the reinstatement of drug seeking, an animal model of relapse in human  drug addicts. However, the functional adaptations at NAc synapses that mediate reinstatement are not clearly understood. METHODS: We assessed the behavioral responses of mice to cocaine administration by measuring locomotor stimulation and the acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of conditioned place preference. Synaptic function was then examined by preparing acute brain slices and performing whole cell voltage-clamp  recordings from individual medium spiny neurons in the NAc shell. RESULTS: We find that reduced excitatory synaptic strength in the NAc shell is a  common functional adaptation induced by multiple experiences known to cause reinstatement, including stress and drug re-exposure. The same synaptic adaptation is observed shortly after reinstatement of conditioned place preference by a cocaine priming injection. CONCLUSIONS: This common synaptic modification associated with stress, drug re-exposure, and reinstatement defines a potential synaptic gateway to relapse.", "21173236": "Cocaine addiction remains without an effective pharmacotherapy and is characterized by an inability of addicts to inhibit relapse to drug use. Vulnerability to relapse arises from an enduring impairment in cognitive control  of motivated behavior, manifested in part by dysregulated synaptic potentiation and extracellular glutamate homeostasis in the projection from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens. Here we show in rats trained to self-administer  cocaine that the enduring cocaine-induced changes in synaptic potentiation and glutamate homeostasis are mechanistically linked through group II metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling. The enduring cocaine-induced changes in measures of cortico-accumbens synaptic and glial transmission were restored to predrug parameters for at least 2 wk after discontinuing chronic treatment with the cystine prodrug, N-acetylcysteine. N-acetylcysteine produced these changes by inducing an enduring restoration of nonsynaptic glutamatergic tone onto metabotropic glutamate receptors. The long-lasting pharmacological restoration of cocaine-induced glutamatergic adaptations by chronic N-acetylcysteine also caused enduring inhibition of cocaine-seeking in an animal model of relapse. These data  mechanistically link nonsynaptic glutamate to cocaine-induced adaptations in excitatory transmission and demonstrate a mechanism to chronically restore prefrontal to accumbens transmission and thereby inhibit relapse in an animal model.", "21150906": "Chronic methamphetamine (meth) abuse can lead to persisting cognitive deficits. Here, we utilized a long-access meth self-administration (SA) protocol to assess  recognition memory and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) expression, and the possible reversal of cognitive impairments with the mGluR5 allosteric modulator, 3-cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl) benzamide (CDPPB). Male, Long-Evans rats self-administered i.v. meth (0.02\u2009mg/infusion) on an FR1 schedule of reinforcement or received yoked-saline infusions. After seven daily 1-h sessions, rats were switched to 6-h daily sessions for 14 days, and then underwent drug abstinence. Rats were tested for object recognition memory at 1 week after meth SA at 90\u2009min and 24\u2009h retention intervals. In a separate experiment, rats underwent the same protocol, but received either vehicle or CDPPB (30\u2009mg/kg) after familiarization. Rats were killed on day 8 or 14 post-SA and brain tissue was obtained. Meth intake escalated over the extended access period. Additionally, meth-experienced rats showed deficits in both short- and long-term recognition memory, demonstrated by a lack of novel object exploration. The deficit at 90\u2009min was reversed by CDPPB treatment. On day 8, meth intake during SA negatively correlated with mGluR expression in the perirhinal and prefrontal cortex, and mGluR5 receptor expression was decreased 14 days after discontinuation of meth. This effect was specific to mGluR5 levels in the perirhinal cortex, as no differences were identified in the hippocampus or in mGluR2/3 receptors. These results from a clinically-relevant animal model of addiction suggest that mGluR5 receptor modulation may be a potential treatment of cognitive dysfunction in meth addiction.", "21054692": "Relapse is one of the most problematic aspects in the treatment of alcoholism and is often triggered by alcohol-associated environmental cues. Evidence indicates that glutamate neurotransmission plays a critical role in cue-induced relapse-like behavior, as inhibition of glutamate neurotransmission can prevent reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior. However, few studies have examined specific changes in extracellular glutamate levels in discrete brain regions produced by exposure to alcohol-associated cues. The purpose of this study was to use glutamate oxidase (GluOx)-coated biosensors to monitor changes in extracellular glutamate in specific brain regions during cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior. Male Wistar rats were implanted with indwelling jugular vein catheters and intracerebral guide cannula aimed at the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, and then trained to self-administer alcohol intravenously. A separate group of animals were trained to self-administer food pellets. Each reinforcer was accompanied by the presentation of a light/tone stimulus. Following stabilization of responding for  alcohol or food reinforcement, and subsequent extinction training, animals were implanted with pre-calibrated biosensors and then underwent a 1-hour cue-induced  reinstatement testing period. As determined by GluOx-coated biosensors, extracellular levels of glutamate were increased in the BLA and NAc core during cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior. The cumulative change in extracellular glutamate in both regions was significantly greater for cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol-seeking behavior versus that of food-seeking behavior. These results indicate that increases in glutamate transmission in the BLA and NAc core may be a neurochemical substrate of cue-evoked alcohol-seeking behavior.", "20624588": "Experience-dependent plasticity at excitatory synapses of the mesocorticolimbic system is a fundamental brain mechanism that enables adaptation to an ever-changing environment. These synaptic responses are critical for the planning and execution of adaptive behaviors that maximize survival. The mesocorticolimbic system mediates procurement of positive reinforcers such as food and sex; however, drugs of abuse resculpt this crucial circuitry to promote compulsive drug-seeking behavior. This review will discuss the long-term changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission that occur within the mesolimbic system following cocaine exposure. In addition, we will examine how these long-lasting neuroadaptations may drive the pathology of psychostimulant addiction. Finally, we review clinical trials that highlight antagonists at excitatory AMPA receptors as promising targets against cocaine abuse.", "20371237": "Glutamate plays a pivotal role in regulating drug self-administration and drug-seeking behavior, and the past decade has witnessed a substantial surge of interest in the role of Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu(1) and mGlu(5) receptors) in mediating these behaviors. As will be reviewed here, Group  I mGlu receptors are involved in normal and drug-induced synaptic plasticity, drug reward, reinforcement and relapse-like behaviors, and addiction-related cognitive processes such as maladaptive learning and memory, behavioral inflexibility, and extinction learning. Animal models of addiction have revealed  that antagonists of Group I mGlu receptors, particularly the mGlu(5) receptor, reduce self-administration of virtually all drugs of abuse. Since inhibitors of mGlu5 receptor function have now entered clinical trials for other medical conditions and appear to be well-tolerated, a key question that remains unanswered is - what changes in cognition are produced by these compounds that result in reduced drug intake and drug-seeking behavior? Finally, in contrast to  mGlu(5) receptor antagonists, recent studies have indicated that positive allosteric modulation of mGlu(5) receptors actually enhances synaptic plasticity  and improves various aspects of cognition, including spatial learning, behavioral flexibility, and extinction of drug-seeking behavior. Thus, while inhibition of Group I mGlu receptor function may reduce drug reward, reinforcement, and relapse-related behaviors, positive allosteric modulation of the mGlu5 receptor subtype may actually enhance cognition and potentially reverse some of the cognitive deficits associated with chronic drug use.", "19924109": "alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate receptor (AMPAR) surface expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is enhanced after withdrawal from repeated cocaine exposure. However, it is unclear whether this contributes to the expression of locomotor sensitization and whether similar changes can be observed in other striatal regions. In this study we examined the relationship between AMPAR surface expression in the NAc and locomotor sensitization. We also examined AMPAR distribution in the dorsolateral striatum (DS) and NMDA receptor (NMDAR) distribution in the NAc and DS. Trends but no significant changes in NMDAR distribution were found in the NAc after withdrawal. No NMDAR changes were observed in the DS. AMPAR surface expression was increased in the NAc 15 days after the last exposure to cocaine, but decreased in the DS. Re-exposure to cocaine on withdrawal day 14 decreased AMPAR surface expression in the NAc 24 h,  but not 30 min, after challenge, but increased it in the DS 24 h and 30 min after challenge. Locomotor sensitization was evaluated at times associated with increased or decreased AMPAR surface expression in the NAc. The magnitude of sensitization did not vary with changes in the level of AMPAR surface expression, nor was it significantly reduced by decreasing AMPAR transmission through intra-NAc infusion of CNQX before cocaine challenge. On the basis of our results, and other findings, we suggest that the expression of sensitization has no clear  relationship to altered AMPAR surface expression in the NAc, although the latter  may have a role in the enhanced pursuit and self-administration of drugs observed in sensitized rats.", "19630739": "There is now compelling evidence that the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter  glutamate plays a pivotal role in drug addiction and alcoholism. As a result, there has been increasing interest in developing glutamate-based therapies for the treatment of addictive disorders. Receptors for glutamate are primarily divided into two classes: ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) that mediate fast excitatory glutamate transmission, and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which are G-protein coupled receptors that mediate slower, modulatory glutamate transmission. Most iGluR antagonists, while showing some efficacy in animal models of addiction, exhibit serious side effects when tested in humans. mGluR ligands, on the other hand, which have been advanced to testing in clinical trials for various medical conditions, have demonstrated the ability to reduce drug reward, reinforcement, and relapse-like behaviors in animal studies. mGluR ligands that have been shown to be primarily effective are Group I (mGluR1 and mGluR5) negative allosteric modulators and Group II (mGluR2 and mGluR3) orthosteric presynaptic autoreceptor agonists. In this review, we will summarize  findings from animal studies suggesting that these mGluR ligands may be of potential benefit in reducing on-going drug self-administration and may aid in the prevention of relapse. The neuroanatomical distribution of mGluR1, mGluR2/3,  and mGluR5 receptors and the pharmacological properties of Group I negative allosteric modulators and Group II agonists will also be overviewed. Finally, we  will discuss the current status of mGluR ligands in human clinical trials.", "19597494": "Addictive drugs hijack mechanisms of learning and memory that normally underlie reinforcement of natural rewards and induce synaptic plasticity of glutamatergic  transmission in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system. In the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a single exposure to cocaine efficiently triggers NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity in DA neurons, whereas plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) occurs only after repeated injections. Whether these two  forms of plasticity are independent or hierarchically organized remains unknown.  We combined ex vivo electrophysiology in acute brain slices with behavioral assays modeling drug relapse in mice and found that the duration of the cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity in the VTA is gated by mGluR1. Overriding mGluR1 in vivo made the potentiation in the VTA persistent. This led to synaptic  plasticity in the NAc, which contributes to cocaine-seeking behavior after protracted withdrawal. Impaired mGluR1 function in vulnerable individuals could represent a first step in the recruitment of the neuronal network that underlies  drug addiction.", "19274089": "Precise identification of neuronal populations is a major challenge in neuroscience. In the striatum, more than 95% of neurons are GABAergic medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs), which form two intermingled populations distinguished by their projections and protein content. Those expressing dopamine D(1)-receptors (D1Rs) project preferentially to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), whereas those expressing dopamine D(2)- receptors (D2Rs) project preferentially to the lateral part of the globus pallidus (LGP). The degree of segregation of these populations has been a continuous subject of debate, and the recent introduction of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice expressing fluorescent proteins driven by specific promoters was  a major progress to facilitate striatal neuron identification. However, the fraction of MSNs labeled in these mice has been recently called into question, casting doubt on the generality of results obtained with such approaches. Here, we performed an in-depth quantitative analysis of striatal neurons in drd1a-EGFP  and drd2-EGFP mice. We first quantified neuronal and non-neuronal populations in  the striatum, based on nuclear staining with TO-PRO-3, and immunolabeling for NeuN, DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr approximately 32,000), and various markers for interneurons. TO-PRO-3 staining was sufficient to identify MSNs by their typical nuclear morphology and, with a good probability, interneuron populations. In drd1a-EGFP/drd2-EGFP double transgenic mice all MSNs expressed EGFP, which was driven in about half of them by drd1a promoter. Retrograde labeling showed that all MSNs projecting to the SNr expressed D1R and very few D2R (<1%). In contrast, our results were compatible with the existence of some D1R-EGFP-expressing fibers giving off terminals in the LGP. Thus, our study shows that nuclear staining is a simple method for identifying MSNs and other striatal neurons. It also unambiguously confirms the degree of segregation of MSNs in the mouse striatum and allows the full exploitation of results obtained with BAC-transgenic mice.", "19157986": "The importance of glutamate in the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior has  been established. New molecular and neurochemical adaptations in the glutamatergic system which drive cocaine relapse have been identified, such as the ability of CB1 receptor stimulation to reduce basal glutamate levels and the  involvement of the GluR1 receptor subunit in reinstatement. Furthermore, it is apparent that similar glutamatergic neuroadaptations arise after self-administration of cocaine, heroin, nicotine, and alcohol. For example, reinstatement to cocaine, nicotine, and alcohol can be prevented both by the stimulation of group II mGluR receptors and by the blockade of group I mGluR receptors. The similarities in the neurochemistry behind relapse to these varied  drug classes indicate that drugs that target the glutamate system could be effective at treating relapse to multiple types of drugs.", "19105975": "Glutamatergic signaling plays an important role in the behavioral and molecular plasticity observed in behavioral sensitization to cocaine. Redistribution of the glutamate receptors in the synaptosomal membrane fraction was investigated in the nucleus accumbens, dorsolateral striatum, and ventral tegmental area at 1 or 21 days of withdrawal in behaviorally sensitized rats. At 1 day of withdrawal, there were no changes in either tissue level or redistribution of glutamate receptors in nucleus accumbens core and shell and ventral tegmental area. At 21 days of withdrawal, there was a decrease in the expression of mGluR2/3 protein in core and shell, an increase in GluR1 and a decrease in Homer1b/c proteins in the nucleus accumbens core tissue. In dorsolateral striatum, the tissue level of NMDAR2B protein was increased. Moreover, there was an augmented presence of AMPA  (GluR1, GluR2), NMDA (NMDAR1, 2A, 2B), and group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5) proteins in the synaptosomal fraction in core and shell of the  nucleus accumbens. There was also an increase in synaptosomal mGluR2/3 protein in nucleus accumbens core. The redistribution of glutamate receptors was selective for nucleus accumbens since no changes were observed in the dorsolateral striatum and ventral tegmental area. While the tissue level of the Homer1b/c protein was selectively reduced in nucleus accumbens core, that of PSD95, PICK1, and actin was not changed in any of the brain regions examined. However, the synaptosomal membrane fraction level of Homer1b/c and PSD95 was increased in nucleus accumbens core and shell, with no changes in PICK1, and a decrease in actin protein. These  observations suggest that significant redistribution of glutamate receptors and postsynaptic scaffolding proteins into synaptosomal membrane fraction is associated with withdrawal from behavioral sensitization to cocaine.", "18945913": "A growing body of evidence indicates that enhanced AMPA-mediated glutamate transmission in the core of the nucleus accumbens is critically involved in cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking, an animal model of relapse. However, the extent to which increased glutamate transmission in the other major subregion of the nucleus accumbens, the shell, contributes to the reinstatement of cocaine seeking remains unclear. In the present experiments, administration of the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX (0, 0.03, or 0.3 mug) into either the core or the shell of the nucleus accumbens before a systemic cocaine priming injection (10 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently attenuated the reinstatement of drug seeking. Cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking also was associated with increases in GluR2-pSer880 in the nucleus accumbens shell. The phosphorylation of GluR2 by PKC at Ser880 plays an important role in the trafficking of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors from the plasma membrane. The current results showed that administration of a cell-permeable peptide that disrupts GluR2 trafficking (Pep2-EVKI) into either the accumbens core or shell attenuated cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. Together, these findings indicate that changes in AMPA receptor-mediated glutamate transmission in both the nucleus accumbens core and shell are necessary for the reinstatement of drug seeking induced by a priming injection of cocaine. The present results also demonstrate that the reinstatement of cocaine seeking is associated with increases in the phosphorylation-dependent trafficking of GluR2-containing AMPA receptors in the nucleus accumbens.", "18294632": "The nucleus accumbens (Acb) is an extensively studied neuroanatomical substrate of opiate reward and the neural plasticity associated with chronic opioid use. The cellular mechanisms mediating opioid-dependent plasticity are uncertain, however AMPA-type glutamate receptor trafficking in dopamine D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) expressing neurons may be a potential cellular pathway for these adaptations, although there is no evidence for this possibility. Immunogold electron microscopy was used to quantify the surface expression of the AMPA GluR1 subunit in dendritic profiles of neurons in the Acb in response to intermittent 14-day non-contingent injections of escalating doses of morphine, a model that parallels opioid self-administration. To determine if changes in GluR1 trafficking occurred in neurons potentially sensitive to dopamine-induced D1R activation, immunoperoxidase labeling of D1R was combined with immunogold labeling of GluR1. Immunogold quantification was performed in two distinct Acb subregions, the shell, an area involved in processing incentive salience related  to rewarding stimuli, and the core, an area involved in reward-seeking behaviors. We provide the first report that chronic morphine administration is associated with a receptor-phenotypic decrease in surface trafficking of GluR1 in Acb subregions. When compared to saline injected animals, morphine produced a decrease in plasma membrane GluR1 labeling in medium- and large-sized D1R expressing dendritic profiles in the Acb shell. In contrast, in the Acb core, surface GluR1 was decreased in small-sized dendrites that did not express the dopamine receptor. These results indicate that chronic intermittent injection of  escalating doses of morphine is accompanied by ultrastructural plasticity of GluR1 in neurons that are responsive to glutamate and dopamine-induced D1R activation in the Acb shell, and neurons capable of responding to glutamate but not D1R receptor stimulation in the Acb core. Thus, AMPA receptor trafficking associated with chronic opiate exposure in functionally distinct areas of the Acb may be distinguished by D1R receptor activation, suggesting the potential for differing neural substrates of reward and motor aspects of addictive processes involving glutamate and dopamine signaling.", "18061358": "Reinstatement of extinguished drug-seeking has been utilized in the study of the  neural substrates of relapse to drugs of abuse, particularly cocaine. However, limited studies have examined the circuitry that drives the reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior in the presence of conditioned cues, or by heroin itself. In order to test the hypothesis that the circuitry underlying reinstatement in heroin-experienced animals would show overlapping, yet distinct differences from  cocaine-experienced animals, we used transient inhibition of several cortical, striatal, and limbic brain regions during reinstatement of heroin-seeking produced by heroin-paired cues, or by a single priming dose of heroin. Rats lever pressed for i.v. heroin discretely paired with a conditioned stimulus (CS) during daily 3-h sessions for a period of 2 weeks, followed by daily extinction of lever responding. Subsequent reinstatement of heroin-seeking was measured as lever responding in the absence of heroin reinforcement. The first set of reinstatement tests involved response-contingent CS presentations following bilateral intracranial infusion of either a combination of GABA receptor agonists (baclofen-muscimol, B/M) or vehicle (saline) into one of 13 different brain regions. The second set of reinstatement tests involved a single heroin injection (0.25 mg/kg, s.c.) following either B/M or vehicle infusions. Our results showed  that vehicle-infused animals reinstated to both CS presentations and a priming injection of heroin, while B/M inactivation of several areas known to be important for the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking also attenuated heroin-seeking in response to CS presentations and/or a priming dose of heroin. However, as predicted, inactivation of areas previously shown to not affect cocaine-seeking significantly attenuated heroin-seeking, supporting the hypothesis that the circuitry underlying the reinstatement of heroin-seeking is more diffusely distributed than that for cocaine.", "17948030": "Addiction is caused, in part, by powerful and long-lasting memories of the drug experience. Relapse caused by exposure to cues associated with the drug experience is a major clinical problem that contributes to the persistence of addiction. Here we present the accumulated evidence that drugs of abuse can hijack synaptic plasticity mechanisms in key brain circuits, most importantly in  the mesolimbic dopamine system, which is central to reward processing in the brain. Reversing or preventing these drug-induced synaptic modifications may prove beneficial in the treatment of one of society's most intractable health problems.", "17805308": "Using addictive drugs can evolve from controlled social use into the compulsive relapsing disorder that characterizes addiction. This transition to addiction results from genetic, developmental, and sociological vulnerabilities, combined with pharmacologically induced plasticity in brain circuitry that strengthens learned drug-associated behaviors at the expense of adaptive responding for natural rewards. Advances over the last decade have identified the brain circuits most vulnerable to drug-induced changes, as well as many associated molecular and morphological underpinnings. This growing knowledge has contributed to an expanded understanding of how drugs usurp normal learning circuitry to create the pathology of addiction, as evidenced by involuntary activation of reward circuits in response to drug-associated cues and simultaneous reports of drug craving. This new understanding provides unprecedented potential opportunities for novel pharmacotherapeutic targets in treating addiction. There appears to be plasticity associated with the addiction phenomenon in general as well as changes produced by addiction to a specific class of addicting drugs. These findings also provide  the basis for the current understanding of addiction as a chronic, relapsing disease of the brain with changes that persist long after the last use of the drug. Here, we describe the neuroplasticity in brain circuits and cell function induced by addictive drugs that is thought to underlie the compulsions to resume  drug-taking, and discuss how this knowledge is impelling exploration and testing  of novel addiction therapies.", "17719565": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies show that the acute administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibits the desire for cocaine in addicts and cocaine-seeking in animals. METHODS: Rats were trained to self-administer heroin, and the reinstatement model of drug seeking was used to determine whether chronic NAC treatment inhibited heroin-seeking. RESULTS: Daily NAC administration inhibited cue- and heroin-induced seeking. Moreover, repeated NAC administration during extinction training reduced extinction-responding and inhibited cue- and heroin-induced reinstatement for up  to 40 days after discontinuing daily NAC injection. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that daily NAC inhibits heroin-induced reinstatement and produces an enduring reduction in cue- and heroin-induced drug seeking for over 1 month after the last injection of NAC. Both the inhibitory effect of NAC on the reinstatement of heroin-seeking and the ability of NAC to reduce extinction-responding support clinical evaluation of repeated NAC administration  to decrease in drug-seeking in heroin addicts.", "17347848": "RATIONALE: Nucleus accumbens glutamate transmission has been implicated in drug-seeking behavior, but the involvement of glutamate receptor subtypes in drug seeking maintained by drug-associated cues has not been fully investigated. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and mGlu5 receptor blockade in the nucleus accumbens  core on cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. METHOD: Wistar rats were trained to self-administer cocaine and associate a compound stimulus (light and tone) with the drug under an FR4(FR5:S) second-order schedule of reinforcement. After extinction, during which neither cocaine nor the compound stimulus was available, responding was reinstated by contingent presentations of the compound stimulus. The effects of the intra-accumbal AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitro-quinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX; 0, 0.01, and 0.03 microg/side), the NMDA antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate  (D-AP5; 0, 1, and 2 microg/side), and the mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP; 0, 0.5, and 1 microg/side) on reinstatement were examined in a within-subjects design. RESULTS: CNQX and D-AP5 attenuated cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking dose-dependently. MPEP, however, decreased cocaine seeking only relative to baseline because also the saline vehicle included in the within-subjects series of injections decreased responding, possibly reflecting conditioned anhedonic effects of MPEP. In additional experiments, none of the antagonists attenuated locomotor activity or responding for sucrose pellets. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking after a period of withdrawal from cocaine is sensitive to AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptor antagonism in the nucleus accumbens core and give further evidence for the role of the accumbal glutamate transmission in modulation of drug-seeking behavior.", "17275103": "AMPA receptors mediate fast synaptic transmission at excitatory synapses in the CNS and are crucial during neuronal development, synaptic plasticity and structural remodeling. AMPA receptors lacking GluR2 subunits are permeable to Ca(2+) and Zn(2+). Ca(2+) permeation through AMPA receptors is crucial in several forms of synaptic plasticity and cell death associated with neurological diseases and disorders. The subunit composition and Ca(2+) permeability of AMPA receptors  are not static, but they are dynamically remodeled in a cell- and synapse-specific manner during development and in response to neuronal activity,  sensory experience and neuronal insults. Exciting new research shows that these changes arise not only because of regulated expression of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2, but also as a consequence of RNA editing, receptor trafficking and dendritic protein synthesis. This article reviews new insights into the role of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors in neuronal function and survival.", "16491081": "A major challenge in systems neuroscience is to perform precise molecular genetic analyses of a single neuronal population in the context of the complex mammalian  brain. Existing technologies for profiling cell type-specific gene expression are largely limited to immature or morphologically identifiable neurons. In this study, we developed a simple method using fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to purify genetically labeled neurons from juvenile and adult mouse brains for gene expression profiling. We identify and verify a new set of differentially expressed genes in the striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, two functionally and clinically important projection neuron subtypes in the basal ganglia. We further demonstrate that Ebf1 is a lineage-specific transcription factor essential to the differentiation of striatonigral neurons. Our study provides a general approach for profiling cell type-specific gene expression in the mature mammalian brain and identifies a set of genes critical to the function and dysfunction of the striatal projection neuron circuit.", "16000629": "Withdrawal from chronic cocaine reduces extracellular glutamate levels in the nucleus accumbens by decreasing cystine/glutamate exchange (xc-). Activating xc-  with N-acetylcysteine restores extracellular glutamate and prevents cocaine-induced drug seeking. It was hypothesized that the activation of xc- prevents drug seeking by increasing glutamatergic tone on presynaptic group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3) and thereby inhibiting excitatory transmission. In the first experiment, the capacity of glutamate derived from xc- to regulate excitatory transmission via mGluR2/3 was determined. Physiological levels of cystine (100-300 nm) were restored to acute tissue slices from the nucleus accumbens or prefrontal cortex. Cystine increased glutamate efflux and decreased miniature EPSC (mEPSC) and spontaneous EPSC (sEPSC) frequency as well as evoked EPSC amplitude. These effects of cystine were presynaptic, because there was no change in mEPSC or sEPSC amplitude, and an increase in the evoked EPSC paired-pulse facilitation ratio. The cystine-induced reduction in EPSCs was  reversed by blocking either xc- or mGluR2/3. In the second experiment, blocking mGluR2/3 prevented the ability of N-acetylcystine to inhibit the reinstatement of drug seeking in rats trained to self-administer cocaine. These data demonstrate that nonsynaptic glutamate derived from xc- modulates synaptic glutamate release  and thereby regulates cocaine-induced drug seeking.", "15908948": "Goal-directed behavior is believed to involve interactions of prefrontal cortical and limbic inputs in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and their modulation by mesolimbic dopamine (DA) seems to be of primary importance in NAcc function. Using in vivo electrophysiological recordings simultaneously with DA system manipulation in rats, we show that tonic and phasic DA release selectively modulates hippocampal and prefrontal cortical inputs through D1 and D2 receptors, respectively. In addition, we also found that D1 activation and D2 inactivation in the NAcc produced behaviorally selective effects (learning versus set shifting of response strategy) that correspond to specific afferents. These results suggest that the dynamics of DA release regulate the balance between limbic and cortical drive through activation and inactivation of DA receptor subtypes in the accumbens, and this regulates goal-directed behavior.", "15464139": "Using a rat model of drug craving and relapse, we recently found that cocaine seeking induced by re-exposure to drug-associated cues progressively increases over the first 2 months after withdrawal from cocaine self-administration, suggesting that drug craving incubates over time [Nature 412 (2001) 141]. Here, we summarize data from studies that further characterized this incubation phenomenon and briefly discuss its implications for drug addiction. The main findings of our ongoing research are: 1. Incubation of cocaine craving is long-lasting, but not permanent: cocaine seeking induced by exposure to cocaine cues remains elevated for up to 3 months of withdrawal, but decreases after 6 months. 2. Incubation of reward craving is not drug specific: sucrose seeking induced by re-exposure to the reward cues also increases after withdrawal, but for a time period that is shorter than that of cocaine. 3. Incubation of cocaine  craving is not evident after acute re-exposure to cocaine itself: cocaine seeking induced by cocaine priming injections remains essentially unchanged over the first 6 months of withdrawal. 4. Incubation of cocaine craving after withdrawal is associated with increases in the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mesolimbic dopamine areas.", "12787079": "Cocaine self-administration is associated with a propensity to relapse in humans  and reinstatement of drug seeking in rats after prolonged withdrawal periods. These behaviors are hypothesized to be mediated by molecular neuroadaptations within the mesolimbic dopamine system. However, in most studies of drug-induced neuroadaptations, cocaine was experimenter-delivered and molecular measurements were performed after short withdrawal periods. In the present study, rats were trained to self-administer intravenous cocaine or oral sucrose (a control non-drug reward) for 10 days (6-h/day) and were killed following 1, 30, or 90 days of reward withdrawal. Tissues from the accumbens and ventral tegmental area  (VTA) were assayed for candidate molecular neuroadaptations, including enzyme activities of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and adenylate cyclase (AC), and protein expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and glutamate receptor subunits (GluR1, GluR2 and NMDAR1). In the accumbens of cocaine-trained rats, GluR1 and NMDAR1 levels were increased on days 1 and 90, while GluR2 levels were increased on days 1 and 30, but not day 90; PKA activity  levels were increased on days 1 and 30, but not day 90, while AC activity, TH and cdk5 levels were unaltered. In the VTA of cocaine-trained rats, NMDAR1 levels were increased for up to 90 days, while GluR2 levels were increased only on day 1; TH and Cdk5 levels were increased only on day 1, while PKA and AC activity levels were unaltered. Cocaine self-administration produces long-lasting molecular neuroadaptations in the VTA and accumbens that may underlie cocaine relapse during periods of abstinence.", "12473091": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a crucial role in addiction. We have recently shown that activation of presynaptic metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptors (mGlu2/3) induces long-term depression (LTD) at glutamatergic synapses in the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc) through the long lasting inhibition of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels and the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. Because presynaptic mGlu2/3 functions are augmented in the ventral tegmental area of morphine-withdrawn rats, we have evaluated the consequences of opiate treatment on mGlu2/3 LTD at prelimbic NAc glutamatergic synapses. Here we report that mGlu2/3 LTD is abolished after 1 week of withdrawal from chronic morphine treatment; in the morphine-withdrawn group LTD measured 5.99 +/- 4.84% (P < 0.05) compared with 21.13 +/- 5.42% in the sham group. In contrast, chronic morphine treatment did not alter the mechanisms normally underlying mGlu2/3 LTD, such as the cAMP/PKA pathway or P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. This study shows that one long-term consequence of morphine treatment is an alteration of synaptic plasticity at glutamatergic synapses in the NAc. Considering that mGlu2/3 agonists (e.g. LY-354740 used in the present study to induce LTD) reduce behavioural symptoms of morphine withdrawal, these findings could be important in the understanding of the cellular events underlying the dependence-inducing properties of opiates.", "11522463": "The purpose of the present experiment was to investigate the involvement of NMDA  and AMPA/KA receptors in the nucleus accumbens core and shell in the control over cocaine-seeking behavior by drug-associated cues. Rats were trained under a second-order schedule of reinforcement for cocaine with five infusions of cocaine being available in each daily session. The NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 and the  AMPA/KA receptor antagonist LY293558 were infused directly into the core or shell. LY293558 infused into the core produced a dose-dependent decrease in responding during both the first, cocaine-unaffected interval and also after cocaine had been self-administered in subsequent intervals. By contrast, AP-5 infused into the core had no effect on responding. Infusion of AP-5 into the shell had the limited effect of decreasing responding during the second interval  only. There were no effects of LY293558 infused into the shell. These results indicate that NMDA and AMPA receptor-mediated glutamate transmission in the core  and shell are dissociably involved in cocaine-seeking behavior controlled in part by drug-associated cues.", "10415662": "Only recently have the functional implications of the organization of the ventral striatum, amygdala, and related limbic-cortical structures, and their neuroanatomical interactions begun to be clarified. Processes of activation and reward have long been associated with the NAcc and its dopamine innervation, but  the precise relationships between these constructs have remained elusive. We have sought to enrich our understanding of the special role of the ventral striatum in coordinating the contribution of different functional subsystems to confer flexibility, as well as coherence and vigor, to goal-directed behavior, through different forms of associative learning. Such appetitive behavior comprises many  subcomponents, some of which we have isolated in these experiments to reveal that, not surprisingly, the mechanisms by which an animal sequences responding to reach a goal are complex. The data reveal how the different components, pavlovian approach (or sign-tracking), conditioned reinforcement (whereby pavlovian stimuli control goal-directed action), and also more general response-invigorating processes (often called \"activation,\" \"stress,\" or \"drive\") may be integrated within the ventral striatum through convergent interactions of the amygdala, other limbic cortical structures, and the mesolimbic dopamine system to produce coherent behavior. The position is probably not far different when considering aversively motivated behavior. Although it may be necessary to employ simplified, even abstract, paradigms for isolating these mechanisms, their concerted action can readily be appreciated in an adaptive, functional setting, such as the responding by rats for intravenous cocaine under a second-order schedule of reinforcement. Here, the interactions of primary reinforcement, psychomotor activation, pavlovian conditioning, and the control that drug cues exert over the integrated drug-seeking response can be seen to operate both serially and concurrently. The power of our analytic techniques for understanding complex motivated behavior has been evident for some time. However, the crucial point is  that we are now able to map these components with increasing certainty onto discrete amygdaloid, and other limbic cortical-ventral striatal subsystems. The neural dissection of these mechanisms also serves an important theoretical purpose in helping to validate the various hypothetical constructs and further developing theory. Major challenges remain, not the least of which is an understanding of the operation of the ventral striatum together with its dopaminergic innervation and its interactions with the basolateral amygdala, hippocampal formation, and prefrontal cortex at a more mechanistic, neuronal level.", "7636023": "The postsynaptic effects of dopamine in the striatum are mediated mainly by receptors encoded by D1, D2, and D3 dopamine receptor genes. The D1 and D2 genes  are the most widely expressed in the caudate-putamen, the accumbens nucleus, and  the olfactory tubercle. Several anatomical studies, including studies using in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide and cDNA probes, have suggested that D1 and D2 receptors are segregated into distinct efferent neuronal populations of the striatum: D1 in substance P striatonigral neurons and D2 in enkephalin striatopallidal neurons. In contrast, on the basis of several in vivo and in vitro studies, other authors have suggested the existence of an extensive colocalization of D1 and D2 in the same striatal neurons. Our study was undertaken in order to analyze in detail the expression of the D1 and D2 receptor genes in the efferent striatal populations, with special reference to the various striatal areas, and to yield insights into the question about D1 and D2 mRNA localization in the striatum. We have, therefore, used highly sensitive digoxigenin- and 35S-labeled cRNA probes to address this question. The present results demonstrate that the D1 and D2 receptor mRNAs are segregated, respectively, in substance P and enkephalin neurons in the caudate-putamen and accumbens nucleus (shell and core) and in the olfactory tubercle (for their largest part). A very small percentage of neurons may coexpress both genes. These results confirm that the D1 and D2 receptor genes are expressed in distinct populations of striatal efferent neurons in the normal adult rat.", "1346804": "Increased activity of dopamine-containing neurons in the ventral tegmental area is necessary for the reinforcing effects of opioids and other abused drugs. Intracellular recordings from these cells in slices of rat brain in vitro showed  that opioids do not affect the principal (dopamine-containing) neurons but hyperpolarize secondary (GABA-containing) interneurons. Experiments with agonists and antagonists selective for opioid receptor subtypes indicated that the hyperpolarization of secondary cells involved the mu-receptor. Most principal cells showed spontaneous bicuculline-sensitive synaptic potentials when the extracellular potassium concentration was increased from 2.5 to 6.5 or 10.5 mM; these were prevented by TTX and assumed to result from action potentials arising  in slightly depolarized local interneurons. The frequency of these synaptic potentials, but not their amplitudes, was reduced by opioids selective for mu-receptors. It is concluded that hyperpolarization of the interneurons by opioids reduces the spontaneous GABA-mediated synaptic input to the dopamine cells. In vivo, this would lead to excitation of the dopamine cells by disinhibition, which would be expected to contribute to the positive reinforcement seen with mu-receptor agonists such as morphine and heroin.", "26889809": "To understand brain function, it is essential that we discover how cellular signaling specifies normal and pathological brain function. In this regard, chemogenetic technologies represent valuable platforms for manipulating neuronal  and non-neuronal signal transduction in a cell-type-specific fashion in freely moving animals.

Here I provide a primer on DREADDs highlighting key technical  and conceptual considerations and identify challenges for chemogenetics going forward.", "26860202": "Social play behavior is a highly rewarding form of social interaction displayed by young mammals. Social play is important for neurobehavioral development and it has been found to be impaired in several developmental psychiatric disorders. In  line with the rewarding properties of social play, we have previously identified  the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as an important site of action for endocannabinoid and opioid modulation of this behavior. NAc dopamine has a well-known role in certain components of reward processes, such as incentive motivation. However, its contribution to the positive emotional aspects of social interactions is less clear. Therefore, we investigated the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the NAc in social play behavior in rats. We found that intra-NAc infusion of the  dopamine releaser/reuptake inhibitor amphetamine increased social play behavior that was dependent on activation of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. This increase in social play behavior was mimicked by intra-NAc infusion of the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine, but not of the dopamine reuptake inhibitor GBR-12909. Blockade of either D1 or D2 NAc dopamine receptors reduced social play in animals highly motivated to play as a result of longer social isolation before testing. Last, blockade of NAc dopamine receptors prevented the play-enhancing effects of endocannabinoid and opioid receptor stimulation. These findings demonstrate an important modulatory role of NAc dopaminergic neurotransmission in social play. Thus, functional activity in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway plays an important role in adaptive social development, whereas abnormal NAc dopamine function may underlie the social impairments observed in developmental psychiatric disorders such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or early-onset schizophrenia.", "21525276": "Positive social interactions are essential for emotional well-being and proper behavioral development of young individuals. Here, we studied the neural underpinnings of social reward by investigating the involvement of opioid neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in social play behavior, a highly rewarding social interaction in adolescent rats. Intra-NAc infusion of morphine (0.05-0.1 \u03bcg) increased pinning and pouncing, characteristic elements of social play behavior in rats, and blockade of NAc opioid receptors with naloxone  (0.5 \u03bcg) prevented the play-enhancing effects of systemic morphine (1 mg/kg, s.c.) administration. Thus, stimulation of opioid receptors in the NAc was necessary and sufficient for morphine to increase social play. Intra-NAc treatment with the selective \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),Gly(5)-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) (0.1-10 ng) and the \u03bc-opioid receptor antagonist Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH(2) (CTAP) (0.3-3 \u03bcg) increased and decreased social play, respectively. The \u03b4-opioid receptor agonist  DPDPE ([D-Pen(2),D-Pen(5)]-enkephalin) (0.3-3 \u03bcg) had no effects, whereas the \u03ba-opioid receptor agonist U69593 (N-methyl-2-phenyl-N-[(5R,7S,8S)-7-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-oxaspiro[4.5]dec-8-yl]acet amide) (0.01-1 \u03bcg) decreased social play. Intra-NAc treatment with \u03b2-endorphin (0.01-1 \u03bcg) increased social play, but met-enkephalin (0.1-5 \u03bcg) and the enkephalinase inhibitor thiorphan (0.1-1 \u03bcg) were ineffective. DAMGO (0.1-10 ng)  increased social play after infusion into both the shell and core subregions of the NAc. Last, intra-NAc infusion of CTAP (3 \u03bcg) prevented the development of social play-induced conditioned place preference. These findings identify NAc \u03bc-opioid receptor stimulation as an important neural mechanism for the attribution of positive value to social interactions in adolescent rats.

A key result of stress is structural remodeling of neural architecture, which may be a sign of successful adaptation, whereas persistence of these changes when stress ends indicates failed resilience. Excitatory amino acids and glucocorticoids have key  roles in these processes, along with a growing list of extra- and intracellular mediators that includes endocannabinoids and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The result is a continually changing pattern of gene expression mediated  by epigenetic mechanisms involving histone modifications and CpG methylation and  hydroxymethylation as well as by the activity of retrotransposons that may alter  genomic stability.

However, limited experimental support for strong lateral inhibition mechanisms within striatal regions questions this model. Here, stimulation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using naturally occurring bursty patterns inhibited firing in most nucleus accumbens (NA) projection neurons. When an excitatory response was observed for one stimulation site, neighboring PFC sites evoked inhibition in the same neuron. Furthermore, PFC stimulation activated interneurons, and PFC-evoked inhibition was blocked by GABA(A) antagonists in corticoaccumbens slice preparations. Thus bursting PFC activity recruits local inhibition in the NA, shaping responses of projection neurons with a topographical arrangement that allows inhibition among parallel corticoaccumbens  channels. The data indicate a high order of information processing within striatal circuits that should be considered in models of basal ganglia function and disease.", "12209848": "A combination of anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques was used to study  the projections to the nucleus accumbens from the amygdala, the hippocampal formation (including the entorhinal cortex), and the perirhinal cortex in two species of macaque monkey. To help identify possible subregions within the nucleus accumbens, the distribution of calbindin was examined in two additional monkeys. Although this revealed evidence of \"core\"- and \"shell\"-like regions within the accumbens, these different regions could not consistently be related to cytoarchitectonic features. The rostral amygdala sent nearly equivalent projections to both the medial and the lateral portions of nucleus accumbens, whereas projections arising from the middle and caudal amygdala terminated preferentially in the medial division of nucleus accumbens. The basal nucleus was the major source of these amygdala efferents, and there was a crude topography as parts of the basal and accessory basal nuclei terminated in different parts of nucleus accumbens. The subiculum was the major source of hippocampal projections  to the nucleus accumbens, but some hippocampal efferents also originated in the parasubiculum, the prosubiculum, the adjacent portion of CA1, and the uncal portion of CA3. These hippocampal projections, which coursed through the fornix,  showed a rostrocaudal gradient as more arose in the rostral hippocampus. Hippocampal efferents terminated most densely in the medial and ventral portions  of nucleus accumbens, along with light label in the adjacent olfactory tubercle.  The entorhinal projections were more evenly distributed between the medial nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle, whereas the perirhinal projections  were primarily to the olfactory tubercle. These cortical inputs were less reliant on the fornix. Amygdala and subicular (hippocampal) projections overlapped most completely in the medial division of nucleus accumbens.", "21411660": "Neuroadaptation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a central component of the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, has been implicated in the development of cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization and relapse to cocaine seeking. However, little is known about the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying such adaptation. Using a mouse model of behavioral sensitization, we show that animals withdrawn from repeated cocaine exposure have a selective deficit in the  ability to elicit metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent long-term depression (LTD) in the shell of the NAc in response to bath application of the group I mGluR agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). Experiments conducted in the presence of the selective mGluR1 antagonists 7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropachromen-carboxylate ethyl ester and (S)-(+)-\u03b1-amino-4-carboxy-2-methylbenzeneacetic acid, or the mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine, demonstrated that the impaired DHPG-LTD is likely attributable to a loss of mGluR5 function. Quantitative real-time reverse  transcriptase-PCR and Western blot analysis revealed significant downregulation of mGluR5, but not mGluR1, mRNA and protein levels in the NAc shell. The inhibitory effect of repeated cocaine exposure on DHPG-LTD was selectively prevented when cocaine was coadministered with the selective D(1)-like DA receptor antagonist (R)-(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine. Furthermore, the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein in the NAc shell increased progressively after cocaine withdrawal, and the impairment of DHPG-LTD in the NAc shell was not found in slices from BDNF-knock-out mice after cocaine withdrawal. These results suggest that withdrawal from repeated cocaine exposure may result in increased BDNF levels in  the NAc shell, which leads to a selective downregulation of mGluR5 and thereby impairs the induction of mGluR-dependent LTD.", "12832502": "The rewarding properties of the psychoactive constituents of marijuana, termed \"cannabinoids,\" may reflect actions on synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Furthermore, long-term changes in these synapses may support the addictive process. Excitatory and inhibitory synapses are acutely inhibited by cannabinoids in the NAc, and endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) play a critical role in the expression of long-term depression (LTD) of excitatory cortical afferents in this structure. Because humans often use marijuana for prolonged periods, we examined the impact of long-term cannabinoid exposure on synaptic processes in an animal model. Electrophysiological recordings in rat brain slices containing the NAc were performed after chronic exposure to vehicle  solution, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), or the cannabinoid agonist R(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazi n-6-yl]-(1-naphthalenyl)methanone mesylate (WIN55,212-2). Extracellular glutamatergic postsynaptic potentials and whole-cell GABAergic IPSCs were concentration-dependently inhibited by WIN55,212-2 in slices from naive or vehicle-treated animals. However, the sensitivity to WIN55,212-2 was diminished in chronic agonist-treated animals. In addition, cross-tolerance to the inhibitory effect of the mu-opioid agonist Tyr-D-Ala2, N-CH3-Phe4,Gly-ol-enkephalin was observed. Endocannabinoid-mediated LTD was initiated via electrical stimulation (5 min, 10 Hz) of glutamatergic afferents to the NAc and was completely blocked by the cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR141716A [N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methylpyrazole-3-carbox amide] in vehicle-treated animals. LTD was not observed in brain slices from rats chronically treated with Delta9-THC or WIN55,212-2. These data demonstrate that long-term exposure to the active ingredient of marijuana blocks synaptic plasticity in the NAc and reduces the sensitivity of GABAergic and glutamatergic  synapses to both cannabinoids and opioids.", "11976704": "The striatum functions critically in movement control and habit formation. The development and function of cortical input to the striatum are thought to be regulated by activity-dependent plasticity of corticostriatal glutamatergic synapses. Here we show that the induction of a form of striatal synaptic plasticity, long-term depression (LTD), is dependent on activation of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor. LTD was facilitated by blocking cellular endocannabinoid uptake, and postsynaptic loading of anandamide (AEA) produced presynaptic depression. The endocannabinoid necessary for striatal LTD is thus likely to be released postsynaptically as a retrograde messenger. These findings demonstrate a new role for endocannabinoids in the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity in a circuit necessary for habit formation and motor control.", "10908594": "Long-lasting adaptations in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system in response to drugs of abuse likely mediate many of the behavioral changes that underlie addiction. Recent work suggests that long-term changes in synaptic strength at excitatory synapses in the two major components of this system, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral tegmental area, may be particularly important for the development of drug-induced sensitization, a process that may contribute to addiction, as well as for normal response-reinforcement learning. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques from in vitro slice preparations, we  have examined the existence and basic mechanisms of long-term depression (LTD) at excitatory synapses on both GABAergic medium spiny neurons in the NAc and dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. We find that both sets of synapses express  LTD but that their basic triggering mechanisms differ. Furthermore, DA blocks the induction of LTD in the midbrain via activation of D2-like receptors but has minimal effects on LTD in the NAc. The existence of LTD in mesolimbic structures  and its modulation by DA represent mechanisms that may contribute to the modifications of neural circuitry that mediate reward-related learning as well as the development of addiction.", "23416703": "Depression induces structural and functional synaptic plasticity in brain reward  circuits, although the mechanisms promoting these changes and their relevance to  behavioral outcomes are unknown. Transcriptional profiling of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) for Rho GTPase-related genes, which are known regulators of synaptic structure, revealed a sustained reduction in RAS-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) expression after chronic social defeat stress. This was  associated with a repressive chromatin state surrounding the proximal promoter of Rac1. Inhibition of class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) with MS-275 rescued both the decrease in Rac1 transcription after social defeat stress and depression-related behavior, such as social avoidance. We found a similar repressive chromatin state surrounding the RAC1 promoter in the NAc of subjects with depression, which corresponded with reduced RAC1 transcription. Viral-mediated reduction of Rac1 expression or inhibition of Rac1 activity in the NAc increases social defeat-induced social avoidance and anhedonia in mice. Chronic social defeat stress induces the formation of stubby excitatory spines through a Rac1-dependent mechanism involving the redistribution of synaptic cofilin, an actin-severing protein downstream of Rac1. Overexpression of constitutively active Rac1 in the NAc of mice after chronic social defeat stress  reverses depression-related behaviors and prunes stubby spines. Taken together, our data identify epigenetic regulation of RAC1 in the NAc as a disease mechanism in depression and reveal a functional role for Rac1 in rodents in regulating stress-related behaviors.", "19200535": "BACKGROUND: Systemic exposure to amphetamine (AMPH) leads to a number of long-lasting neuroadaptations including changes in dendritic morphology in rat forebrain. It remains unknown whether these changes relate to associative drug conditioning or to nonassociative drug sensitization, two forms of plasticity produced by systemic exposure to AMPH. METHODS: We compared the behavioral, neuronal, and morphologic consequences of exposing rats to intraperitoneal (IP) AMPH to those of exposure to AMPH applied to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), infusions that sensitize AMPH-induced locomotion and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) DA overflow but do not produce drug conditioning. RESULTS: Both IP and VTA AMPH exposure sensitized locomotion and NAcc DA overflow, but only IP AMPH exposure produced conditioned locomotion. Importantly, whereas IP AMPH exposure increased spine density and dendritic length and branching in the NAcc, exposure to VTA AMPH produced the opposite effects. A similar differentiation of effects was observed in cortical areas. CONCLUSIONS: Together these findings suggest that the morphological changes seen  following IP AMPH exposure reflect associative drug conditioning rather than nonassociative drug sensitization. The decreases observed in the NAcc of VTA AMPH exposed rats may reflect the inability of these infusions to support conditioning.", "24130517": "Dopamine (DA) regulates emotional and motivational behavior through the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway. Changes in DA mesolimbic neurotransmission have  been found to modify behavioral responses to various environmental stimuli associated with reward behaviors. Psychostimulants, drugs of abuse, and natural reward such as food can cause substantial synaptic modifications to the mesolimbic DA system. Recent studies using optogenetics and DREADDs, together with neuron-specific or circuit-specific genetic manipulations have improved our  understanding of DA signaling in the reward circuit, and provided a means to identify the neural substrates of complex behaviors such as drug addiction and eating disorders. This review focuses on the role of the DA system in drug addiction and food motivation, with an overview of the role of D1 and D2 receptors in the control of reward-associated behaviors.", "23175840": "Mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) has been implicated in cost/benefit decision making about risks and rewards. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) are two DA terminal regions that contribute to decision making in distinct  manners. However, how fluctuations of tonic DA levels may relate to different aspects of decision making remains to be determined. The present study measured DA efflux in the PFC and NAc with microdialysis in well trained rats performing a probabilistic discounting task. Selection of a small/certain option always delivered one pellet, whereas another, large/risky option yielded four pellets, with probabilities that decreased (100-12.5%) or increased (12.5-100%) across four blocks of trials. Yoked-reward groups were also included to control for reward delivery. PFC DA efflux during decision making decreased or increased over a session, corresponding to changes in large/risky reward probabilities. Similar  profiles were observed from yoked-rewarded rats, suggesting that fluctuations in  PFC DA reflect changes in the relative rate of reward received. NAc DA efflux also showed decreasing/increasing trends over the session during both tasks. However, DA efflux was higher during decision making on free- versus forced-choice trials and during periods of greater reward uncertainty. Moreover,  changes in NAc DA closely tracked shifts in choice biases. These data reveal dynamic and dissociable fluctuations in PFC and NAc DA transmission associated with different aspects of risk-based decision making. PFC DA may signal changes in reward availability that facilitates modification of choice biases, whereas NAc DA encodes integrated signals about reward rates, uncertainty, and choice, reflecting implementation of decision policies.", "19262467": "Different forms of behavioral flexibility are facilitated by interactions between separate regions of the prefrontal cortex and their striatal outputs. However, the contribution of ventral striatal dopamine (DA) to these functions is unclear. The present study assessed the involvement of DA receptors in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core on either between- or within-strategy shifts using operant chamber-based tasks. Strategy set-shifting required rats initially to learn a visual-cue discrimination and, on the following day, shift to using an egocentric spatial response strategy to obtain reward. For reversal learning, rats were initially trained on a response discrimination and then required to select the opposite lever to receive food reward. Intra-NAc microinfusions of D(1) (SCH23390) but not D(2) (eticlopride) receptor antagonists impaired set-shifting, disrupting the maintenance of a new strategy. Conversely, supranormal activation  of D(2) (quinpirole) but not D(1) (SKF81297) receptors also impaired set-shifting, inducing perseverative deficits. However, only infusions of the D(2) agonist impaired reversal learning, but did so without disrupting initial response learning. Thus, mesoaccumbens DA, acting on D(1) receptors, selectively  facilitates complex forms of flexibility requiring shifts between different strategies, but does not appear to contribute to simpler forms of flexibility entailing shifts of specific stimulus-reward associations. In contrast, abnormal  increases in D(2) receptor activity cause a more general impairment in behavioral flexibility. These findings suggest that deficits in these forms of executive functioning observed in disorders linked to dysfunction of the DA system may be attributable in part to aberrant increases or decreases in mesoaccumbens DA activity.", "18668030": "Psychopharmacological studies have implicated the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system in the mediation of cost/benefit evaluations about delay or effort-related costs  associated with larger rewards. However, the role of DA in risk-based decision making remains relatively unexplored. The present study investigated the effects  of systemic manipulations of DA transmission on risky choice using a probabilistic discounting task. Over discrete trials, rats chose between two levers; a press on the 'small/certain' lever always delivered one reward pellet,  whereas a press on the other, 'large/risky' lever delivered four pellets, but the probability of receiving reward decreased across the four trial blocks (100, 50,  25, 12.5%). In separate groups of well-trained rats we assessed the effects of the DA releaser amphetamine, as well as receptor selective agonists and antagonists. Amphetamine consistently increased preference for the large/risky lever; an effect that was blocked or attenuated by co-administration of either D(1) (SCH23390) or D(2) (eticlopride) receptor antagonists. Blockade of either of these receptors alone induced risk aversion. Conversely, stimulation of D(1) (SKF81297) or D(2) (bromocriptine) receptors also increased risky choice. In contrast, activation of D(3) receptors with PD128,907 reduced choice of the large/risky lever. Likewise, D(3) antagonism with nafadotride potentiated the amphetamine-induced increase in risky choice. Blockade or stimulation of D(4) receptors did not reliably alter behavior. These findings indicate that DA has a  critical role in mediating risk-based decision making, with increased activation  of D(1) and D(2) receptors biasing choice toward larger, probabilistic rewards, whereas D(3) receptors appear to exert opposing effects on this form of decision  making.", "12708516": "The current studies were designed to evaluate whether incentive motivation for palatable food is altered after manipulations of opioid, GABAergic, and dopaminergic transmission within the nucleus accumbens. A progressive ratio schedule was used to measure lever-pressing for sugar pellets after microinfusion of drugs into the nucleus accumbens in non-food-deprived rats. The mu opioid agonist D-Ala2, NMe-Phe4, Glyo15-enkephalin and the indirect dopamine agonist amphetamine induced a marked increase in break point and correct lever-presses; the GABA(A) agonist muscimol did not affect breakpoint or lever-presses. The data suggest that opioid, dopaminergic, and GABAergic systems within the accumbens differentially modulate food-seeking behavior through mechanisms related to hedonic evaluation of food, incentive salience, and control of motor feeding circuits, respectively.", "11509194": "Although interference with dopamine (DA) systems can suppress lever pressing for  food reinforcement, it is not clear whether this effect occurs because of a general disruption of food motivation. One way of assessing this has been a choice procedure in which a rat responds on an fixed ratio 5 (FR5) schedule for preferred Bioserve pellets while a less preferred lab chow is concurrently available in the operant chamber. Untreated rats consume little of the chow, preferring to respond for the Bioserve pellets. Previous studies have shown that  depleting DA in the accumbens substantially decreased lever pressing while increasing chow consumption. In the present study, low doses (0.0625-1.0 microg)  of the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 or the D2 antagonist raclopride were injected into the either the core or shell subregions of nucleus accumbens, and rats were tested on the concurrent lever pressing/feeding task. Analysis of the dose response curves showed that injections of SCH 23390 into the core were more potent than injections into the shell for suppressing lever pressing (i.e., the ED(50) was lower in the core). Nevertheless, injections of either drug into either site suppressed lever pressing and increased intake of the concurrently available chow. Across both drugs and at both sites, the amount of chow consumed  was negatively correlated with the total number of responses. Neither drug significantly increased response duration, suggesting that accumbens DA antagonism did not produce the type of motor impairment that leads to severe alterations in the form of lever pressing. In summary, the blockade of D1 or D2 receptors in nucleus accumbens core or shell decreased lever pressing for food reinforcers, but rats remained directed toward the acquisition and consumption of food. These results indicate that accumbens D1 antagonism does not decrease lever pressing because of a general reduction in food motivation. Nevertheless, interference with accumbens DA does appear to set constraints upon which responses are selected for obtaining food, and may impair the ability of animals  to overcome work-related response costs in order to obtain food.", "9512057": "Three experiments investigated the behavioral effects of injections of the neurotoxic agent 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the core or shell of the nucleus accumbens. In the first experiment, it was observed that injections of 6-OHDA into either core or shell had no significant effect on variable interval 30-s responding. In Experiment 2, responding on a fixed ratio 5 (FR5) schedule was impaired by 6-OHDA injections in the core, but not the shell. Rats with core injections of 6-OHDA showed significant alterations in the relative distribution  of interresponse times, which were indicative of reductions in the maximal rate of responding and increases in the number of pauses. In the third experiment, rats were tested using a lever-pressing/chow-feeding procedure, in which a preferred food (Bioserve pellets) was available by pressing a lever on a FR5 schedule, but a less preferred food (lab chow) was also available concurrently in the test chamber. Untreated rats usually pressed the lever at high rates to obtain the food pellets and ate little of the lab chow. After training, dopamine  depletions were produced by injections of 6-OHDA directly into the core or dorsomedial shell subregions. Injections of 6-OHDA into the core significantly decreased lever pressing for food pellets, increased lab chow consumption, and decreased the relative amount of food obtained by lever pressing. Dorsomedial shell injections of 6-OHDA had no significant effects on either lever pressing or lab chow consumption. Neurochemical results indicate that injections of 6-OHDA in the shell produced substantial depletions in the shell that were somewhat selective; however, injections of 6-OHDA into the core tended to deplete both core and shell. Correlational analyses revealed that decreases in FR5 lever pressing were associated with dopamine levels in the core, but not the shell. The present results indicate that substantial depletions of dopamine in the dorsomedial shell are not sufficient for suppressing reinforced lever pressing, and indicate that dopamine depletions must include the core area to impair performance on these tasks. The lack of effect of accumbens dopamine depletions on VI30 responding are consistent with the notion that accumbens dopamine depletions affect responding on schedules that generate a high rate of responding (FR5), but not those that generate a moderate rate of responding (e.g., VI30 s).  The results of the concurrent FR5/chow-feeding experiment indicate that rats with accumbens dopamine depletions remain directed towards the acquisition and consumption of food. These results suggest that dopamine in the core region of accumbens sets constraints upon the selection of food-related behaviors, and that core dopamine depletions alter the relative allocation of food-related responses.", "25787124": "Alcohol use disorder is a chronic relapsing brain disease characterized by the loss of ability to control alcohol (ethanol) intake despite knowledge of detrimental health or personal consequences. Clinical and pre-clinical models provide strong evidence for chronic ethanol-associated alterations in glutamatergic signaling and impaired synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the neural mechanisms that contribute to aberrant glutamatergic signaling in ethanol-dependent individuals in this critical brain structure remain unknown. Using an unbiased proteomic approach, we investigated the effects of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure on neuroadaptations in postsynaptic density (PSD)-enriched proteins in the NAc of ethanol-dependent mice. Compared with controls, CIE exposure significantly changed expression levels of 50 proteins in the PSD-enriched fraction. Systems biology and functional annotation analyses demonstrated that the dysregulated proteins are expressed at tetrapartite synapses and critically regulate cellular morphology. To confirm this latter finding, the density and morphology of dendritic spines were examined in the NAc core of ethanol-dependent mice. We found that CIE exposure and withdrawal differentially altered dendrite diameter and dendritic spine density and morphology. Through the use of quantitative proteomics and functional annotation, these series of experiments demonstrate that ethanol dependence produces neuroadaptations in proteins that modify dendritic spine morphology. In addition, these studies identified novel PSD-related proteins that contribute to the neurobiological mechanisms of ethanol dependence that drive maladaptive structural plasticity of NAc neurons.", "17706608": "The past two decades have witnessed a dramatic accumulation of evidence indicating that the excitatory amino acid glutamate plays an important role in drug addiction and alcoholism. The purpose of this review is to summarize findings on glutamatergic substrates of addiction, surveying data from both human and animal studies. The effects of various drugs of abuse on glutamatergic neurotransmission are discussed, as are the effects of pharmacological or genetic manipulation of various components of glutamate transmission on drug reinforcement, conditioned reward, extinction, and relapse-like behavior. In addition, glutamatergic agents that are currently in use or are undergoing testing in clinical trials for the treatment of addiction are discussed, including acamprosate, N-acetylcysteine, modafinil, topiramate, lamotrigine, gabapentin and memantine. All drugs of abuse appear to modulate glutamatergic transmission, albeit by different mechanisms, and this modulation of glutamate transmission is believed to result in long-lasting neuroplastic changes in the brain that may contribute to the perseveration of drug-seeking behavior and drug-associated memories. In general, attenuation of glutamatergic transmission reduces drug reward, reinforcement, and relapse-like behavior. On the other hand, potentiation of glutamatergic transmission appears to facilitate the extinction of drug-seeking behavior. However, attempts at identifying genetic polymorphisms  in components of glutamate transmission in humans have yielded only a limited number of candidate genes that may serve as risk factors for the development of addiction. Nonetheless, manipulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission appears to be a promising avenue of research in developing improved therapeutic agents for the treatment of drug addiction and alcoholism.", "17198693": "Alcohol is known to affect glutamate transmission. However, how chronic alcohol affects the synaptic structure mediating glutamate transmission is unknown. Repeated alcohol exposure in a subject with familial alcoholic history often leads to alcohol addiction. The current study adopts alcohol-preferring rats, which are known to develop high drinking. Two-photon microscopy analysis indicates that chronic alcohol of 14 weeks either, under continuous alcohol (C-Alc) or with repeated deprivation (RD-Alc), causes dysmorphology--thickened, beaded, and disoriented dendrites that are reminiscent of reactive astrocytes--in a subpopulation of medium spiny neurons. The density of dendritic spines was found differentially lower in the nucleus accumbens of RD-Alc and C-Alc groups as compared with those of Water groups. Large-sized spines and multiple-headed spines were increased in the RD-Alc group. The NMDA receptor subunit NR1 proteins, as analyzed with Western blot, were upregulated in C-Alc, but not in RD-Alc. The upregulated NMDA receptor subunits of NR1 however, are predominantly  a splice variant isoform with truncated exon 21, which is required for membrane-bound trafficking or anchoring into a spine synaptic site. These maladaptations may contribute to the transformation of spines. The changes, in density and head-size of spines and the corresponding NMDA receptors, demonstrated an alteration of microcircuitry for glutamate reception. The current study demonstrates for the first time that chronic alcohol exposure causes structural alteration of dendrites and their spines in the key reward brain region in animals that have a genetic background leading to alcohol addiction.", "12700699": "Repeated intermittent treatment with amphetamine increases the density of dendritic spines on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc).  The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to determine whether amphetamine has  similar effects on MSNs in the caudate-putamen (CPu) and (2) to determine if this effect is localized to distal dendrites, the site of convergence of dopamine (DA) and glutamate synapses in the striatum. An amphetamine treatment regimen that produced behavioral sensitization increased the density of dendritic spines on MSNs in both the NAcc and dorsolateral CPu. This effect was long lasting, because it was evident 3.5 months after the discontinuation of drug treatment. The increase in spine density was confined to distal dendrites of MSNs, and was not apparent on dendrites close to the cell body. It is concluded that amphetamine may preferentially reorganize synapses at the site of DA-glutamate interaction in the striatum, which may alter DA-glutamate signaling and thereby contribute to some of the persistent behavioral and psychological consequences of repeated exposure to psychostimulant drugs.", "9334421": "Experience-dependent changes in behavior are thought to involve structural modifications in the nervous system, especially alterations in patterns of synaptic connectivity. Repeated experience with drugs of abuse can result in very long-lasting changes in behavior, including a persistent hypersensitivity (sensitization) to their psychomotor activating and rewarding effects. It was hypothesized, therefore, that repeated treatment with the psychomotor stimulant drug amphetamine, which produces robust sensitization, would produce structural adaptations in brain regions that mediate its psychomotor activating and rewarding effects. Consistent with this hypothesis, it was found that amphetamine treatment altered the morphology of neurons in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. Exposure to amphetamine produced a long-lasting (>1 month) increase in the length of dendrites, in the density of dendritic spines, and in the number of branched spines on the major output cells of the nucleus accumbens, the medium spiny neurons, as indicated by analysis of Golgi-stained material. Amphetamine treatment produced similar effects on the apical (but not basilar) dendrites of layer III pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex. The ability of amphetamine to alter patterns of synaptic connectivity in these structures may contribute to some of the long-term behavioral consequences of repeated amphetamine use, including amphetamine psychosis and addiction.", "25541492": "BACKGROUND: To make appropriate choices, organisms must weigh the costs and benefits of potential valuable outcomes, a process known to involve the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and its dopaminergic input. However, it is currently unknown if dopamine dynamically tracks alterations in expected reward value online as behavioral preferences change and if so, if it is causally linked to specific components of value such as reward magnitude and/or delay to reinforcement. METHODS: Electrochemical methods were used to measure subsecond NAc dopamine release during a delay discounting task where magnitude was fixed but delay varied across blocks (n = 7 rats). Next, to assess whether this dopamine signaling was causally related to specific components of choice behavior, we employed selective optogenetic stimulation of dopamine terminals in the NAc using a modified delay discounting task in which both delay and magnitude varied independently (n = 23 rats). RESULTS: Cues predictive of available choices evoked dopamine release that scaled with the rat's preferred choices and dynamically shifted as delay to reinforcement for the large reward increased. In the second experiment, dopamine  signaling was causally related to features of decision making, as optogenetically enhanced dopamine release within the NAc during predictive cue presentation was sufficient to alter subsequent value-related choices. Importantly, this dopamine-mediated shift in choice was limited to delay-based, but not magnitude-based, decisions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that NAc dopamine dynamically tracks delay discounting and establishes a causal role for this signaling in a subset of value-based associative strategies.", "22177980": "Anhedonia, or markedly diminished interest or pleasure, is a hallmark symptom of  major depression, schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Over the past three decades, the clinical definition of anhedonia has remained relatively  unchanged, although cognitive psychology and behavioral neuroscience have expanded our understanding of other reward-related processes. Here, we review the neural bases of the construct of anhedonia that reflects deficits in hedonic capacity and also closely linked to the constructs of reward valuation, decision-making, anticipation and motivation. The neural circuits subserving these reward-related processes include the ventral striatum, prefrontal cortical  regions, and afferent and efferent projections. An understanding of anhedonia and other reward-related constructs will facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of disorders that include reward deficits as key symptoms.", "21338879": "Impulsivity is the tendency to act prematurely without foresight. Behavioral and  neurobiological analysis of this construct, with evidence from both animal and human studies, defines several dissociable forms depending on distinct cortico-striatal substrates. One form of impulsivity depends on the temporal discounting of reward, another on motor or response disinhibition. Impulsivity is commonly associated with addiction to drugs from different pharmacological classes, but its causal role in human addiction is unclear. We characterize in neurobehavioral and neurochemical terms a rodent model of impulsivity based on premature responding in an attentional task. Evidence is surveyed that high impulsivity on this task precedes the escalation subsequently of cocaine self-administration behavior, and also a tendency toward compulsive cocaine-seeking and to relapse. These results indicate that the vulnerability to  stimulant addiction may depend on an impulsivity endophenotype. Implications of these findings for the etiology, development, and treatment of drug addiction are considered.", "20971936": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a role in hedonic reactivity to taste stimuli.  Learning can alter the hedonic valence of a given stimulus, and it remains unclear how the NAc encodes this shift. The present study examined whether the population response of NAc neurons to a taste stimulus is plastic using a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm. Electrophysiological and electromyographic (EMG) responses to intraoral infusions of a sucrose (0.3 M) solution were made in na\u00efve rats (Day 1). Immediately following the session, half of the rats (n = 6; Paired) received an injection of lithium chloride (0.15 M; i.p.) to induce malaise and establish a CTA while the other half (n = 6; Unpaired) received a saline injection. Days later (Day 5), NAc recordings during  infusions of sucrose were again made. Electrophysiological and EMG responses to sucrose did not differ between groups on Day 1. For both groups, the majority of  sucrose responsive neurons exhibited a decrease in firing rate (77% and 71% for Paired and Unpaired, respectively). Following conditioning, in Paired rats, EMG responses were indicative of aversion. Moreover, the majority of responsive NAc neurons now exhibited an increase in firing rate (69%). Responses in Unpaired rats were unchanged by the experience. Thus, the NAc differentially encodes the hedonic value of the same stimulus based on learned associations.", "630409": "One or two bottle preference tests, i.e., relative fluid consumption, constitute  the primary methodology for determining acceptance or rejection of tastes in animals other than humans. These tests require organisms to initiate and maintain drinking behavior, and, therefore, can not be applied to preparations which do not eat or drink spontaneously. The taste reactivity test, a new method for assessing responses to gustatory stimuli, circumvents this shortcoming. A 50 microliter taste stimulus is injected directly into the oral cavity of a freely moving rat and the immediate response videotaped for frame by frame analysis. Each of the sapid stimuli used (4 concentrations of sucrose, NaCl, HCl, and quinine HCl) generated a stereotyped response derived from a lexicon of 4 mimetic (movements of lingual, masticatory, and facial musculature) and 5 body response components. Responses to taste stimuli were highly consistent within and between  rats. For example, sapid sucrose, NaCl and HCl stimuli elicited a response sequence beginning with low amplitude, rhythmic mouth movements, followed by rhythmic tongue protrusions, and then lateral tongue movements. No body movements accompanied these mimetic responses. In contrast, quinine in concentrations at and above 3 X 10(-5) M (1/2 log step above the absolute behavioral threshold for  quinine) elicited a response pattern beginning with gaping and proceeding through as many as 5 body responses. These normative data for the intact rat can be directly compared to the taste reactivity of neurally ablated preparations which  do not spontaneously feed or drink. Such comparisons can be utlized in determining the neural substrates necessary for the execution and regulation of ingestive behavior.", "23311632": "We investigated the changes in dopamine (DA), glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) during cocaine self-administration in rats implanted with guide cannulae into the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum. After stabilized cocaine self-administration, separate groups of rats underwent extinction (10 days) procedure in which cocaine infusion was replaced by saline injections. With using a 'yoked' procedure, the effects of cocaine or its withdrawal on the level of neurotransmitters were evaluated by dual-probe microdialysis. Repeated cocaine administration reduced basal glutamate levels in the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, whereas it did not affect basal accumbal DA levels. Only rats that self-administered cocaine had increased basal GABA overflow in both examined brain structures. Active or passive cocaine administration elevated extracellular accumbal DA, however, the extent of cocaine-evoked DA level was significantly higher in rats that self-administered cocaine while both groups of animals showed also an attenuation of GABA level in the nucleus accumbens. On day 10 of extinction training, rats previously given cocaine revealed decreases in the basal accumbal concentration of glutamate while the basal GABA levels were significantly enhanced as compared with baseline of saline-yoked controls. Potassium depolarization delayed the reduction of the accumbal and pallidal extracellular glutamate levels in the active and passive cocaine groups. The present data indicate that changes in DA and GABA neurotransmission during maintenance phase mirror the motivational aspects of cocaine intake. Depending on acute (24 hours) or late (10 days) cocaine withdrawal, different neurotransmitter systems (i.e. glutamate or GABA) seem to be involved.", "22011681": "The loss of control over drug intake that occurs in addiction was initially believed to result from disruption of subcortical reward circuits. However, imaging studies in addictive behaviours have identified a key involvement of the  prefrontal cortex (PFC) both through its regulation of limbic reward regions and  its involvement in higher-order executive function (for example, self-control, salience attribution and awareness). This Review focuses on functional neuroimaging studies conducted in the past decade that have expanded our understanding of the involvement of the PFC in drug addiction. Disruption of the  PFC in addiction underlies not only compulsive drug taking but also accounts for  the disadvantageous behaviours that are associated with addiction and the erosion of free will.", "19732758": "The effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on cocaine-seeking are brain region-specific. Infusion of BDNF into subcortical structures, like the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area, enhances cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization and cocaine-seeking. Conversely, repeated administration of BDNF antiserum into the nucleus accumbens during chronic cocaine self-administration attenuates cocaine-induced reinstatement. In contrast, BDNF infusion into the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex immediately following a final session of cocaine self-administration attenuates relapse to cocaine-seeking after abstinence, as well as cue- and cocaine prime-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking following extinction. BDNF-induced alterations in the ERK-MAP kinase cascade and in prefronto-accumbens glutamatergic transmission are implicated in BDNF's ability to alter cocaine-seeking. Within 22 hours after infusion into the prefrontal cortex, BDNF increases BDNF protein in prefrontal cortical targets, including nucleus accumbens, and restores cocaine-mediated decreases in phospho-ERK expression in the nucleus accumbens. Furthermore, 3 weeks after BDNF infusion in  animals with a cocaine self-administration history, suppressed basal levels of glutamate are normalized and a cocaine prime-induced increase in extracellular glutamate levels in the nucleus accumbens is prevented. Thus, BDNF may have local effects at the site of infusion and distal effects in target areas that are critical to mediating or preventing cocaine-induced dysfunctional neuroadaptations.", "17940751": "RATIONALE: Accumbal excitatory amino acid (EAA) transmission has been implicated  in cocaine addiction. However, the time course effects of extinction of cocaine self-administration on EAAs are unknown. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to define the time course of cocaine  self-administration and extinction effects on glutamate and aspartate levels in the nucleus accumbens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine for 20 days,  and the levels of extracellular glutamate and aspartate were measured by in vivo  microdialysis both during cocaine self-administration and after a priming cocaine injection at different time points after extinction (1, 5, or 10 days). A food-reinforced control group was also included in this study. Furthermore, the effect of acute i.v. cocaine administration (0, 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg) on glutamate and aspartate levels was also evaluated. RESULTS: At any of the dose tested, acute i.v. cocaine did not affect the levels  of glutamate or aspartate in the Nacc. In contrast, glutamate levels were reduced in animals trained to self-administer cocaine, although they augmented substantially during a subsequent session of cocaine self-administration, and similar changes were not observed in food-reinforced controls. After 1 or 5, but  not after 10 days of extinction, the glutamate levels were also reduced, and the  ability of i.v. cocaine priming injections to increase glutamate levels followed  a similar time course. These effects were specific, as aspartate levels were not  affected by any administration protocol. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that glutamatergic transmission could be involved in the maintenance of cocaine self-administration and in the early phases of abstinence.", "16554471": "Cocaine primarily exerts its behavioral effects by enhancing dopaminergic neurotransmission, amplifying dopamine-encoded sensorimotor integration. The presumed mechanism for this effect is inhibition of the dopamine transporter, which blocks dopamine uptake and prolongs the duration of dopamine in the extracellular space. However, there is growing evidence that cocaine can also augment dopamine release. Here, we directly monitored the actions of cocaine on dopamine release by using electrochemical detection to measure extracellular dopamine in the striatum of anesthetized mice. Cocaine enhanced the levels of striatal dopamine produced by electrical stimulation of dopaminergic neurons. Even after pretreatment with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, which depletes the readily  releasable pool of dopamine, cocaine was still capable of elevating dopamine levels. This suggests that cocaine enhances dopamine release by mobilizing a reserve pool of dopamine-containing synaptic vesicles. To test this hypothesis, we examined electrically evoked dopamine release in synapsin I/II/III triple knock-out mice, which have impaired synaptic vesicle reserve pools. Knock-out of  synapsins greatly reduced the ability of cocaine to enhance dopamine release with long stimulus trains or after depletion of the newly synthesized pool. We therefore conclude that cocaine enhances dopamine release and does so by mobilizing a synapsin-dependent reserve pool of dopamine-containing synaptic vesicles. This capacity to enhance exocytotic release of dopamine may be important for the psychostimulant actions of cocaine.", "25925480": "Author information:  (1)1] The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA [2] Neuroscience Graduate Program, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA.

Depression alters the  pain threshold and impairs functional recovery. To date, however, there has been  limited understanding of synaptic or circuit mechanisms that regulate depression  in the pain state. Here, we demonstrate that depression-like behaviors are induced in a rat model of chronic neuropathic pain. Using this model, we show that chronic pain selectively increases the level of GluA1 subunits of AMPA-type  glutamate receptors at the synapses of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key component of the brain reward system. We find, in addition, that this increase in GluA1 levels leads to the formation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CPARs).  Surprisingly, pharmacologic blockade of these CPARs in the NAc increases depression-like behaviors associated with pain. Consistent with these findings, an AMPA receptor potentiator delivered into the NAc decreases pain-induced depression. These results show that transmission through CPARs in the NAc represents a novel molecular mechanism modulating the depressive symptoms of pain, and thus CPARs may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of pain-induced depression. More generally, these findings highlight the role of central glutamate signaling in pain states and define the brain reward system as  an important region for the regulation of depressive symptoms of pain.", "17582328": "The AMPA receptor (AMPAR) GluR2 subunit dictates the critical biophysical properties of the receptor, strongly influences receptor assembly and trafficking, and plays pivotal roles in a number of forms of long-term synaptic plasticity. Most neuronal AMPARs contain this critical subunit; however, in certain restricted neuronal populations and under certain physiological or pathological conditions, AMPARs that lack this subunit are expressed. There is a  current surge of interest in such GluR2-lacking Ca2+-permeable AMPARs in how they affect the regulation of synaptic transmission. Here, we bring together recent data highlighting the novel and important roles of GluR2 in synaptic function and plasticity.", "27007845": "A marked bias towards risk aversion has been observed in nearly every species tested. A minority of individuals, however, instead seem to prefer risk (repeatedly choosing uncertain large rewards over certain but smaller rewards), and even risk-averse individuals sometimes opt for riskier alternatives. It is not known how neural activity underlies such important shifts in decision-making--either as a stable trait across individuals or at the level of variability within individuals. Here we describe a model of risk-preference in rats, in which stable individual differences, trial-by-trial choices, and responses to pharmacological agents all parallel human behaviour. By combining new genetic targeting strategies with optical recording of neural activity during behaviour in this model, we identify relevant temporally specific signals from a  genetically and anatomically defined population of neurons. This activity occurred within dopamine receptor type-2 (D2R)-expressing cells in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), signalled unfavourable outcomes from the recent past at a time appropriate for influencing subsequent decisions, and also predicted subsequent choices made. Having uncovered this naturally occurring neural correlate of risk  selection, we then mimicked the temporally specific signal with optogenetic control during decision-making and demonstrated its causal effect in driving risk-preference. Specifically, risk-preferring rats could be instantaneously converted to risk-averse rats with precisely timed phasic stimulation of NAc D2R  cells. These findings suggest that individual differences in risk-preference, as  well as real-time risky decision-making, can be largely explained by the encoding in D2R-expressing NAc cells of prior unfavourable outcomes during decision-making.", "26733783": "During Pavlovian conditioning, a conditioned stimulus (CS) may act as a predictor of a reward to be delivered in another location. Individuals vary widely in their propensity to engage with the CS (sign tracking) or with the site of eventual reward (goal tracking). It is often assumed that sign tracking involves the association of the CS with the motivational value of the reward, resulting in the CS acquiring incentive value independent of the outcome. However, experimental evidence for this assumption is lacking. In order to test the hypothesis that sign tracking behavior does not rely on a neural representation of the outcome, we employed a reward devaluation procedure. We trained rats on a classic Pavlovian paradigm in which a lever CS was paired with a sucrose reward, then devalued the reward by pairing sucrose with illness in the absence of the CS. We  found that sign tracking behavior was enhanced, rather than diminished, following reward devaluation; thus, sign tracking is clearly independent of a representation of the outcome. In contrast, goal tracking behavior was decreased  by reward devaluation. Furthermore, when we divided rats into those with high propensity to engage with the lever (sign trackers) and low propensity to engage  with the lever (goal trackers), we found that nearly all of the effects of devaluation could be attributed to the goal trackers. These results show that sign tracking and goal tracking behavior may be the output of different associative structures in the brain, providing insight into the mechanisms by which reward-associated stimuli-such as drug cues-come to exert control over behavior in some individuals.", "21613588": "Neurons are functionally segregated into discrete populations that perform specific computations. These computations, mediated by neuron-neuron electrochemical signaling, form the neural basis of behavior. Thus fundamental to a brain-based understanding of behavior is the precise determination of the contribution made by specific neurotransmitters to behaviorally relevant neural activity. To facilitate this understanding, we have developed a cannulated microelectrode array for use in behaving rats that enables simultaneous neural ensemble recordings and local infusion of drugs in the same brain nucleus. The system is inexpensive, easy to use, and produces robust and quantitatively reproducible drug effects on recorded neurons.", "18463262": "Cue-elicited phasic changes in firing of nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons can facilitate reward-seeking behavior. Here, we test the hypothesis that the medial  prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which sends a dense glutamatergic projection to the NAc core, contributes to NAc neuronal firing responses to reward-predictive cues. Rats trained to perform an operant response to a cue for sucrose were implanted with recording electrodes in the core of the NAc and microinjection cannulas in the dorsal mPFC (dmPFC). The cue-evoked firing of NAc neurons was reduced by bilateral injection of GABA(A) and GABA(B) agonists into the dmPFC concomitant with loss of behavioral responding to the cue. In addition, unilateral dmPFC inactivation reduced ipsilateral cue excitations and contralateral cue inhibitions. These findings indicate that cue-evoked excitations and inhibitions  of NAc core neurons depend on dmPFC projections to the NAc and that these phasic  changes contribute to the behavioral response to reward-predictive cues.", "17072591": "INTRODUCTION: Debate continues over the precise causal contribution made by mesolimbic dopamine systems to reward. There are three competing explanatory categories: 'liking', learning, and 'wanting'. Does dopamine mostly mediate the hedonic impact of reward ('liking')? Does it instead mediate learned predictions  of future reward, prediction error teaching signals and stamp in associative links (learning)? Or does dopamine motivate the pursuit of rewards by attributing incentive salience to reward-related stimuli ('wanting')? Each hypothesis is evaluated here, and it is suggested that the incentive salience or 'wanting' hypothesis of dopamine function may be consistent with more evidence than either  learning or 'liking'. In brief, recent evidence indicates that dopamine is neither necessary nor sufficient to mediate changes in hedonic 'liking' for sensory pleasures. Other recent evidence indicates that dopamine is not needed for new learning, and not sufficient to directly mediate learning by causing teaching or prediction signals. By contrast, growing evidence indicates that dopamine does contribute causally to incentive salience. Dopamine appears necessary for normal 'wanting', and dopamine activation can be sufficient to enhance cue-triggered incentive salience. Drugs of abuse that promote dopamine signals short circuit and sensitize dynamic mesolimbic mechanisms that evolved to attribute incentive salience to rewards. Such drugs interact with incentive salience integrations of Pavlovian associative information with physiological state signals. That interaction sets the stage to cause compulsive 'wanting' in addiction, but also provides opportunities for experiments to disentangle 'wanting', 'liking', and learning hypotheses. Results from studies that exploited those opportunities are described here. CONCLUSION: In short, dopamine's contribution appears to be chiefly to cause 'wanting' for hedonic rewards, more than 'liking' or learning for those rewards.", "17031711": "RATIONALE: Dopamine neurotransmission has long been known to exert a powerful influence over the vigor, strength, or rate of responding. However, there exists  no clear understanding of the computational foundation for this effect; predominant accounts of dopamine's computational function focus on a role for phasic dopamine in controlling the discrete selection between different actions and have nothing to say about response vigor or indeed the free-operant tasks in  which it is typically measured. OBJECTIVES: We seek to accommodate free-operant behavioral tasks within the realm of models of optimal control and thereby capture how dopaminergic and motivational manipulations affect response vigor. METHODS: We construct an average reward reinforcement learning model in which subjects choose both which action to perform and also the latency with which to perform it. Optimal control balances the costs of acting quickly against the benefits of getting reward earlier and thereby chooses a best response latency. RESULTS: In this framework, the long-run average rate of reward plays a key role  as an opportunity cost and mediates motivational influences on rates and vigor of responding. We review evidence suggesting that the average reward rate is reported by tonic levels of dopamine putatively in the nucleus accumbens. CONCLUSIONS: Our extension of reinforcement learning models to free-operant tasks unites psychologically and computationally inspired ideas about the role of tonic dopamine in striatum, explaining from a normative point of view why higher levels of dopamine might be associated with more vigorous responding.", "16641388": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is necessary for the expression of Pavlovian-conditioned approach behavior but not for the expression of instrumental behavior conditioned in sessions that set a low response requirement. Although numerous studies have characterized firing patterns of NAc  neurons in relation to instrumental behavior, very little is known about how NAc  neurons encode information in Pavlovian tasks. In the present study, recordings of accumbal firing patterns were made during sessions in which rats performed a Pavlovian-conditioned approach task. Most of the recorded neurons (74/83, 89%) exhibited significant responses during the conditioned stimulus (CS) presentation and/or the reward exposure. The reward responses were prevalent, predominantly inhibitory, and comparable to reward responses observed in various types of behavioral paradigms, including instrumental tasks. The CS responses could be segregated into multiple subtypes on the basis of directionality, onset latency,  and duration. Several characteristics of the CS firing patterns were unique relative to cue responses observed previously during alternative types of conditioning sessions. It is possible that the novel firing patterns correspond to the differential contributions of the accumbens to Pavlovian-conditioned approach behavior and instrumentally conditioned behavior. Regardless, the novel  patterns of firing add to existing evidence that characterization of accumbal firing patterns in Pavlovian tasks may provide additional information about the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate accumbal contributions to behavior.", "16553795": "Environmental stimuli predictive of appetitive events can elicit Pavlovian approach responses that enhance an organism's ability to track and secure natural rewards, but may also contribute to the compulsive nature of drug addiction. Here, we examined the activity of individual nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons during an autoshaping paradigm. One conditioned stimulus (CS+, a retractable lever presented for 10 s) was immediately followed by the delivery of a 45-mg sucrose pellet to a food receptacle, while another stimulus (CS-, a separate retractable lever presented for 10 s) was never followed by sucrose. Approach responses directed at the CS+ and CS- were recorded as lever presses and had no experimental consequence. Rats (n = 9) selectively approached the CS+ on more than 80% of trials and were surgically prepared for electrophysiological recording. Of 76 NAc neurons, 57 cells (75%) exhibited increases and/or decreases in firing rate (i.e. termed 'phasically active') during the CS+ presentation and  corresponding approach response. Forty-seven percent of phasically active cells (27 out of 57) were characterized by time-locked but transient increases in cell  firing, while 53% (30 out of 57) showed a significant reduction in firing for the duration of the CS+. In contrast, the same excitatory subpopulation exhibited smaller increases in activity relative to CS- onset, while the inhibitory subpopulation showed no change in firing during the CS- period. The magnitude and prevalence of cue-related neural responses reported here indicates that the NAc encodes biologically significant, repetitive approach responses that may model the compulsive nature of drug addiction in humans.", "16226842": "The nucleus accumbens is thought to subserve different aspects of adaptive and emotional behaviors. The anatomical substrates for such actions are multiple, parallel ventral striatopallidal output circuits originating in the nucleus accumbens shell and core subregions. Several indirect ways of interaction between the two subregions and their associated circuitry have been proposed, in particular through striato-pallido-thalamic and dopaminergic pathways. In this study, using anterograde neuroanatomical tracing with Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and biotinylated dextran amine as well as single-cell juxtacellular filling with neurobiotin, we investigated the intra-accumbens distribution of local axon collaterals for the identification of possible direct  connections between the shell and core subregions. Our results show widespread intra-accumbens projection patterns, including reciprocal projections between specific parts of the shell and core. However, fibers originating in the core reach more distant areas of the shell, including the rostral pole (i.e. the calbindin-poor part of the shell anterior to the core) and striatal parts of the  olfactory tubercle, than those arising in the shell and projecting to the core. The latter projections are more restricted to the border region between the shell and core. The density of the fiber labeling within both the shell and core was very similar. Moreover, specific intrinsic projections within shell and core were identified, including a relatively strong projection from the rostral pole to the rostral shell, reciprocal projections between the rostral and caudal shell, as well as projections within the core that have a caudal-to-rostral predominance. The results of the juxtacellular filling experiments show that medium-sized spiny projection neurons and medium-sized aspiny neurons (most likely fast-spiking) contribute to these intra-accumbens projections. While such neurons are GABAergic, the intrastriatal projection patterns indicate the existence of lateral inhibitory interactions within, as well as between, shell and core subregions of the nucleus accumbens.", "15044531": "Reward-predictive cues exert powerful control over behavioral choice and may be a critical factor in drug addiction. Reward-seeking elicited by predictive cues is  facilitated by the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), yet the contribution of dopamine to the specific NAc firing patterns that underlie goal-directed behavior has remained elusive. We present evidence that subpopulations of NAc neurons that respond to predictive cues require the dopaminergic projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to promote reward-seeking behavior. Rats trained to perform an operant response to a cue to  obtain a sucrose reward were implanted with both multiunit recording electrodes in the NAc and microinjection cannulas in the VTA. Both the behavioral response to cues and the cue-evoked firing of NAc neurons were blocked by injection of the GABA(B) agonist baclofen into the VTA. An additional group of rats was trained on the same task and then implanted with microinjection cannulas in the NAc. Like VTA baclofen injection, injection of dopamine receptor antagonists into the NAc profoundly reduced cue-elicited reward seeking. Together, these results support the conclusion that both the behavioral response to the cue and the specific NAc  neuronal firing that promotes the response depend on dopamine release within the  NAc. Our findings suggest a neural mechanism by which the dopamine-dependent firing of NAc neurons mediates goal-directed behavior.", "12148923": "The nucleus accumbens core (AcbC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) are required for normal acquisition of tasks based  on stimulus-reward associations. However, it is not known whether they are involved purely in the learning process or are required for behavioral expression of a learned response. Rats were trained preoperatively on a Pavlovian autoshaping task in which pairing a visual conditioned stimulus (CS+) with food causes subjects to approach the CS+ while not approaching an unpaired stimulus (CS-). Subjects then received lesions of the AcbC, ACC, or CeA before being retested. AcbC lesions severely impaired performance; lesioned subjects approached the CS+ significantly less often than controls, failing to discriminate between the CS+ and CS-. ACC lesions also impaired performance but did not abolish discrimination entirely. CeA lesions had no effect on performance. Thus, the CeA is required for learning, but not expression, of a conditioned approach response, implying that it makes a specific contribution to  the learning of stimulus-reward associations.", "19038213": "The dorsal striatum, which consists of the caudate and putamen, is the gateway to the basal ganglia. It receives convergent excitatory afferents from cortex and thalamus and forms the origin of the direct and indirect pathways, which are distinct basal ganglia circuits involved in motor control. It is also a major site of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Striatal plasticity alters the transfer of information throughout basal ganglia circuits and may represent a key neural substrate for adaptive motor control and procedural memory. Here, we review current understanding of synaptic plasticity in the striatum and its role  in the physiology and pathophysiology of basal ganglia function.", "12721372": "Drug addiction poses serious social, medical, and economic problems, but effective treatments for drug addiction are still limited. Cocaine and morphine elevate dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and the overwhelming actions of dopamine are implicated in reinforcement and addiction of abusive drugs. In our previous studies, we reported the regulatory role of acetylcholine  (ACh) in the NAc function by selectively ablating the NAc cholinergic neurons with use of immunotoxin-mediated cell targeting. These studies indicated that ACh and dopamine acted convergently but oppositely on the NAc circuit and that cholinergic cell ablation enhanced long-lasting behavioral changes of cocaine addiction. In this investigation, we showed that immunotoxin-mediated ablation of the NAc cholinergic neurons enhanced not only the sensitivity to morphine in conditioned place preference but also negative reinforcement of morphine withdrawal in conditioned place aversion. Remarkably, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors that act on the brain AChE suppressed both cocaine- and morphine-induced conditioned place preference and blocked the induction and persistence of cocaine-evoked hyperlocomotion. Importantly, this inhibition was abolished by ablation of the NAc cholinergic neurons. These results demonstrate that centrally active AChE inhibitors prevent long-lasting behavioral abnormalities associated with cocaine and morphine addictions by potentiating the actions of ACh released from the NAc cholinergic neurons. Centrally active AChE inhibitors could thus be approached as novel and potential therapeutic agents for drug addiction.", "24735820": "This review covers the intrinsic organization and afferent and efferent connections of the midbrain dopaminergic complex, comprising the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and retrorubral field, which house, respectively, the A9, A10 and A8 groups of nigrostriatal, mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic neurons. In addition, A10dc (dorsal, caudal) and A10rv (rostroventral) extensions into, respectively, the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and supramammillary nucleus are discussed. Associated intrinsic and extrinsic connections of the midbrain dopaminergic complex that utilize gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and neuropeptides and various co-expressed combinations of these compounds are considered in conjunction with the dopamine-containing systems. A framework is provided for understanding the organization of massive afferent systems descending and ascending to the midbrain dopaminergic complex from the telencephalon and brainstem, respectively. Within the context of this framework, the basal ganglia direct and indirect output pathways are treated in some detail. Findings from rodent brain are briefly compared with those from primates, including humans. Recent literature is emphasized, including traditional experimental neuroanatomical and modern gene transfer and optogenetic studies.

Progress is aided by recognizing that affect has both objective and subjective features. Those dual aspects reflect that affective reactions are generated by neural mechanisms, selected in evolution based on their real (objective) consequences for genetic fitness. We review evidence for neural representation of pleasure in the brain (gained largely from neuroimaging  studies), and evidence for the causal generation of pleasure (gained largely from brain manipulation studies). We suggest that representation and causation may actually reflect somewhat separable neuropsychological functions. Representation  reaches an apex in limbic regions of prefrontal cortex, especially orbitofrontal  cortex, influencing decisions and affective regulation. Causation of core pleasure or 'liking' reactions is much more subcortically weighted, and sometimes surprisingly localized. Pleasure 'liking' is especially generated by restricted hedonic hotspot circuits in nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral pallidum. Another example of localized valence generation, beyond hedonic hotspots, is an affective keyboard mechanism in NAc for releasing intense motivations such as either positively valenced desire and/or negatively valenced dread.", "21217764": "Music, an abstract stimulus, can arouse feelings of euphoria and craving, similar to tangible rewards that involve the striatal dopaminergic system. Using the neurochemical specificity of [(11)C]raclopride positron emission tomography scanning, combined with psychophysiological measures of autonomic nervous system  activity, we found endogenous dopamine release in the striatum at peak emotional  arousal during music listening. To examine the time course of dopamine release, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging with the same stimuli and listeners, and found a functional dissociation: the caudate was more involved during the anticipation and the nucleus accumbens was more involved during the experience of peak emotional responses to music. These results indicate that intense pleasure in response to music can lead to dopamine release in the striatal system. Notably, the anticipation of an abstract reward can result in dopamine release in an anatomical pathway distinct from that associated with the  peak pleasure itself. Our results help to explain why music is of such high value across all human societies.", "11573015": "We used positron emission tomography to study neural mechanisms underlying intensely pleasant emotional responses to music. Cerebral blood flow changes were measured in response to subject-selected music that elicited the highly pleasurable experience of \"shivers-down-the-spine\" or \"chills.\" Subjective reports of chills were accompanied by changes in heart rate, electromyogram, and  respiration. As intensity of these chills increased, cerebral blood flow increases and decreases were observed in brain regions thought to be involved in  reward/motivation, emotion, and arousal, including ventral striatum, midbrain, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral medial prefrontal cortex. These brain structures are known to be active in response to other euphoria-inducing stimuli, such as food, sex, and drugs of abuse. This finding links music with biologically relevant, survival-related stimuli via their common recruitment of brain circuitry involved in pleasure and reward.", "21338616": "Previously, it was shown that ethanol-dependent animals display increased sensitivity to the general opioid receptor antagonist nalmefene compared to naltrexone. It was hypothesized that the dissociable effects of the two antagonists were attributable to a \u03ba-opioid receptor mechanism. Nucleus accumbens dynorphin is upregulated following chronic ethanol exposure and such neuroadaptations could contribute to nalmefene's increased potency in ethanol-dependent animals. To test this hypothesis, male Wistar rats were trained to self-administer ethanol using an operant conditioning procedure. Animals were  then implanted with bilateral intra-accumbens shell guide cannulae and assigned to either a chronic intermittent ethanol vapor-exposure condition (to induce dependence) or an air-exposed control group. Following a one-month exposure period, nalmefene, nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI; selective for \u03ba-opioid receptors) or a combination of the selective opioid receptor antagonists CTOP and naltrindole (selective for the \u03bc- and \u03b4-opioid receptors, respectively) were site-specifically infused into the nucleus accumbens shell prior to ethanol self-administration sessions during acute withdrawal. Nalmefene and CTOP/naltrindole dose-dependently reduced ethanol self-administration in nondependent and dependent animals, whereas nor-BNI selectively attenuated ethanol self-administration in ethanol-dependent animals without affecting the self-administration of nondependent animals. Further analysis indentified that intra-accumbens shell nalmefene was more potent in ethanol-dependent animals and  that the increased potency was attributable to a \u03ba-opioid receptor mechanism. These data support the concept that dysregulation of DYN/\u03ba-opioid receptor systems contributes to the excessive self-administration observed in dependent animals and suggest that pharmacotherapeutics for ethanol dependence that target  \u03ba-opioid receptors, in addition to \u03bc- and \u03b4-opioid receptors, are preferable to those that target \u03bc- and \u03b4-opioid receptor mechanisms alone.", "20401607": "BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: The dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system has been implicated as a critical component of the stress response. Stress-induced activation of dynorphin-KOR is well known to produce analgesia, and more recently, it has been implicated as a mediator of stress-induced responses including anxiety, depression, and reinstatement of drug seeking. OBJECTIVE: Drugs selectively targeting specific KOR signaling pathways may prove  potentially useful as therapeutic treatments for mood and addiction disorders. RESULTS: KOR is a member of the seven transmembrane spanning (7TM) G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. KOR activation of pertussis toxin-sensitive  G proteins leads to Galphai/o inhibition of adenylyl cyclase production of cAMP and releases Gbetagamma, which modulates the conductances of Ca(+2) and K(+) channels. In addition, KOR agonists activate kinase cascades including G-protein  coupled Receptor Kinases (GRK) and members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family: ERK1/2, p38 and JNK. Recent pharmacological data suggests that GPCRs exist as dynamic, multi-conformational protein complexes that can be directed by specific ligands towards distinct signaling pathways. Ligand-induced  conformations of KOR that evoke beta-arrestin-dependent p38 MAPK activation result in aversion; whereas ligand-induced conformations that activate JNK without activating arrestin produce long-lasting inactivation of KOR signaling. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we discuss the current status of KOR signal transduction research and the data that support two novel hypotheses: (1) KOR selective partial agonists that do not efficiently activate p38 MAPK may be useful analgesics without producing the dysphoric or hallucinogenic effects of selective, highly efficacious KOR agonists and (2) KOR antagonists that do not activate JNK may be effective short-acting drugs that may promote stress-resilience.", "19673744": "BACKGROUND: Excessive alcohol drinking continues to be an important health problem. Recent studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that animal models of ethanol dependence and relapse can contribute to understanding factors that contribute to excessive drinking. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the amount and duration of ethanol exposure is critical for promoting the escalation in drinking by mice given access to ethanol in a limited access paradigm. METHODS: We used several methods of chronic intermittent ethanol exposure in male C57BL/6J mice that would vary in the amount and duration of exposure to ethanol as indicated by blood ethanol concentrations (BEC). After establishing baseline drinking in the mice using a 2 hours, 2 bottle choice drinking paradigm, each study involved alternating between periods of ethanol exposure and periods of limited access to ethanol (1 cycle) for a total of 3 cycles. In Study 1, mice were allowed extended access (16 hours) to ethanol for oral consumption or remained in the home cage. In Study 2, the ethanol exposure consisted of intragastric gavage of increasing doses of ethanol or isocaloric sucrose as the control. Study 3 compared intragastric gavage combined with pyrazole, an alcohol  dehydrogenase inhibitor, with vapor inhalation of ethanol using procedures known  to lead to increased drinking in mice. Finally, Study 4 was a retrospective review of several studies conducted in our laboratory using inhalation procedures. The retrospective review encompassed a range of postvapor chamber BEC values and ethanol intakes that would allow a relationship between increased drinking and BEC to be examined. RESULTS: Allowing mice to drink for longer periods of time did not cause increased drinking in subsequent limited access sessions. Likewise, gastric intubation of ethanol which produced high BEC (>300 mg/dl) with or without pyrazole did not increase drinking. Only the vapor inhalation procedure, which was associated with sustained BEC above 175 mg/dl for the entire exposure period  resulted in increased drinking. The retrospective study provided further evidence that sustained BEC levels above 175 mg/dl was critical to the escalation in drinking. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the intensity (amount) and duration of ethanol exposure, indexed by BEC, is critical to produce increased drinking in mice. Specifically, BEC must regularly exceed 175 mg/dl for the escalation in drinking  to occur. Future studies will examine neurobiological adaptations that may underlie the increased drinking behavior caused by chronic intermittent ethanol exposure.", "18702645": "BACKGROUND: We have developed an animal model of alcohol self-administration that initially employs schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) to establish reliable ethanol consumption under open access (22 h/d) conditions with food and water concurrently available. SIP is an adjunctive behavior that is generated by constraining access to an important commodity (e.g., flavored food). The induction schedule and ethanol polydipsia generated under these conditions affords the opportunity to investigate the development of drinking typologies that lead to chronic, excessive alcohol consumption. METHODS: Adult male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were induced to drink water and 4% (w/v in water) ethanol by a Fixed-Time 300 seconds (FT-300 seconds) schedule of banana-flavored pellet delivery. The FT-300 seconds schedule was in effect for 120 consecutive sessions, with daily induction doses increasing from 0.0 to 0.5 g/kg to 1.0 g/kg to 1.5 g/kg every 30 days. Following induction,  the monkeys were allowed concurrent access to 4% (w/v) ethanol and water for 22 h/day for 12 months. RESULTS: Drinking typographies during the induction of drinking 1.5 g/kg ethanol  emerged that were highly predictive of the daily ethanol intake over the next 12  months. Specifically, the frequency in which monkeys ingested 1.5 g/kg ethanol without a 5-minute lapse in drinking (defined as a bout of drinking) during induction strongly predicted (correlation 0.91) subsequent ethanol intake over the next 12 months of open access to ethanol. Blood ethanol during induction were highly correlated with intake and with drinking typography and ranged from 100 to 160 mg% when the monkeys drank their 1.5 g/kg dose in a single bout. Forty percent of the population became heavy drinkers (mean daily intakes >3.0 g/kg for 12 months) characterized by frequent \"spree\" drinking (intakes >4.0 g/kg/d). CONCLUSION: This model of ethanol self-administration identifies early alcohol drinking typographies (gulping the equivalent of 6 drinks) that evolve into chronic heavy alcohol consumption in primates (drinking the equivalent of 16 to 20 drinks per day). The model may aid in identifying biological risks for establishing harmful alcohol drinking.", "24744379": "Typical therapies try to reverse pathogenic mechanisms. Here, we describe treatment effects achieved by enhancing depression-causing mechanisms in ventral  tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons. In a social defeat stress model of depression, depressed (susceptible) mice display hyperactivity of VTA DA neurons, caused by an up-regulated hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)). Mice resilient to social defeat stress, however, exhibit stable normal firing of these neurons. Unexpectedly, resilient mice had an even larger I(h), which was observed in parallel with increased potassium (K(+)) channel currents. Experimentally further enhancing Ih or optogenetically increasing the hyperactivity of VTA DA neurons in susceptible mice completely reversed depression-related behaviors, an  antidepressant effect achieved through resilience-like, projection-specific homeostatic plasticity. These results indicate a potential therapeutic path of promoting natural resilience for depression treatment.", "21508225": "The dopaminergic innervation of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is implicated in the  selection and integration of motivationally relevant corticolimbic information that governs behavioral output. However, it is unknown whether the dopaminergic innervations of two anatomically distinct subregions of the NAc, core and shell,  have differential roles in this gating process, and whether dopaminergic mechanisms are important in regulating the balance of limbic control over appetitive behavior at the point of learning. Having previously shown that repeated systemic pretreatment with amphetamine disrupts the regulation of competing limbic control over appetitive behavior in mice, we hereby examined the effects of repeated pretraining intra-NAc shell or core microinfusions of D-amphetamine, general dopamine (DA) receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol, or vehicle solution (saline) upon a simultaneously acquired conditioned cue and place preference task in rats. Repeated infusions of amphetamine into the NAc shell and core had opposite effects on the acquisition of conditioned place preference by significantly enhancing and attenuating, respectively, hippocampal-dependent place conditioning. In contrast, direct infusions of flupenthixol into the NAc shell attenuated place conditioning, while NAc core flupenthixol infusions not only attenuated cue conditioning, but also enhanced conditioned place preference. These findings implicate the NAc shell DA as being  necessary for enabling hippocampal-dependent spatial information to gain control  over appetitive learning, and the NAc core DA as being important for allowing basolateral amygdala-dependent information to gain control over appetitive learning. It is further proposed that NAc core DA may be critical in regulating limbic information flow through the NAc shell.", "18614688": "An important issue in affective neuroscience concerns the role of mesocorticolimbic dopamine systems in positive-valenced motivation (e.g., reward) versus negative-valenced motivation (e.g., fear). Here, we assessed whether endogenous dopamine receptor stimulation in nucleus accumbens contributes to both appetitive behavior and fearful behavior that is generated in keyboard manner by  local glutamate disruptions at different sites in medial shell. 6,7-Dinitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H,4H)-dione (DNQX) microinjections (450 ng) locally disrupt glutamate signals in <4 mm(3) of nucleus accumbens, and generate either desire or fear (or both) depending on precise rostrocaudal location in medial shell. At rostral shell sites, local AMPA/kainate blockade generates positive ingestive behavior, but the elicited motivated behavior becomes incrementally more fearful as the same microinjection is moved caudally. A dopamine-blocking mixture of D(1) and D(2) antagonists (raclopride and SCH-23390 [R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5,-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride]) was combined here in the same microinjection with DNQX to assess  the role of endogenous local dopamine in mediating the DNQX-motivated behaviors.  We report that local dopamine blockade prevented DNQX microinjections from generating appetitive behavior (eating) in rostral shell, and equally prevented DNQX from generating fearful behavior (defensive treading) in caudal shell. We conclude that local dopamine is needed to enable disruptions of corticolimbic glutamate signals in shell to generate either positive incentive salience or negative fearful salience (valence depending on site and other conditions). Thus, dopamine interacts with localization of valence-biased glutamate circuits in medial shell to facilitate keyboard stimulation of both appetitive and fearful motivations.", "18272187": "Long-term changes in the efficacy of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the striatal complex are proposed to underlie motor learning and neuroadaptations leading to addiction. Dopamine and glutamate play key roles in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in the dorsal striatum, but their contribution to synaptic plasticity in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens, NAc) has been less extensively studied. We have examined the  role of dopamine, glutamate and GABA in the induction of LTP in mouse brain slices containing the NAc. High-frequency stimulation of glutamatergic inputs elicited LTP of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials/population spikes (fEPSP/PSs) in the core region of the NAc. GABA did not seem to participate in LTP induction because LTP was not altered in the presence of either a GABA(A)- (bicuculline) or a GABA(B)- (CGP 55845) receptor antagonist. However, the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390, but not the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride, impaired LTP. The dopamine reuptake blocker nomifensine also inhibited LTP induction. We found that group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) contribute to LTP induction because the mGluR1 antagonist LY 367385, or the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP, blocked LTP induction. Furthermore, the glutamate reuptake blocker DL-TBOA also impaired LTP. The present results demonstrate that dopamine and glutamate play critical roles in the mechanisms of  induction of LTP in the NAc through the activation of dopamine D1 receptors and group I mGluRs. However, LTP is negatively regulated when endogenous levels of dopamine or glutamate are elevated.", "11978804": "Author information:  (1)Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin-Madison Medical School, Madison, Wisconsin 53719, USA. aekelley@facstaff.wisc.edu", "26253543": "A decade ago, we hypothesized that drug addiction can be viewed as a transition from voluntary, recreational drug use to compulsive drug-seeking habits, neurally underpinned by a transition from prefrontal cortical to striatal control over drug seeking and taking as well as a progression from the ventral to the dorsal striatum. Here, in the light of burgeoning, supportive evidence, we reconsider and elaborate this hypothesis, in particular the refinements in our understanding of ventral and dorsal striatal mechanisms underlying goal-directed and habitual drug seeking, the influence of drug-associated Pavlovian-conditioned stimuli on drug seeking and relapse, and evidence for impairments in top-down prefrontal cortical inhibitory control over this behavior. We further review animal and human studies that have begun to define etiological factors and individual differences in the propensity to become addicted to drugs, leading to the description of addiction endophenotypes, especially for cocaine addiction.

The purpose of this review is to highlight the effects of addictive drug use on GLT-1 and glutamate uptake, and using GLT-1 as a target in addiction pharmacotherapy. Cocaine, opioids, ethanol, nicotine, amphetamines, and cannabinoids each affect GLT-1 expression and glutamate uptake, and restoring GLT-1 expression with N-acetylcysteine or ceftriaxone shows promise in correcting pre-clinical and clinical manifestations of drug addiction.", "25861699": "BACKGROUND: Cue-induced methamphetamine craving increases after prolonged forced  (experimenter-imposed) abstinence from the drug (incubation of methamphetamine craving). Here, we determined whether this incubation phenomenon would occur under conditions that promote voluntary (self-imposed) abstinence. We also determined the effect of the novel metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 positive allosteric modulator, AZD8529, on incubation of methamphetamine craving after forced or voluntary abstinence. METHODS: We trained rats to self-administer palatable food (6 sessions) and then  to self-administer methamphetamine under two conditions: 12 sessions (9 hours/day) or 50 sessions (3 hours/day). We then assessed cue-induced methamphetamine seeking in extinction tests after 1 or 21 abstinence days. Between tests, the rats underwent either forced abstinence (no access to the food- or drug-paired levers) or voluntary abstinence (achieved via a discrete choice procedure between methamphetamine and palatable food; 20 trials per day) for 19 days. We also determined the effect of subcutaneous injections of AZD8529  (20 and 40 mg/kg) on cue-induced methamphetamine seeking 1 day or 21 days after forced or voluntary abstinence. RESULTS: Under both training and abstinence conditions, cue-induced methamphetamine seeking in the extinction tests was higher after 21 abstinence days than after 1 day (incubation of methamphetamine craving). AZD8529 decreased  cue-induced methamphetamine seeking on day 21 but not day 1 of forced or voluntary abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: We introduce a novel animal model to study incubation of drug craving and cue-induced drug seeking after prolonged voluntary abstinence, mimicking the human condition of relapse after successful contingency management  treatment. Our data suggest that positive allosteric modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 should be considered for relapse prevention.", "25716852": "Previous studies suggest that pharmacological or molecular activation of the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) facilitates extinction of cocaine-seeking behavior. However, overexpression of CREB, which increases excitability of AcbSh  neurons, enhances cocaine-seeking behavior while producing depression-like behavior in tests of mood. These discrepancies may reflect activity in differential AcbSh outputs, including those to the lateral hypothalamus (LH), a target region known to influence addictive behavior and mood. Presently, it is unknown whether there is a causal link between altered activity in the AcbSh-LH pathway and changes in the motivation for cocaine. In this study, we used an optogenetics approach to either globally stimulate AcbSh neurons or to selectively stimulate AcbSh terminal projections in the LH, in rats self-administering cocaine. We found that stimulation of the AcbSh-LH pathway enhanced the motivation to self-administer cocaine in progressive ratio testing,  and led to long-lasting facilitation of cocaine-seeking behavior during extinction tests conducted after withdrawal from cocaine self-administration. In  contrast, global AcbSh stimulation reduced extinction responding. We compared these opposing motivational effects with effects on mood using the forced swim test, where both global AcbSh neuron and selective AcbSh-LH terminal stimulation  facilitated depression-like behavioral despair. Together, these findings suggest  that the AcbSh neurons convey complex, pathway-specific modulation of addiction and depression-like behavior, and that these motivation and mood phenomenon are dissociable.", "25326689": "Relapse to cocaine use necessitates remodeling excitatory synapses in the nucleus accumbens and synaptic reorganization requires matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) degradation of the extracellular matrix proteins.

Cue-induced heroin and nicotine relapse increased MMP activity, and increased MMP activity was required for both cocaine relapse and relapse-associated synaptic plasticity.", "24872549": "Environmental contexts previously associated with drug use provoke relapse to drug use in humans and reinstatement of drug seeking in animal models of drug relapse. We examined whether context-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking is  mediated by activation of context-selected nucleus accumbens neurons. We trained  rats to self-administer cocaine in Context A and extinguished their lever-pressing in a distinct Context B. On test day, reexposure to the cocaine-associated Context A reinstated cocaine seeking and increased expression  of the neural activity marker Fos in 3.3% of accumbens shell and 1.6% of accumbens core neurons. To assess a causal role for these activated neurons, we used the Daun02 inactivation procedure to selectively inactivate these neurons. We trained c-fos-lacZ transgenic rats to self-administer cocaine in Context A and extinguished their lever-pressing in Context B. On induction day, we exposed rats to either Context A or a novel Context C for 30 min and injected Daun02 or vehicle into accumbens shell or core 60 min later. On test day, 3 d after induction day, the ability of Context A to reinstate cocaine seeking and increase neuronal activity in accumbens shell was attenuated when Daun02 was previously injected after exposure to Context A. Daun02 injections after exposure to the novel Context C had no effect on context-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking despite much greater numbers of Fos-expressing neurons induced by Context C. Daun02 injections in accumbens core had no effect. Our data suggest that context-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking is mediated by activation of context-selected accumbens shell but not core neuronal ensembles.", "24671996": "Cholinergic transmission in the striatal complex is critical for the modulation of the activity of local microcircuits and dopamine release. Release of acetylcholine has been considered to originate exclusively from a subtype of striatal interneuron that provides widespread innervation of the striatum. Cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine (PPN) and laterodorsal tegmental (LDT) nuclei indirectly influence the activity of the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens through their innervation of dopamine and thalamic neurons, which in turn converge at the same striatal levels. Here we show that cholinergic neurons  in the brainstem also provide a direct innervation of the striatal complex. By the expression of fluorescent proteins in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)::Cre(+) transgenic rats, we selectively labeled cholinergic neurons in the rostral PPN, caudal PPN, and LDT. We show that cholinergic neurons topographically innervate wide areas of the striatal complex: rostral PPN preferentially innervates the dorsolateral striatum, and LDT preferentially innervates the medial striatum and nucleus accumbens core in which they principally form asymmetric synapses. Retrograde labeling combined with immunohistochemistry in wild-type rats confirmed the topography and cholinergic nature of the projection. Furthermore, transynaptic gene activation and conventional double retrograde labeling suggest that LDT neurons that innervate the nucleus accumbens also send collaterals to the thalamus and the dopaminergic  midbrain, thus providing both direct and indirect projections, to the striatal complex. The differential activity of cholinergic interneurons and cholinergic neurons of the brainstem during reward-related paradigms suggest that the two systems play different but complementary roles in the processing of information in the striatum.", "24612076": "Both pre-clinical and clinical studies indicate that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may be useful in treating relapse to addictive drug use. Cocaine self-administration  in rats reduces both cystine-glutamate exchange and glutamate transport via GLT-1 in the nucleus accumbens, and NAC treatment normalizes these two glial processes  critical for maintaining glutamate homeostasis. However, it is not known if one or both of these actions by NAC is needed to inhibit relapse to cocaine seeking.  To determine whether the restoration of GLT-1 and/or cystine-glutamate exchange is required for NAC to inhibit cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, we utilized the rat self-administration/extinction/reinstatement model of cocaine relapse. Rats were pre-treated in the nucleus accumbens with vivo-morpholino antisense oligomers targeting either GLT-1 or xCT (catalytic subunit of the cystine-glutamate exchanger) overlapping with daily NAC administration during extinction (100\u2009mg/kg, i.p. for the last 5 days). Rats then underwent cue-induced reinstatement of active lever pressing in the absence of NAC, to determine if preventing NAC-induced restoration of one or the other protein was sufficient to  block the capacity of chronic NAC to inhibit reinstatement. The vivo-morpholino suppression of xCT reduced cystine-glutamate exchange but did not affect NAC-induced reduction of reinstated cocaine seeking. In contrast, suppressing NAC-induced restoration of GLT-1 not only prevented NAC from inhibiting reinstatement, but augmented the capacity of cues to reinstate cocaine seeking. We hypothesized that the increased reinstatement after inhibiting NAC induction of GLT-1 resulted from increased extracellular glutamate, and show that augmented reinstatement is prevented by blocking mGluR5. Restoring GLT-1, not cystine-glutamate exchange, is a key mechanism whereby daily NAC reduces cue-induced cocaine reinstatement.", "24467847": "Idiopathic or alcohol-induced increases in the expression and function of the Group1 metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1) within the extended amygdala are theorized to contribute to an individual's propensity to consume excessive amounts of alcohol. In the past, the detailed study of the functional relevance of mGluR1 for alcoholism-related behaviors in animal models was hampered by the poor solubility and non-specific side effects of available inhibitors; however, the advent of the highly potent and soluble mGluR1 negative  allosteric modulator JNJ-16259685 [(3,4-Dihydro-2H-pyrano[2,3-b]quinolin-7-yl)-(cis-4-methoxycyclohexyl)-methanone] has instigated a re-examination of the role for this mGluR subtype in mediating the behavioral effects of alcohol. In this regard, systemic pretreatment with JNJ-16259685 was proven effective at reducing alcohol reinforcement and motivation for the drug. mGluR1 is a G\u03b1q/o-coupled receptor, the stimulation of which activates phospholipase C (PLC). Thus, the present study investigated potential neuroanatomical substrates and intracellular molecules involved in the  ability of JNJ-16259685 to reduce alcohol intake. JNJ-16259685 (0-30\u00a0pg/side) was infused into the shell subregion of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) of C57BL/6J and Homer2 knock-out (KO) mice, either alone or in combination with the PLC inhibitor U-73122 (5.8\u00a0fg/side). Alcohol intake was then assessed under Drinking-in-the-Dark (DID) procedures. Intra-NAC JNJ-16259685 infusion dose-dependently reduced alcohol consumption by C57BL/6J mice; this effect was not additive with that produced by U-73122, nor was it present in Homer2 KO animals. These data provide novel evidence in support of a critical role for mGluR1-PLC signaling, scaffolded by Homer2, within the NAC shell, in maintaining  alcohol consumption under limited access procedures. Such findings have relevance for both the pharmacotherapeutics and pharmacogenetics of risky alcohol drinking  and alcoholism.", "24399945": "Stimuli previously associated with drugs of abuse can become triggers that elicit craving and lead to drug-seeking behavior. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key neural structure involved in cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Previous studies have also implicated projections from the BLA directly to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in these behaviors. However, other structures critically  involved in cocaine seeking are targets of BLA innervation, including the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL). It has been shown that BLA or PL innervation direct to the NAc can modulate reward-related behaviors but the BLA also projects to the PL, and given the importance of the PL projection to the NAc for reinstated drug seeking, we hypothesized the BLA to PL projection may indirectly  influence behavior via PL innervation to the NAc. We delivered a virus expressing the inhibitory optogenetic construct ArchT into the BLA and implanted fiber optics above the injection site or axon terminal fields in either the NAc or PL.  Rats then went through 12 days of cocaine self-administration followed by extinction training. Following extinction, animals underwent cue-induced reinstatement sessions in the presence or absence of optical inhibition. Inactivation of the BLA and either the BLA core subcompartment of the NAc (BLA-to-NAcore) BLA-to-PL projections inhibited cue-induced reinstatement. These  data demonstrate that the BLA projection either directly into the NAc, or indirectly via the PL, is a necessary regulator of drug-seeking behavior.", "24126453": "Trafficking and stabilization of AMPA receptors at synapses in response to cocaine exposure is thought to be critical for expression of cocaine addiction and relapse. Glutamate receptor-interacting protein (GRIP) is a neuronal scaffolding protein that stabilizes GluA2 AMPARs at synapses but its role in cocaine addiction has not been examined. The current study demonstrates that conditional deletion of GRIP within the nucleus accumbens potentiates cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking without affecting operant learning, locomotor activity, or reinstatement of natural reward seeking. This is the first study to  demonstrate a role for accumbal GRIP in behavior. Electrophysiological recordings revealed increased rectification of AMPAR-mediated currents in the nucleus accumbens and increased AMPAR sensitivity to the GluA2-lacking AMPAR antagonist,  1-naphthylacetyl spermine, indicative of an increased contribution of GluA2-lacking calcium-permeable AMPARs. In addition, accumbal GRIP deletion was associated with blunted long-term depression, similar to what is seen following cocaine self-administration. Taken together, these results indicate that GRIP may modulate addictive phenotypes through its regulation of synaptic AMPARs by controlling their subunit composition and susceptibility to LTD. These effects are associated with changes in vulnerability to cocaine relapse and highlight GRIP as a novel target for the development of cocaine addiction therapeutics.", "23995583": "Methamphetamine (meth) addicts often exhibit enduring cognitive and neural deficits that likely contribute to persistent drug seeking and the high rates of  relapse. These deficits may be related to changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)  and its glutamatergic projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Here, we performed in vivo microdialysis in the PFC and NAc in rats following either meth  self-administration or yoked-saline control histories to assess baseline glutamate (GLU) levels, or reinstatement-evoked GLU and dopamine (DA) efflux in both regions simultaneously under cue-induced, meth-primed, or combined cues+meth reinstatement conditions. Our results show that meth self-administration (1) reduced basal GLU levels in both the dmPFC and NAc, (2) concurrently increased dmPFC and NAc GLU efflux during reinstatement, and (3) increased DA efflux in the dmPFC, but not in the NAc, under all reinstatement conditions when compared with  yoked-saline controls. These data demonstrate for the first time that a history of psychostimulant self-administration alters GLU homeostasis not only in the NAc, but also in the dmPFC, its primary GLU projection source. Furthermore, combined cues+meth-primed reinstatement conditions produced the most pronounced increases in mPFC and NAc extracellular GLU, suggesting that the cue and meth prime conditions are additive in promoting reinstatement. Finally, increased efflux of DA in the dmPFC, but not in the NAc, across reinstatement conditions suggests that DA release in the dmPFC may be an important mediator of drug seeking initiated by multiple relapse triggers.", "23966687": "The core subcompartment of the nucleus accumbens (NAcore) contributes significantly to behavioral responses following motivationally relevant stimuli,  including drug-induced, stress-induced, and cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine  seeking. Projections from NAcore that could carry information necessary to initiate reinstated cocaine seeking include outputs via the indirect pathway to the dorsolateral subcompartment of the ventral pallidum (dlVP) and through the direct pathway to the medial substantia nigra (SN). Here we used an optogenetic strategy to determine whether the dlVP or nigral projections from the NAcore are  necessary for cocaine seeking initiated by a cocaine and conditioned cue combination in rats extinguished from cocaine self-administration. Rats were pretreated in the NAcore with an adeno-associated virus expressing the inhibitory opsin archaerhodopsin, and fiber-optic cannulae were implanted above the indirect pathway axon terminal field in the dlVP, or the direct pathway terminal field in  the SN. Inhibiting the indirect pathway to the dlVP, but not the direct pathway to the SN, prevented cocaine-plus-cue-induced reinstatement. We also examined projections back to the NAcore from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and dlVP. Inhibiting the dlVP to NAcore projection did not alter, while inhibiting VTA afferents abolished reinstated cocaine seeking. Localization of green fluorescent protein reporter expression and whole-cell patch electrophysiology were used to verify opsin expression. These data reveal a circuit involving activation of VTA  inputs to the NAcore and NAcore projections through the indirect pathway to the dlVP as critical for cocaine-plus-cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking.", "23710649": "Cocaine addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease characterized by an inability to regulate drug-seeking behavior. Here we investigated the role of mGluR5 in the ventral and dorsal striatum in regulating cocaine-seeking following both abstinence and extinction. Animals underwent 2 weeks of cocaine self-administration followed by 3 weeks of home-cage abstinence. Animals were then reintroduced to the operant chamber for a context-induced relapse test, followed by 7-10 days of extinction training. Once responding was extinguished, cue-primed reinstatement test was conducted. Both drug-seeking tests were conducted in the presence of either mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator, MTEP or vehicle infused into either the nucleus accumbens (NA) core or dorsolateral striatum (dSTR). We found that MTEP infused in the NA core attenuated both context-induced relapse following abstinence and cue-primed reinstatement following extinction training. Blocking dSTR mGluR5 had no effect on context- or  cue-induced cocaine-seeking. However, the intra-dSTR MTEP infusion on the context-induced relapse test day attenuated extinction learning for 4 days after  the infusion. Furthermore, mGluR5 surface expression was reduced and LTD was absent in dSTR slices of animals undergoing 3 weeks of abstinence from cocaine but not sucrose self-administration. LTD was restored by bath application of VU-29, a positive allosteric modulator of mGluR5. Bath application of MTEP prevented the induction of LTD in dSTR slices from sucrose animals. Taken together, this data indicates that dSTR mGluR5 plays an essential role in extinction learning but not cocaine relapse, while NA core mGluR5 modulates drug-seeking following both extinction and abstinence from cocaine self-administration.", "23064228": "Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons have important roles in adaptive and pathological brain functions related to reward and motivation. However, it is unknown whether subpopulations of VTA dopamine neurons participate in distinct circuits that encode different motivational signatures, and whether inputs to the VTA differentially modulate such circuits. Here we show that, because of differences in synaptic connectivity, activation of inputs to the VTA from the laterodorsal tegmentum and the lateral habenula elicit reward and aversion in mice, respectively. Laterodorsal tegmentum neurons preferentially synapse on dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens lateral shell, whereas lateral habenula neurons synapse primarily on dopamine neurons projecting to the  medial prefrontal cortex as well as on GABAergic (\u03b3-aminobutyric-acid-containing) neurons in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus.

SNc and VTA dopamine neurons receive contrasting excitatory inputs: the former from the somatosensory/motor cortex and subthalamic nucleus, which may explain their short-latency responses to salient events; and the latter from the lateral hypothalamus, which may explain their involvement in value coding. We demonstrate that neurons in the striatum that project directly to dopamine neurons form patches in both the dorsal and ventral  striatum, whereas those projecting to GABAergic neurons are distributed in the matrix compartment.

Here, we investigated the effects of mGluR(2/3) stimulation on cue- and drug-primed reinstatement in rats with different histories of methamphetamine (METH) self-administration training, under two conditions: 16 daily sessions of short access (90 min/day, ShA), or 8 daily sessions of short access followed by 8 sessions of long access (6 h/day, LgA). Following self-administration and subsequent extinction training, rats were pretreated with the selective mGluR(2/3) agonist LY379268 (variable dose, 0-3 mg/kg), exposed to METH-paired cues or a priming injection of METH (1 mg/kg), and tested for reinstatement of METH-seeking behavior. LgA rats self-administered greater amounts of METH during  the second half of training, but when pretreated with vehicle, ShA and LgA rats showed cue- and drug-primed reinstatement at equivalent response rates. However,  LgA rats demonstrated greater sensitivity to mGluR(2/3) stimulation with attenuated responding during cue-induced reinstatement after 0.3 mg/kg and higher doses of LY379268, whereas ShA rats decreased cue-induced reinstatement behavior  following 1.0 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg LY379268. Additionally, both LgA and ShA rats exhibited decreased METH-primed reinstatement behavior following 0.3 mg/kg and higher doses of LY379268. A separate group of control rats was trained to self-administer sucrose pellets, and demonstrated attenuated cue-induced sucrose-seeking behavior following 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg LY379268.

Dopamine modulates excitatory glutamatergic signals from the prefrontal cortex, but the precise mechanism has not been identified. We combined optical and electrophysiology recordings in murine slice preparations from CB1 receptor-null  mice and green fluorescent protein hemizygotic bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice to show how dopamine regulates glutamatergic synapses specific to the striatonigral and striatopallidal basal ganglia pathways. At low cortical frequencies, dopamine D1 receptors promote glutamate release to both D1 and D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons while D2 receptors specifically inhibit  excitatory inputs to D2 receptor-expressing cells by decreasing exocytosis from cortical terminals with a low probability of release. At higher cortical stimulation frequencies, this dopaminergic modulation of presynaptic activity is  occluded by adenosine and endocannabinoids. Glutamatergic inputs to both D1 and D2 receptor-bearing medium spiny neurons are inhibited by adenosine, released upon activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors and adenylyl cyclase in D1 receptor-expressing cells. Excitatory inputs to D2 receptor-expressing cells are  specifically inhibited by endocannabinoids, whose release is dependent on D2 and  group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors. The convergence of excitatory and inhibitory modulation of corticoaccumbal activity by dopamine, adenosine and endocannabinoids creates subsets of corticoaccumbal inputs, selectively and temporally reinforces strong cortical signals through the striatonigral pathway while inhibiting the weak, and may provide a mechanism whereby continued attention might be focused on behaviourally salient information.", "22492053": "In humans, exposure to contexts previously associated with heroin use can provoke relapse. In rats, exposure to heroin-paired contexts after extinction of drug-reinforced responding in different contexts reinstates heroin seeking. This  effect is attenuated by inhibition of glutamate or dopamine transmission in nucleus accumbens shell, or inactivation of ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here, we used an anatomical asymmetrical disconnection procedure to demonstrate that an interaction between glutamatergic projections from ventral mPFC to accumbens shell and local dopamine D(1) postsynaptic receptors contributes to context-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. We also combined  the marker of neuronal activity, Fos, with the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold to assess activation in this pathway during context-induced reinstatement. Rats were trained to self-administer heroin for 12 d; drug infusions were paired with a discrete tone-light cue. Lever pressing was subsequently extinguished in a nondrug-associated context in the presence of the discrete cue. Rats were then tested in the heroin- or extinction-associated contexts under extinction conditions. Injections of muscimol + baclofen into ventral mPFC in one hemisphere and D(1)-family receptor antagonist SCH 23390 into the contralateral or ipsilateral accumbens shell decreased context-induced reinstatement. Unilateral injections of muscimol + baclofen into ventral mPFC or SCH 23390 into the accumbens shell had no effect. Context-induced reinstatement was associated with  increased Fos expression in ventral mPFC neurons, including those projecting to accumbens shell, with higher double-labeling in the ipsilateral projection than in the contralateral projection. Our results demonstrate that activation of glutamatergic projections from ventral mPFC to accumbens shell, previously implicated in inhibition of cocaine relapse, promotes heroin relapse.", "22340009": "In animal models of addiction, reducing glutamate stimulation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) inhibits drug-seeking. The present study used the reinstatement model of cocaine-seeking to show that blockade of mGluR5 directly in the core subcompartment of the nucleus accumbens (NAcore) prevented both conditioned cue- and cocaine-reinstated drug-seeking. Consistent with this finding, microinjection of the mGluR5 agonist (RS)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine into the NAcore produced modest reinstatement of lever pressing when given alone and significantly potentiated cue-induced reinstatement. Homer proteins are contained in the post-synaptic density and regulate mGluR5 intracellular signaling and trafficking to the membrane. Microinjecting a membrane permeable peptide antagonist of Homer binding to mGluR5 into the NAcore also inhibited cue- and cocaine-reinstated lever pressing. However, this peptide did not change the surface expression of mGluR5,  indicating that the peptide inhibitor did not alter the surface trafficking of mGluR5. Taken together, these data show that mGluR5 inhibition and stimulation in the NAcore can regulate cocaine-seeking, and demonstrate that one mechanism for this effect is via interactions with Homer proteins.", "22321070": "Following cocaine self-administration and extinction training, activity in the infralimbic cortex (IL) suppresses cocaine-seeking behavior. IL inactivation induces cocaine-seeking whereas activation suppresses cocaine-reinstated drug-seeking. We asked how the suppression of cocaine-seeking induced by IL activation integrates with the circuitry promoting reinstated cocaine-seeking. Following cocaine self-administration and extinction training, rats underwent cue-induced reinstatement. In order to activate IL projections, microinjections of PEPA, a positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors, were made into the IL in combination with microinjections into a variety of nuclei known to regulate cocaine-seeking. Intra-IL PEPA administration suppressed cue-induced reinstatement without affecting locomotor activity. The suppression of cocaine-seeking was reversed by activating dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area with microinjections of the \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist DAMGO, and was partially reversed by dopamine microinjections into the prelimbic cortex or basolateral amygdala. Previous evidence suggests that the nucleus accumbens shell both promotes and suppresses cocaine-seeking. The suppression of cue-induced cocaine seeking by PEPA in the IL was reversed by intra-shell microinjections of  either dopamine or the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX, suggesting that the accumbens shell bidirectionally regulates cocaine-seeking depending on whether dopamine input is mimicked or glutamate input is inhibited. Together, these findings indicate that the IL acts 'upstream' from structures promoting cocaine-seeking, including from the mesolimbic dopamine projections to the prelimbic cortex and basolateral amygdala, and that the accumbens shell may be a  crucial point of integration between the circuits that promote (ventral tegmental area) and inhibit (IL) reinstated cocaine-seeking.", "22030712": "Methamphetamine is a highly addictive psychomotor stimulant yet the neurobiological consequences of methamphetamine self-administration remain under-characterized. Thus, we employed microdialysis in rats trained to self-administer intravenous (IV) infusions of methamphetamine (METH-SA) or saline (SAL) and a group of rats receiving non-contingent IV infusions of methamphetamine (METH-NC) at 1 or 21 days withdrawal to determine the dopamine and glutamate responses in the nucleus accumbens (NAC) to a 2\u2009mg/kg methamphetamine intraperitoneal challenge. Furthermore, basal NAC extracellular glutamate content was assessed employing no net-flux procedures in these three groups at both time points. At both 1- and 21-day withdrawal points, methamphetamine elicited a rise in extracellular dopamine in SAL animals and this effect was sensitized in METH-NC rats. However, METH-SA animals showed a much greater sensitized dopamine response to the drug challenge compared with the other groups. Additionally, acute methamphetamine decreased extracellular glutamate in both SAL and METH-NC animals at both time-points. In contrast, METH-SA rats exhibited a modest and delayed rise in glutamate at 1-day withdrawal and this rise was sensitized at 21 days withdrawal. Finally, no net-flux microdialysis revealed elevated basal glutamate and increased extraction fraction at both withdrawal time-points in METH-SA rats. Although METH-NC rats exhibited no change in the glutamate extraction fraction, they exhibited a time-dependent elevation in basal glutamate levels. These data illustrate for the first time that a history of methamphetamine self-administration produces enduring changes in NAC neurotransmission and that non-pharmacological factors have a critical role in the expression of these methamphetamine-induced neurochemical adaptations.", "21653852": "The mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system plays important roles in reward, motivation, learning, memory, and movement. This system arises from the A10 region, comprising the ventral tegmental area and three adjacent midline nuclei (caudal linear nucleus, interfascicular nucleus, and rostral linear nucleus of the raphe). DAergic and GABAergic neurons are intermingled in this region with recently discovered glutamatergic neurons expressing the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2). Here, we show by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry that there are two subpopulations of neurons expressing VGluT2 mRNA in the A10 region: (1) a major subpopulation that expresses VGluT2 but lacks tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; VGluT2-only neurons), present in each nucleus of the A10 region, and (2) a smaller subpopulation that coexpresses VGluT2 and TH (VGluT2-TH neurons). By quantitative real-time PCR, we determined the mRNA copy numbers encoding VGluT2 or TH in samples of individual microdissected TH immunoreactive (IR) neurons. Data from both in situ hybridization and from mRNA quantification showed that VGluT2 mRNA is not present in every TH-IR neuron, but  restricted to a subset of TH-IR neurons located in the medial portion of the A10  region. By integration of tract tracing, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry, we found that VGluT2-only neurons and VGluT2-TH neurons each innervate both the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens. These findings establish that in addition to the well-recognized mesocorticolimbic DA-only and GABA-only pathways, there exist parallel mesocorticolimbic glutamate-only and glutamate-DA pathways.", "21521425": "The functional integrity of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) core and shell is necessary for contextual cocaine-seeking behavior in the reinstatement animal model of drug relapse; however, the neuropharmacological mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. The present study evaluated the contribution of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1 (mGluR1) and \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptor populations to drug context-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior. Rats were trained to lever press for un-signaled cocaine infusions in a distinct  context followed by extinction training in a different context. Cocaine-seeking behavior (non-reinforced active lever pressing) was then assessed in the previously cocaine-paired and extinction contexts after JNJ16259685 (mGluR1 antagonist: 0.0, 0.6, or 30\u2003pg/0.3\u2003\u00b5l/hemisphere) or CNQX (AMPA/kainate receptor  antagonist: 0.0, 0.03, or 0.3\u2003\u00b5g/0.3\u2003\u00b5l /hemisphere) administration into the NAC  core, medial or lateral NAC shell, or the ventral caudate-putamen (vCPu, anatomical control). JNJ16259685 or CNQX in the NAC core dose-dependently impaired contextual cocaine-seeking behavior relative to vehicle. Conversely, CNQX, but not JNJ16259685, in the lateral or medial NAC shell attenuated, whereas CNQX or JNJ16259685 in vCPu failed to inhibit, this behavior. The manipulations failed to alter instrumental behavior in the extinction context, general motor activity or food-reinforced instrumental behavior in control experiments. Thus, glutamate-mediated changes in drug context-induced motivation for cocaine involve distinct neuropharmacological mechanisms within the core and shell subregions of  the NAC, with the stimulation of mGlu1 and AMPA/kainate receptors in the NAC core and the stimulation of AMPA/kainate, but not mGlu1, receptors in the NAC shell being necessary for this phenomenon.", "21303898": "G protein-coupled dopamine receptors (D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5) mediate all of the  physiological functions of the catecholaminergic neurotransmitter dopamine, ranging from voluntary movement and reward to hormonal regulation and hypertension. Pharmacological agents targeting dopaminergic neurotransmission have been clinically used in the management of several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Huntington's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD(1)), and Tourette's syndrome. Numerous advances have occurred in understanding the general structural, biochemical, and functional properties of dopamine receptors that have led to the development of multiple pharmacologically active compounds that directly target dopamine receptors, such as antiparkinson drugs and antipsychotics. Recent progress in understanding the complex biology of dopamine receptor-related signal transduction mechanisms has revealed that, in addition to their primary action on cAMP-mediated signaling, dopamine receptors can act through diverse signaling mechanisms that involve alternative G protein coupling or through G protein-independent mechanisms via interactions with ion channels or proteins that are characteristically implicated in receptor desensitization, such as \u03b2-arrestins. One of the future directions in managing dopamine-related pathologic conditions may involve a transition from the approaches that directly affect receptor function to a precise targeting of postreceptor intracellular signaling modalities either directly or through ligand-biased signaling pharmacology. In this comprehensive review, we discuss dopamine receptor classification, their basic structural and genetic organization, their distribution and functions in the brain and the periphery, and their regulation and signal transduction mechanisms. In addition, we discuss  the abnormalities of dopamine receptor expression, function, and signaling that are documented in human disorders and the current pharmacology and emerging trends in the development of novel therapeutic agents that act at dopamine receptors and/or on related signaling events.", "20534846": "Learning to inhibit drug seeking can be an important strategy for inhibiting relapse, and this can be modeled by extinguishing drug seeking in response to a drug-paired context. Rats were either extinguished or withdrawn without extinction training (abstinence) from cocaine self-administration, and measurements of postsynaptic density proteins in the core and shell subcompartments of the nucleus accumbens were compared with yoked-saline controls. Only extinguished rats had elevations of PSD-95, Homer1b/c, and Narp in the postsynaptic density of the core, whereas no proteins measured were altered in the postsynaptic density of the shell in either extinguished or abstinent rats. Using a biotinylation strategy, it was found that surface expression of mGluR5 was reduced only in the core of extinguished animals. Although both extinguished and abstinent animals showed a reduction in long-term potentiation elicited in the core by stimulating prefrontal cortex, blunted long-term depression was observed only in extinguished rats. These data indicate that the elevation in Homer1b/c in the core may have sequestered mGluR5 away from the membrane surface and that the loss of surface mGluR5 inhibits long-term depression. Accordingly, when Homer1c was overexpressed in the core of cocaine-naive rats with an adenoassociated virus, long-term depression was inhibited. This mechanism may contribute to the inhibition of cocaine seeking by  extinction training because overexpression of Homer1c in the core also inhibited  cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. These data identify a cellular mechanism that may contribute to extinction-induced inhibition of cocaine seeking.", "20371233": "Drug addiction is characterized by maladaptive decision-making and dysfunctional  brain circuitry regulating motivated behaviors, resulting in loss of the behavioral flexibility needed to abstain from drug seeking. Hence, addicts face high risk of relapse even after prolonged periods of abstinence from drug use. This is thought to result from long-lasting drug-induced neuroadaptations of glutamate and dopaminergic transmission in the mesocorticolimbic and cortico-striatal circuits where group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu(2/3) receptors) are densely expressed. mGlu(2/3) receptors presynaptically  control glutamate as well as dopamine release throughout the mesocorticolimbic structures involved in reward processing and drug seeking, and their function is  reduced after prolonged exposure to drugs of abuse. In pre-clinical models, mGlu(2/3) receptors have been shown to regulate both reward processing and drug seeking, in part through the capacity to control release of dopamine and glutamate respectively. Specifically, mGlu(2/3) receptor agonists administered systemically or locally into certain brain structures reduce the rewarding value  of commonly abused drugs and inhibit the reinstatement of drug seeking. Given the ability of mGlu(2/3) receptor agonists to compensate for and possibly reverse drug-induced neuroadaptations in mesocorticolimbic circuitry, this class of receptors emerges as a new therapeutic target for reducing relapse in drug addiction.", "20180839": "Although the involvement of the medial prefrontal cortex projection to the nucleus accumbens in the reinstatement of cocaine seeking has been well studied,  it is not known if this projection plays a similar role in the reinstatement of cue- and methamphetamine-induced drug seeking in animals extinguished from methamphetamine self-administration. Accordingly, following extinction from long-access methamphetamine self-administration, rats were bilaterally microinjected with either a combination of the GABA agonists baclofen/muscimol or vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) into the infralimbic or prelimbic subcompartments of the medial prefrontal cortex or into the shell or core subcompartments of the nucleus accumbens. Similar to cocaine seeking, inactivation of either the prelimbic cortex or accumbens core eliminated cue- and methamphetamine-induced reinstatement, and inactivation of neither the infralimbic cortex nor shell subcompartments inhibited methamphetamine-induced drug seeking. However, in contrast to previous reports with cocaine, cue-induced  reinstatement of methamphetamine seeking was inhibited by inactivation of the infralimbic cortex. In conclusion, although a primary role in reinstated drug seeking by the prelimbic and the accumbens core is similar between cocaine and methamphetamine, the recruitment of the infralimbic cortex by conditioned cues differs between these two psychostimulant drugs.", "19924113": "Conditioned responding to drug-predictive discrete cues can be strongly modulated by drug-associated contexts. We tested the hypothesis that differential recruitment of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and shell mediates responding to  drug cues in a drug vs non-drug context. Rats were trained to discriminate between two 10-s auditory stimuli: one stimulus (CS+) was paired with ethanol (10% v/v; 0.2 ml; oral) whereas the other (CS-) was not. Training occurred in operant conditioning chambers distinguished by contextual stimuli, and resulted in increased entries into the ethanol delivery port during the CS+ when compared  with the CS-. In experiment 1, port entries were then extinguished in a second context by withholding ethanol, after which context-induced renewal of ethanol-seeking was tested by presenting both stimuli without ethanol in the previous training context. This manipulation stimulated strong responding to the  CS+ in rats pretreated with saline in the core (n=9) or shell (n=10), which was attenuated by pharmacologically inactivating (muscimol/baclofen; 0.1/1.0 mM; 0.3  microl/side) either subregion pretest. In experiment 2, after discrimination, training rats were habituated to a different context in which ethanol and both stimuli were withheld. Cue-induced ethanol-seeking was then elicited by presenting the CS+ and CS- without ethanol in the different context. Saline-pretreated rats responded more to the CS+ than the CS- (core n=8; shell n=9), and inactivating the core but not shell attenuated this effect. These data  highlight an important role for the core in cue-induced ethanol-seeking, and suggest that the shell is required to mediate the influence of contexts on conditioned ethanol-seeking.", "19463707": "Accumulating evidence suggests that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are involved in both cocaine reinforcement and the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior. In the present experiments, rats were trained to self-administer cocaine under fixed ratio (for cocaine priming-induced reinstatement) or second-order (for cocaine cue-induced reinstatement) schedules of reinforcement.  Lever pressing was then extinguished followed by a reinstatement phase where operant responding was promoted by either cocaine itself or cocaine-associated light cues. Results indicated that systemic administration of the mGluR5 antagonists 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP: 1 and 3mg/kg i.p.) or 3-((2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)pyridine (MTEP: 0.1 and 1mg/kg i.p.) dose-dependently attenuated reinstatement of drug seeking induced by a systemic priming injection of 10mg/kg cocaine. Systemic administration of MTEP (0.1 and 1mg/kg i.p.) also dose-dependently attenuated cocaine cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. Systemic administration of neither MPEP nor MTEP influenced the  reinstatement of sucrose seeking, which indicates that the effects of these compounds on cocaine seeking were reinforcer specific. Additionally, administration of MPEP (1microg/0.5microl) into the nucleus accumbens shell, a brain region that plays a critical role in cocaine seeking, attenuated cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. These results add to a growing literature indicating that mGluR antagonists attenuate the reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Importantly, the current findings also suggest that activation of mGluR5s specifically in the nucleus accumbens shell may promote the reinstatement of cocaine seeking.", "19380710": "Extinction is a form of inhibitory learning that suppresses a previously conditioned response. Both fear and drug seeking are conditioned responses that can lead to maladaptive behavior when expressed inappropriately, manifesting as anxiety disorders and addiction, respectively. Recent evidence indicates that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is critical for the extinction of both fear and drug-seeking behaviors. Moreover, a dorsal-ventral distinction is apparent within the mPFC, such that the prelimbic (PL-mPFC) cortex drives the expression of fear  and drug seeking, whereas the infralimbic (IL-mPFC) cortex suppresses these behaviors after extinction. For conditioned fear, the dorsal-ventral dichotomy is accomplished via divergent projections to different subregions of the amygdala, whereas for drug seeking, it is accomplished via divergent projections to the subregions of the nucleus accumbens. Given that the mPFC represents a common node in the extinction circuit for these behaviors, treatments that target this region may help alleviate symptoms of both anxiety and addictive disorders by enhancing  extinction memory.", "19357347": "Stress hormones released in the CNS following exposure to unavoidable, aversive stimuli have been shown to alter the physiology of neurons in multiple brain regions including hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and ventral tegmental area. The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a motor-limbic interface linked to motivation  and reward, receives inputs from each of these stress-affected brain regions, raising the possibility that its function might also be altered in response to stress. To assess potential stress-induced plasticity in the NAc, we exposed adult mice to daily cold water forced swim for 2 consecutive days and conducted electrophysiological experiments assessing glutamate receptor function in brain slices taken 18-24 h following the second swim. We found that AMPA receptor (AMPAR)/N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) ratios, a measure of synaptic strength, were increased in the NAc shell but not core medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in stressed animals relative to controls. This effect was blocked by preadministration of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU486, suggesting that the observed changes are dependent on corticosteroid signaling. The role of  corticosterone (CORT) in the observed plasticity was confirmed, because exogenous administration of 10 mg/kg CORT also enhanced AMPAR/NMDAR ratios in the NAc shell. The synaptic changes in NAc shell MSNs reflect an enhancement of AMPAR-mediated currents, as we observed increased AMPAR miniature postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude following stress but no change in NMDAR mEPSCs. We hypothesize that altered information processing via plasticity of excitatory inputs might contribute to reward-related behaviors such as stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking in animals and relapse in humans.", "19261883": "Chronic cocaine treatment is associated with changes in dendritic spines in the nucleus accumbens, but it is unknown whether this neuroplasticity alters the effect of a subsequent cocaine injection on spine morphology and protein content. Three weeks after daily cocaine or saline administration, neurons in the accumbens were filled with the lipophilic dye, DiI. Although daily cocaine pretreatment did not alter spine density compared with daily saline, there was a  shift from smaller to larger diameter spines. During the first 2 h after an acute cocaine challenge, a bidirectional change in spine head diameter and increase in  spine density was measured in daily cocaine-pretreated animals. In contrast, no change in spine diameter or density was elicited by a cocaine challenge in daily  saline animals during the first 2 h after injection. However, spine density was elevated at 6 h after a cocaine challenge in daily saline-pretreated animals. The time-dependent profile of proteins in the postsynaptic density subfraction elicited by a cocaine challenge in daily cocaine-pretreated subjects indicated that the changes in spine diameter and density were associated with a deteriorating actin cytoskeleton and a reduction in glutamate signaling-related proteins. Correspondingly, the amplitude of field potentials in accumbens evoked  by stimulating prefrontal cortex was reduced for up to 6 h after acute cocaine in daily cocaine-withdrawn animals. These data indicate that daily cocaine pretreatment dysregulates dendritic spine plasticity elicited by a subsequent cocaine injection.", "18930184": "BACKGROUND: If presentation of a stimulus (conditional stimulus, CS) reliably predicts delivery of a reward, the CS will come to evoke a conditional response (CR) through Pavlovian learning, and the CS may also acquire incentive motivational properties. Thus, CSs can have both predictive and incentive properties. We ask here whether it is possible to dissociate the predictive versus incentive properties of a CS in rats by considering individual differences in the nature of the CR. METHODS: We used Pavlovian procedures to study the ability of a localizable CS (an illuminated lever) to acquire two properties of an incentive stimulus-the ability to attract and the ability to act as a conditional reinforcer. RESULTS: For some rats, the CS evoked a \"sign-tracking\" CR, consisting of approach toward and engagement with the CS itself. For other rats, the CS instead produced a \"goal-tracking\" CR: approach was directed away from the CS toward the  site of food delivery. For sign-trackers (but not goal-trackers) the CS also acted as an effective conditional reinforcer. CONCLUSIONS: The predictive and incentive properties of a CS can be dissociated by considering individual differences in the CR. In a given animal, a cue that is predictive of reward, supporting Pavlovian learning, may or may not be attributed with incentive salience. This procedure may provide a powerful means to test hypotheses regarding the role of neural systems in learning versus incentive motivational functions and to study individual variation in the extent to which reward-associated stimuli act as incentive stimuli.", "18855805": "Impulsive behaviors are closely linked to drug use and abuse, both as contributors to use and as consequences of use. Trait impulsivity is an important determinant of drug use during development, and in adults momentary 'state' increases in impulsive behavior may increase the likelihood of drug use, especially in individuals attempting to abstain. Conversely, acute and chronic effects of drug use may increase impulsive behaviors, which may in turn facilitate further drug use. However, these effects depend on the behavioral measure used to assess impulsivity. This article reviews data from controlled studies investigating different measures of impulsive behaviors, including delay  discounting, behavioral inhibition and a newly proposed measure of inattention. Our findings support the hypothesis that drugs of abuse alter performance across  independent behavioral measures of impulsivity. The findings lay the groundwork for studying the cognitive and neurobiological substrates of impulsivity, and for future studies on the role of impulsive behavior as both facilitator and a result of drug use.", "18760698": "Repeated exposure to cocaine causes sensitized behavioral responses and increased dendritic spines on medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We find  that cocaine regulates myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors to  control these two processes in vivo. Cocaine suppresses striatal MEF2 activity in part through a mechanism involving cAMP, the regulator of calmodulin signaling (RCS), and calcineurin. We show that reducing MEF2 activity in the NAc in vivo is required for the cocaine-induced increases in dendritic spine density. Surprisingly, we find that increasing MEF2 activity in the NAc, which blocks the  cocaine-induced increase in dendritic spine density, enhances sensitized behavioral responses to cocaine. Together, our findings implicate MEF2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine and suggest that reducing MEF2 activity (and increasing spine density) in NAc may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long-lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine.", "18640922": "In humans, exposure to environmental contexts previously associated with drug intake often provokes relapse to drug use, but the mechanisms mediating this relapse are unknown. Based on early studies by Bouton & Bolles on context-induced 'renewal' of learned behaviours, we developed a procedure to study context-induced relapse to drug seeking. In this procedure, rats are first trained to self-administer drug in one context. Next, drug-reinforced lever responding is extinguished in a different (non-drug) context. Subsequently, context-induced reinstatement of drug seeking is assessed by re-exposing rats to  the drug-associated context. Using variations of this procedure, we and others reported reliable context-induced reinstatement in rats with a history of heroin, cocaine, heroin-cocaine combination, alcohol and nicotine self-administration. Here, we first discuss potential psychological mechanisms of context-induced reinstatement, including excitatory and inhibitory Pavlovian conditioning, and occasion setting. We then summarize results from pharmacological and neuroanatomical studies on the role of several neurotransmitter systems (dopamine, glutamate, serotonin and opioids) and brain areas (ventral tegmental area, accumbens shell, dorsal striatum, basolateral amygdala, prefrontal cortex,  dorsal hippocampus and lateral hypothalamus) in context-induced reinstatement. We conclude by discussing the clinical implications of rat studies on context-induced reinstatement of drug seeking.", "18486119": "Glutamate signaling in the nucleus accumbens influences reinstatement of previously extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior in rats. Whether or not region specific glutamate signaling in the nucleus accumbens contributes to reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior is not known. We investigated whether directly stimulating ionotropic glutamate receptors (GluRs) within the nucleus accumbens core or shell would differentially influence renewed cocaine-seeking behavior following extinction training. We also tested the hypothesis that GluR1  subunit (GluR1) containing alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (AMPA) receptors in the nucleus accumbens core and not the shell regulate reinstatement of previously extinguished cocaine-seeking behavior. Microinjection of AMPA into the nucleus accumbens shell and the nucleus accumbens core dose-dependently elicited significant cocaine-seeking behavior. Administration of antisense oligonucleotides (AS) directed against GluR1 subunit mRNA into the core and shell disrupted AMPA- and cocaine-primed reinstatement--with the most pronounced effects seen in the nucleus accumbens shell. These results demonstrate that GluRs in the nucleus accumbens core and shell influence AMPA- and cocaine-primed reinstatement, yet the nucleus accumbens shell exerts a prepotency over the nucleus accumbens core.", "18354020": "Long-term changes in glutamate transmission in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) contribute to the reinstatement of drug seeking after extinction of cocaine self-administration. Whether similar adaptations in glutamate transmission occur during heroin and cue-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking  is unknown. After 2 weeks of heroin self-administration and 2 weeks of subsequent extinction training, heroin seeking was induced by a noncontingent injection of heroin or by presentation of light/tone cues previously paired with heroin infusions. Microdialysis was conducted in the NAcore during reinstatement of heroin seeking in animals extinguished from heroin self-administration or in subjects receiving parallel (yoked) noncontingent saline or heroin. Reinstatement by either heroin or cue increased extracellular glutamate in the NAcore in the self-administration group, but no increase was elicited during heroin-induced reinstatement in the yoked control groups. The increase in glutamate during heroin-induced drug seeking was abolished by inhibiting synaptic transmission in  the NAcore with tetrodotoxin or by inhibiting glutamatergic afferents to the NAcore from the prelimbic cortex. Supporting critical involvement of glutamate release, heroin seeking induced by cue or heroin was blocked by inhibiting AMPA/kainate glutamate receptors in the NAcore. Interestingly, although a heroin-priming injection increased dopamine equally in animals trained to self-administer heroin and in yoked-saline subjects, inhibition of dopamine receptors in the NAcore also blocked heroin- and cue-induced drug seeking. Together, these findings show that recruitment of the glutamatergic projection from the prelimbic cortex to NAcore is necessary to initiate the reinstatement of heroin seeking.", "18345022": "The main characteristics of cocaine addiction are compulsive drug use despite adverse consequences and high rates of relapse during periods of abstinence. A current popular hypothesis is that compulsive cocaine use and cocaine relapse is  due to drug-induced neuroadaptations in reward-related learning and memory processes, which cause hypersensitivity to cocaine-associated cues, impulsive decision making and abnormal habit-like learned behaviours that are insensitive to adverse consequences. Here, we review results from studies on the effect of cocaine exposure on selected signalling cascades, growth factors and physiological processes previously implicated in neuroplasticity underlying normal learning and memory. These include the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathway, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glutamate transmission, and synaptic plasticity (primarily in the form of long-term potentiation and depression, LTP and LTD). We also discuss the degree to which these cocaine-induced neuroplasticity changes in the mesolimbic dopamine system mediate cocaine psychomotor sensitization and cocaine-seeking behaviours,  as assessed in animal models of drug addiction. Finally, we speculate on how these factors may interact to initiate and sustain cocaine psychomotor sensitization and cocaine seeking.", "18003845": "In humans, exposure to environmental contexts previously associated with heroin intake can provoke drug relapse, but the neuronal mechanisms mediating this relapse are unknown. Using a drug relapse model, we found previously that reexposing rats to heroin-associated contexts, after extinction of drug-reinforced responding in different contexts, reinstates heroin seeking. This effect is attenuated by inhibition of glutamate transmission in the ventral tegmental area and medial accumbens shell, components of the mesolimbic dopamine  system. Here, we explored the role of dopamine of the accumbens in context-induced reinstatement by using the D1-family receptor antagonist SCH 23390 [R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride]. Rats were trained to self-administer heroin for 12 d; drug infusions were paired with a discrete tone-light cue. Subsequently, the heroin-reinforced lever pressing was extinguished in the presence of the discrete cue in a context that differed from the drug self-administration context in terms of visual, auditory, tactile, and circadian cues. When tested in the original drug self-administration context, systemic and medial or lateral accumbens shell  SCH 23390 injections attenuated context-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking,  whereas accumbens core SCH 23390 injections were ineffective. In contrast, core but not lateral or medial shell SCH 23390 injections attenuated discrete-cue-induced reinstatement in a nondrug context after extinction of lever presses without this cue. Results indicate that activation of medial and lateral  accumbens shell D1-family dopamine receptors mediate context-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking and provide the first demonstration for a role of lateral shell dopamine in conditioned drug effects. Results also demonstrate novel dissociable roles of accumbens core and shell in context- versus discrete-cue-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking.", "17986709": "Using data from 1,162 people entering treatment and followed up (> 94%) for 8 years, this article examines the relationship between the duration of abstinence  (1 month to 5 or more years) and other aspects of recovery (e.g., health, mental  health, coping responses, legal involvement, vocational involvement, housing, peers, social and spiritual support), including the trend and at what point changes occur. It also examines how the duration of abstinence at a given point is related to the odds of sustaining abstinence in the subsequent year. The findings demonstrate the rich patterns of change associated with the course of long-term recovery.", "17678505": "Conditioned place preference (CPP) continues to be one of the most popular models to study the motivational effects of drugs and non-drug treatments in experimental animals. This is obvious from a steady year-to-year increase in the  number of publications reporting the use this model. Since the compilation of the preceding review in 1998, more than 1000 new studies using place conditioning have been published, and the aim of the present review is to provide an overview  of these recent publications. There are a number of trends and developments that  are obvious in the literature of the last decade. First, as more and more knockout and transgenic animals become available, place conditioning is increasingly used to assess the motivational effects of drugs or non-drug rewards in genetically modified animals. Second, there is a still small but growing literature on the use of place conditioning to study the motivational aspects of  pain, a field of pre-clinical research that has so far received little attention, because of the lack of appropriate animal models. Third, place conditioning continues to be widely used to study tolerance and sensitization to the rewarding effects of drugs induced by pre-treatment regimens. Fourth, extinction/reinstatement procedures in place conditioning are becoming increasingly popular. This interesting approach is thought to model certain aspects of relapse to addictive behavior and has previously almost exclusively been studied in drug self-administration paradigms. It has now also become established in the place conditioning literature and provides an additional and technically easy approach to this important phenomenon. The enormous number of studies to be covered in this review prevented in-depth discussion of many methodological, pharmacological or neurobiological aspects; to a large extent, the presentation of data had to be limited to a short and condensed summary of the most relevant findings.", "17019567": "BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: The reinstatement model is widely used to study relapse to drug addiction. However, the model's validity is open to question. OBJECTIVE: We assess the reinstatement model in terms of criterion and construct  validity. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We find that the reinstatement model has adequate criterion validity in the broad sense of the term, as evidenced by the fact that reinstatement in laboratory animals is induced by conditions reported to provoke relapse in humans. The model's criterion validity in the narrower sense, as a medication screen, seems promising for relapse to heroin, nicotine, and alcohol. For relapse to cocaine, criterion validity has not yet been established primarily because clinical studies have examined medication's effects on reductions in cocaine intake rather than relapse during abstinence. The model's construct validity faces more substantial challenges and is yet to be established, but we argue that some of the criticisms of the model in this regard may have been overstated.", "16703399": "RATIONALE: Group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2/3) agonists are proposed to serve as potential treatment for addiction. OBJECTIVES: The present study examined the hypothesis that mGluR2/3 agonists exert inhibitory effects on cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking. METHODS: Rats were trained to self-administer either cocaine or control reinforcer (food), then responding on the reinforcer-paired lever was extinguished. Reinstatement of responding was induced by a noncontingent presentation of the self-administered reinforcer (10 mg/kg cocaine, i.p. or 765 mg of food). In one experiment, rats were systemically pretreated with vehicle (Veh) or the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 (0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before the reinstatement test session. In a second experiment, Veh or LY379268 (0.05, 0.5, or 5 nmol/side) was microinjected into the nucleus accumbens core (NAc core) 5 min before the reinstatement test session. The effects of LY379268 on cocaine-  and food-induced reinstatement on reward seeking were assessed. RESULTS: Both systemic and intra-NAc core pretreatment with LY379268 inhibited both cocaine- and food-seeking behavior. However, the effect of LY379268 appeared somewhat more effective for cocaine-seeking than food-seeking. CONCLUSIONS: These results support a potential therapeutic role for mGluR2/3 agonists on relapse of cocaine-seeking. However, doses that inhibited cocaine-seeking were only threefold lower than those inhibiting food-seeking, indicating possible unacceptable nonspecific effects. In addition, the NAc core is one site of action where the mGluR2/3 agonists elicit effects on reward-seeking behavior.", "16552556": "RATIONALE: The transition from stable to escalated drug intake has been demonstrated in rats self-administrating cocaine and heroin using a single dose of drug. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prolonged exposure to methamphetamine self-administration and the effect of various training doses of methamphetamine on the changes of methamphetamine intake over a 21-day period. METHODS: Two groups of rats were trained in 1-h daily sessions of methamphetamine self-administration [0.033 mg/infusion (inf); approximately 0.066 mg/kg/inf]. Methamphetamine access was increased to 6 h in one group [Long Access (LgA)] or maintained at 1 h in another [Short Access (ShA)]. The same procedure was repeated in rats exposed to different training doses of methamphetamine (0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/kg/inf). RESULTS: In LgA rats, total and first hour intake of methamphetamine significantly increased compared to ShA rats at various methamphetamine doses. LgA animals, at all doses in the second study, escalated intake to 8-9 mg/kg per  6-h session, with the most rapid escalation occurring at 3-5 days at a methamphetamine dose of 0.1 mg/kg/inf. CONCLUSIONS: The escalation of drug intake observed with extended access is produced at multiple doses of methamphetamine. The rapidity of escalation depends on the dose. Ultimately, all doses in the dose-response study engendered self-administration of the same amount of total drug in a 6-h session in the extended-access group. Results suggest that the rapidity of escalation is dependent on dose and has an upper limit of intake over a period of 21 days.", "16367789": "Cholinergic interneurons of the striatum respond to motivationally relevant stimuli and are involved in appetitive learning. However, there has been relatively little inquiry into the role of striatal acetylcholine in food motivation. Here we show in rats that a single infusion of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine (0, 5.0 or 10.0 microg/0.5 microL bilaterally) potently reduced 24-h food intake following injections into either the ventral or dorsal striatum, without affecting water intake. Furthermore, muscarinic receptor blockade induced reliable and widespread reductions in striatal preproenkephalin, but not preprodynorphin, mRNA expression. These data suggest a novel role for striatal acetylcholine in modulating feeding behavior via its effects on enkephalin gene expression. As prior research indicates a critical role for striatal enkephalin in consummatory behaviors and palatability, we hypothesize that cholinergic interneurons assist in translating hypothalamic energy state signals into food-directed behaviors via their regulation of striatal opioid peptides.", "16341024": "Using a rat relapse model, we previously reported that re-exposing rats to a drug-associated context, following extinction of operant responding in a different context, reinstates heroin seeking. In an initial pharmacological characterization, we found that the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268, which acts centrally to reduce evoked glutamate release, attenuates context-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking when injected systemically or into the ventral tegmental area, the cell body region of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Here, we  tested whether injections of LY379268 into the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a terminal region of the mesolimbic dopamine system, would also attenuate context-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. Rats were trained to self-administer heroin; drug infusions were paired with a discrete tone-light cue. Subsequently, lever pressing was extinguished in the presence of the discrete cue in a context that differed from the drug self-administration context in terms of visual, auditory, tactile, and circadian cues. After extinction of responding, LY379268 was injected to different groups of rats into the NAc core or shell or into the caudate-putamen, a terminal region of the nigrastriatal dopamine system. Injections of LY379268 into the NAc shell (0.3 or 1.0 microg) dose-dependently attenuated context-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. Injections of 1.0 microg of LY379268 into the NAc core had no effect, while a higher dose (3.0 microg) decreased this reinstatement. Injections of LY379268 (3.0 microg) 1.5 mm dorsal from the NAc core into the caudate-putamen were ineffective. Results suggest an important role of glutamate transmission in the NAc shell in context-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking.", "16233956": "(1R,2R,3R,5R,6R)-2-Amino-3-(3,4-dichlorobenzyloxy)-6-fluorobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2 ,6-dicarboxylic acid (MGS0039), a potent and selective metabotropic glutamate 2/3 (mGlu 2/3) receptor antagonist, exhibits antidepressant-like activities in some animal models. In the present study, we examined the effect of MGS0039 on extracellular dopamine levels in the rat nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell using in vivo microdialysis evaluation because accumbal dopamine has been implicated in depression. Local application of MGS0039 into the NAc shell at 10 microM significantly increased extracellular dopamine levels in the NAc shell in freely  moving rats. In contrast, local application of 10 microM of LY354740, an mGlu 2/3 receptor agonist, significantly decreased extracellular dopamine levels in the same brain region. These findings suggest that dopamine release in the NAc shell  is regulated by mGlu 2/3 receptors, and that the effect on dopamine levels in the NAc shell may partially explain the antidepressant-like properties of mGlu 2/3 receptor antagonists.", "16205775": "Enhanced dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens plays an important role in cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. However, the contribution of each dopamine receptor subtype to this behavior remains unclear.  The present experiments were designed to assess the role of D2-like dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens core and shell subregions in cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. Rats were trained to lever press for cocaine using a fixed ratio (FR) 5 schedule of reinforcement. After approximately 18 days of cocaine self-administration, the animals underwent an extinction phase during which cocaine was replaced with saline. Daily extinction  sessions were conducted until responding was less than 10% of the response rate maintained by cocaine self-administration. Following the extinction phase, priming-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior was assessed. A range of doses of antagonists selective for D2- (sulpiride, 0.2 or 2.0 microg), D3- (U99194A, 3.9 or 7.8 microg), or D4- (L-750,667, 5.5 or 11 microg) dopamine receptors were microinjected into either the nucleus accumbens core, shell or lateral septum prior to a priming injection of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Following administration into the shell, but not core or lateral septum, sulpiride dose-dependently attenuated reinstatement induced by a cocaine priming  injection. In contrast, U99194A and L-750,667 failed to influence cocaine seeking at any of the doses tested in either accumbal subregion. Collectively, these findings indicate that activation of D2 dopamine receptors mediates cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking in a region-specific manner within the nucleus accumbens.", "16034441": "Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse results in an increased sensitivity to their  behavioral effects, a phenomena referred to as behavioral sensitization. It has been suggested that the same neuroadaptations underlying behavioral sensitization contribute to the maintenance and reinstatement of addiction. Dysregulation of dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the mesoaccumbens system is one neuroadaptation that is thought to lead to the compulsive drug-seeking that characterizes addiction. Evidence that sensitization to psychostimulants and opiates is associated with an enhancement of drug-evoked DA levels in the nucleus accumbens has also been obtained. Like other drugs of abuse, the acute administration of ethanol (ETOH) stimulates DA release in this brain region. Moreover, repeated ETOH experience results in an enhanced behavioral response to  a subsequent ethanol challenge. Data regarding the influence of repeated ethanol  intoxication and withdrawal upon mesoaccumbal DA neurotransmission is limited. Studies examining ETOH-evoked alterations in mesoaccumbal DA neurotransmission as a function of withdrawal duration are lacking. The present experiments quantified basal and ethanol-evoked DA levels 14 days and 24 h following the cessation of a  repeated ETOH intoxication protocol, which results in sensitization to the locomotor activating effects of ethanol. Locomotor activity was assessed in parallel groups of animals. Studies were conducted in two mouse strains, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, which differ in their behavioral responses to ETOH. The results indicate the development of transient tolerance to both ETOH-induced behavioral activation and evoked accumbens DA release at early withdrawal. Moreover, no enhanced DA response to a subsequent ETOH challenge could be demonstrated in ETOH experienced animals 2 weeks after withdrawal, in spite of the observation of clear behavioral sensitization at this time point. These results suggest that, at least in the case of ethanol, sensitization of the DA mesolimbic system may not be necessary for the development of behavioral sensitization.", "15931079": "In humans, drug-associated stimuli can provoke heroin relapse during abstinence.  In rats, cues paired with heroin self-administration reinstate heroin seeking in  a relapse model. The neurobiological mechanisms involved in this reinstatement, however, are largely unknown. Here, we determined the effect of LY379268, an mGluR2/3 agonist that decreases evoked glutamate release, on cue-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. Systemic injections of LY379268 attenuated reinstatement of heroin seeking induced by exposure to a discrete tone-light cue  that was previously paired with heroin infusions during self-administration training. In contrast, LY379268 had no effect on heroin self-administration. Results indicate that glutamate plays an important role in cue-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking and suggest that mGluR2/3 agonists should be considered for the treatment of opiate relapse.", "15564590": "The environmental context previously associated with opiate use plays an important role in human relapse, but the neuronal mechanisms involved in context-induced drug relapse are not known. Using a rat relapse model, we determined the effect of a group II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist [LY379268 ((-)-2-oxa-4-aminobicylco hexane-4,6-dicarboxylic acid)] on contextual  cue-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking. LY379268, which acts centrally to reduce evoked glutamate release, was injected systemically or directly into the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a brain area involved in opiate reward and conditioned drug effects. Rats were trained to self-administer intravenous heroin for 12 d; drug infusions were paired with a discrete tone-light cue. Subsequently, lever pressing was extinguished in the presence of the discrete cue in a context that differed from the drug self-administration context in terms of  visual, auditory, tactile, and circadian cues. After extinction of lever responding, LY379268 was injected systemically or into the VTA, and nonreinforced responding was determined in the extinction context or the drug context. Exposure to the heroin-associated context induced robust reinstatement of drug seeking, and this effect was attenuated by systemic or intra-VTA injections of LY379268. Results indicate that glutamate transmission in the VTA plays an important role in contextual cue-induced relapse to heroin seeking.", "15331648": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is an important forebrain area involved in sensitization, withdrawal effects, and self-administration of cocaine. However, little is known about cocaine-induced alterations in the neuronal excitability and whole cell neuroplasticity in this region that may affect behaviors. Our recent investigations have demonstrated that repeated cocaine administration decreases voltage-sensitive sodium and calcium currents (VSSCs and VSCCs, respectively) in freshly dissociated NAc neurons of rats. In this study, current-clamp recordings were performed in slice preparations to determine the effects of chronic cocaine on evoked Ca(2+) potentials and voltage-sensitive K(+) currents in NAc neurons. Repeated cocaine administration with 3-4 days of withdrawal caused significant alterations in Ca(2+) potentials, including suppression of Ca(2+)-mediated spikes, increase in the intracellular injected current intensity required for generation of Ca(2+) potentials (rheobase), reduced duration of Ca(2+) plateau potentials, and abolishment of secondary Ca(2+) potentials associated with the primary Ca(2+) plateau potential. Application of nickel (Ni(2+)), which blocks low-voltage activated T-type Ca(2+)  channels, had no impact on evoked Ca(2+) plateau potentials in NAc neurons, indicating that these Ca(2+) potentials are high-voltage activated (HVA). In addition, repeated cocaine pretreatment also hyperpolarized the resting membrane  potential, increased the amplitude of afterhyperpolarization in Ca(2+) spikes, and enhanced the outward rectification observed during membrane depolarization. These findings indicate that repeated cocaine administration not only suppressed  HVA-Ca(2+) potentials but also significantly enhanced the activity of various K(+) channels in NAc neurons. They also demonstrate an integrative role of whole  cell neuroplasticity during cocaine withdrawal, by which the subthreshold membrane excitability of NAc neurons is significantly decreased.", "15310907": "Compulsive drug use in the face of adverse consequences is a hallmark feature of  addiction, yet there is little preclinical evidence demonstrating the actual progression from casual to compulsive drug use. Presentation of an aversive conditioned stimulus suppressed drug seeking in rats with limited cocaine self-administration experience, but no longer did so after an extended cocaine-taking history. In contrast, after equivalent extended sucrose experience, sucrose seeking was still suppressed by an aversive conditioned stimulus. Persistent cocaine seeking in the presence of signals of environmental  adversity after a prolonged cocaine-taking history was not due to impaired fear conditioning, nor to an increase in the incentive value of cocaine, and may reflect the establishment of compulsive behavior.", "15306650": "An insidious feature of drug craving and drug seeking in humans is that it can be induced and maintained by conditioned stimuli after a prolonged drug-free period. Understanding the neural basis of this control over addictive behavior may aid in the development of treatments targeting drug seeking and thereby be beneficial in preventing drug use. In the present study, we used a well established animal model to investigate the functional importance of amygdala-nucleus accumbens interactions in cocaine seeking under the control of drug-associated conditioned  reinforcers. To probe the direct neuroanatomical relationship between these structures within a functional corticostriatal loop, we used a neuropharmacological disconnection procedure. Thus, infusing a dopamine receptor  antagonist unilaterally into the basolateral amygdala (which had no effect on its own) and an AMPA-kainate (KA) receptor antagonist into the contralateral nucleus  accumbens core (which also had no effect on its own) greatly reduced cocaine seeking. We also show that bilateral infusions of the DA receptor antagonist into the amygdala, but not nucleus accumbens, or of the AMPA-KA receptor antagonist in the nucleus accumbens, but not the amygdala, also greatly reduced cocaine seeking. The results of this study demonstrate an amygdala-nucleus accumbens system that critically underlies stimulus-controlled cocaine seeking and indicate possible neurochemical targets for relapse-prevention medication.", "14973230": "The role of limbic, cortical, and striatal circuitry in a footshock reinstatement model of relapse to cocaine seeking was evaluated. Transient inhibition of the central extended amygdala [CEA; including the central nucleus of the amygdala (CN), ventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTv), and nucleus accumbens  shell (NAshell)], ventral tegmental area (VTA), and motor circuitry [including the dorsal prefrontal cortex (PFCd), nucleus accumbens core (NAcore), and ventral pallidum (VP)] blocked the ability of footshock stress to reinstate lever pressing previously associated with cocaine delivery. However, inhibition of the  basolateral amygdala, mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, or the ventral prefrontal cortex had no effect on drug-seeking behavior. These data suggest that footshock stress activates limbic circuitry of the CEA that, via the VTA, activates motor output circuitry responsible for producing lever press responding. Consistent with this notion, the D1/D2 dopamine receptor antagonist fluphenazine blocked footshock-induced reinstatement when infused into the PFCd.  Further, inhibition of the NAshell blocked a footshock-induced increase in dopamine within the PFC and concomitantly blocked reinstatement responding. Also  supporting the idea of a CEA-VTA-motor circuit in stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking, inactivation of the PFCd was shown to block stress-induced glutamate release within the NAcore while concurrently inhibiting reinstatement responding. Taken together, these data suggest that footshock activates limbic circuitry in the CEA, which in turn activates a VTA dopamine projection to the PFCd. The rise in dopamine within the PFCd initiates reinstatement via a glutamatergic projection to the NAcore.", "14762122": "Dopaminergic transmission in the nucleus accumbens has been proposed to modulate  the effects of converging excitatory inputs from the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Here, we used in vivo intracellular recording in anesthetized rats to examine the response of nucleus accumbens neurons to stimulation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The EPSP elicited in accumbens neurons by PFC stimulation was attenuated by VTA train stimulation in a pattern mimicking dopamine cell burst firing. PFC-elicited EPSPs were smaller in amplitude and faster to decay after VTA stimulation. These changes could not be explained by membrane depolarization alone, because EPSPs evoked during the sustained depolarization after VTA stimulation were significantly smaller than EPSPs evoked during spontaneously occurring up states. Furthermore,  no attenuation of PFC-elicited responses was observed during depolarization produced by positive current injection through the recording electrode. Administration of a D1 antagonist (SCH 23390; 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effect on the VTA reduction of PFC-elicited responses, whereas administration of a D2 antagonist (eticlopride; 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed the reduction of PFC inputs when the analysis was limited to comparisons with spontaneous up states. These results suggest that the ability of PFC inputs to drive accumbens neurons is dampened by dopamine acting primarily at D2 receptors. Along with previous reports of dopaminergic attenuation of limbic afferents to the accumbens, these findings support the hypothesis that dopamine mediates the selection and integration of excitatory inputs and thus shapes information processing in accumbens output neurons.", "14729134": "The basal ganglia and frontal cortex operate together to execute goal directed behaviors. This requires not only the execution of motor plans, but also the behaviors that lead to this execution, including emotions and motivation that drive behaviors, cognition that organizes and plans the general strategy, motor planning, and finally, the execution of that plan. The components of the frontal  cortex that mediate these behaviors, are reflected in the organization, physiology, and connections between areas of frontal cortex and in their projections through basal ganglia circuits. This comprises a series of parallel pathways. However, this model does not address how information flows between circuits thereby developing new learned behaviors (or actions) from a combination of inputs from emotional, cognitive, and motor cortical areas. Recent anatomical  evidence from primates demonstrates that the neuro-networks within basal ganglia  pathways are in a position to move information across functional circuits. Two networks are: the striato-nigral-striatal network and the thalamo-cortical-thalamic network. Within each of these sets of connected structures, there are both reciprocal connections linking up regions associated with similar functions and non-reciprocal connections linking up regions that are associated with different cortical basal ganglia circuits. Each component of information (from limbic to motor outcome) sends both feedback connection, and also a feedforward connection, allowing the transfer of information. Information  is channeled from limbic, to cognitive, to motor circuits. Action decision-making processes are thus influenced by motivation and cognitive inputs, allowing the animal to respond appropriate to environmental cues.", "13714876": "Four rats were trained to press a lever on a ratio schedule of reinforcement in which the number of lever presses required on each consecutive run increased by a fixed increment. Both concentration and volume of the reward were varied. Relationships were obtained between reward and deprivation variables and the size of the final completed ratio run.", "12965226": "Striatal cholinergic interneurons located in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens are amenable to influences of the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, which is a pathway involved in reward and reinforcement and targeted by several drugs of abuse. Dopamine and acetylcholine neurotransmission and their interactions are essential to striatal function, and disruptions to these systems lead to a variety of clinical disorders. Dopamine regulates acetylcholine release through dopamine receptors that are localized directly on striatal cholinergic interneurons. The dopamine D2 receptor, which attenuates acetylcholine release, has been implicated in drug relapse and is targeted by therapeutic drugs that are used to treat a variety of neurological disorders including Tourette Syndrome, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. The present study provides the first direct evidence for the localization of dopamine D2 receptors on striatal cholinergic interneurons of the rat brain using dual labeling immunocytochemistry procedures. Using light microscopy, dopamine D2 receptors were localized on the cell somata and dendritic and axonal processes of striatal cholinergic interneurons in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens of the rat brain. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the specific roles that cholinergic neuronal network systems and interacting dopaminergic signaling pathways play in striatal function and in a variety of clinical disorders including drug abuse and addiction.", "12927219": "The nucleus accumbens, a major component of the ventral striatum, and the dorsal  striatum are primary targets of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, which is a pathway that plays a critical role in reward and addiction. The shell compartment of the nucleus accumbens and the ventromedial striatum, in particular, receive extensive afferent projections from the ventral tegmental area, which is the major afferent source of the mesolimbic pathway [Prog Brain Res 99 (1993) 209; J  Neurosci 7 (1987) 3915]. The present study focused on striatal cholinergic interneurons as potential key neurons involved in the neural basis of drug reinforcement. The main finding of this study is that cholinergic interneurons located in the shell compartment of the nucleus accumbens and the ventromedial striatum were activated, as measured by Fos labeling, following a 1 h session of  the self-administration of cocaine in rats. A direct correlation existed between  the percent of cholinergic interneurons that were activated and the amount of cocaine that was self-administered. The greatest amount of administered cocaine (approximately 10 mg/kg) resulted in the activation of approximately 80% of the cholinergic neurons. No such correlation existed in the group of animals that self-administered saline. In addition, activation was not found in the core compartment of the nucleus accumbens or the dorsolateral striatum, which receive  extensive innervation from the substantia nigra and thus are more closely tied to the motor effects of the drug. In conclusion, cocaine-driven neuronal activation  was specific to the shell compartment of the nucleus accumbens (R(2)=0.9365) and  the ventromedial striatum (R(2)=0.9059). These findings demonstrate that cholinergic interneurons are involved in the initial stage of cocaine intake and  that these neurons are located in areas of the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum that are more closely tied to the rewarding and hedonic effects rather than the motor effects of cocaine intake.", "12778052": "Repeated cocaine treatment and withdrawal produces changes in brain function thought to be involved in relapse to drug use. Withdrawal from repeated cocaine reduced in vivo extracellular glutamate in the nucleus accumbens of rats by decreasing the exchange of extracellular cystine for intracellular glutamate. In  vivo restoration of cystine/glutamate exchange by intracranial perfusion of cystine or systemically administered N-acetylcysteine normalized the levels of glutamate in cocaine-treated subjects. To determine if the reduction in nonvesicular glutamate release is a mediator of relapse, we examined cocaine-primed reinstatement of drug seeking after cocaine self-administration was stopped. Reinstatement was prevented by stimulating cystine/glutamate exchange with N-acetylcysteine and restoring extracellular glutamate. Thus, withdrawal from repeated cocaine increases susceptibility to relapse in part by reducing cystine/glutamate exchange, and restoring exchanger activity prevents cocaine-primed drug seeking.", "12402102": "RATIONAL AND OBJECTIVES: The reinstatement model is currently used in many laboratories to investigate mechanisms underlying relapse to drug seeking. Here,  we review briefly the history of the model and describe the different procedures  that have been used to study the phenomenon of reinstatement of drug seeking. The results from studies using pharmacological and neuroanatomical techniques to determine the neuronal events that mediate reinstatement of heroin, cocaine and alcohol seeking by acute priming injections of drugs, drug-associated cues and environmental stressors are summarized. In addition, several issues are discussed, including (1) the concordance between the neuronal mechanisms involved in drug-induced reinstatement and those involved in drug reward and discrimination, (2) the role of drug withdrawal states and periods in reinstatement of drug seeking, (3) the role of neuronal adaptations induced by exposure to drugs in relapse, and (4) the degree to which the rat reinstatement model provides a suitable preclinical model of relapse to drug taking. CONCLUSIONS: The data derived from studies using the reinstatement model suggest  that the neuronal events that mediate drug-, cue- and stress-induced reinstatement of drug seeking are not identical, that the mechanisms underlying drug-induced reinstatement are to some degree different from those mediating drug discrimination or reward, and that the duration of the withdrawal period following cocaine and heroin self-administration has a profound effect on reinstatement induced by drug cues and stress. Finally, there appears to be a good correspondence between the events that induce reinstatement in laboratory animals and those that provoke relapse in humans.", "12388621": "Basal extracellular glutamate sampled in vivo is present in micromolar concentrations in the extracellular space outside the synaptic cleft, and neither the origin nor the function of this glutamate is known. This report reveals that  blockade of glutamate release from the cystine-glutamate antiporter produced a significant decrease (60%) in extrasynaptic glutamate levels in the rat striatum, whereas blockade of voltage-dependent Na+ and Ca2+ channels produced relatively minimal changes (0-30%). This indicates that the primary origin of in vivo extrasynaptic glutamate in the striatum arises from nonvesicular glutamate release by the cystine-glutamate antiporter. By measuring [35S]cystine uptake, it was shown that similar to vesicular release, the activity of the cystine-glutamate antiporter is negatively regulated by group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR2/3) via a cAMP-dependent protein kinase mechanism. Extracellular glutamate derived from the antiporter was shown to regulate extracellular levels of glutamate and dopamine. Infusion of the mGluR2/3 antagonist (RS)-1-amino-5-phosphonoindan-1-carboxylic acid (APICA) increased extracellular glutamate levels, and previous blockade of the antiporter prevented the APICA-induced rise in extracellular glutamate. This suggests that glutamate released from the antiporter is a source of endogenous tone on mGluR2/3. Blockade of the antiporter also produced an increase in extracellular dopamine that was reversed by infusing the mGluR2/3 agonist (2R,4R)-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxlylate, indicating that antiporter-derived glutamate can modulate dopamine transmission via mGluR2/3 heteroreceptors. These  results suggest that nonvesicular release from the cystine-glutamate antiporter is the primary source of in vivo extracellular glutamate and that this glutamate  can modulate both glutamate and dopamine transmission.", "11895178": "Contextual stimuli associated with drug exposure can modulate various effects of  drugs, but little is known about their role in relapse to drug seeking. Using a renewal procedure, the authors report that drug-associated contextual stimuli play a critical role in relapse to drug-seeking previously maintained by a heroin-cocaine mixture (speedball). Rats were trained to self-administer speedball, after which drug-reinforced behavior was extinguished over 20 days in  the self-administration context or in a different context. On the test day, rats  exposed to the drug-associated context, after extinction in a different context,  reliably renewed drug seeking. The authors suggest that the renewal procedure can be used to study mechanisms underlying relapse to drug seeking elicited by drug-associated contextual stimuli.", "11870259": "The objective of this article is to review data from studies that used a reinstatement model in rats to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying relapse to heroin and cocaine seeking induced by exposure to the self-administered drug (drug priming), conditioned drug cues, and stressors. These factors were reported to contribute to relapse to drug use in humans following prolonged abstinence periods. In the reinstatement model, the ability of acute exposure to drug or nondrug stimuli to reinstate drug seeking is determined following training for drug self-administration and subsequent extinction of the drug-reinforced behavior. We will review studies in which pharmacological agents were injected systemically or intracranially to block (or mimic) reinstatement by drug priming, drug cues, and stressors. We also will review studies in which brain lesions, in  vivo microdialysis and electrochemistry, and gene expression methods were used to map brain sites involved in relapse to drug seeking. Subsequently, we will discuss theoretical issues related to the processes underlying relapse to drugs and address methodological issues in studies on reinstatement of drug seeking. Finally, the implications of the findings from the studies reviewed for addiction theories and treatment will be discussed. The main conclusion of this review is that the neuronal mechanisms involved in relapse to heroin and cocaine seeking induced by drug priming, drug cues, and stressors are to a large degree dissociable. The data reviewed also suggest that the neuronal events mediating drug-induced reinstatement are to some degree dissociable from those mediating drug reinforcement.", "11830186": "Relapse to drug use following abstinence is a significant impediment in the long-term treatment of drug abuse and dependence. Conditioned stimuli are believed to be critically involved in activating drug craving and relapse to compulsive drug-taking behavior. Studies in humans and animal models have recently begun to identify the fundamental neural circuitry that mediates relapse following withdrawal from chronic drug self-administration. The current review summarizes key findings in this area that have converged on the amygdalar complex and regions of the frontal lobe as critical structures in conditioned-cued relapse. It is proposed that the amygdala is a key regulator of discrete stimulus-reinforcer associations, while the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal  cortex are critical regulators of relapse evoked by conditioned stimuli that predict drug availability. This corticolimbic circuitry may form the neural basis of multiple long-term conditioned associations produced by a variety of drugs of  abuse ranging from psychostimulants to opiates. Future studies aimed at discerning the functional roles of these pathways will provide critical direction for the development of treatments for the prevention of relapse.", "11449260": "Author information:  (1)Behavioral Neuroscience Branch, Intramural Research Program, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, 5500 Nathan Shock Drive,  Baltimore, Maryland 21224, USA.", "11385572": "How do drugs of abuse modify neural circuitry and thereby lead to addictive behaviour? As for many forms of experience-dependent plasticity, modifications in glutamatergic synaptic transmission have been suggested to be particularly important. Evidence of such changes in response to in vivo administration of drugs of abuse is lacking, however. Here we show that a single in vivo exposure to cocaine induces long-term potentiation of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole propionic acid)-receptor-mediated currents at excitatory synapses onto dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area. Potentiation is still observed 5 but not 10 days after cocaine exposure and is blocked when an NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor antagonist is administered with cocaine. Furthermore, long-term potentiation at these synapses  is occluded and long-term depression is enhanced by in vivo cocaine exposure. These results show that a prominent form of synaptic plasticity can be elicited by a single in vivo exposure to cocaine and therefore may be involved in the early stages of the development of drug addiction.", "10899176": "Elevated dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens is thought to be a primary mediator of addiction to cocaine. However, repeated exposure to cocaine is associated with the recruitment of glutamate transmission. This poses the possibility that the behaviors characterizing cocaine addiction, such as craving-induced relapse, may not be preferentially mediated by dopamine transmission. An animal model of relapse was used to demonstrate that glutamate,  and not dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens, is a primary mediator of  cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. Reinstatement was produced by a systemic injection of cocaine or by the microinjection of the glutamate receptor agonist AMPA or dopamine into the nucleus accumbens. It was found that microinjection of an AMPA receptor antagonist into the nucleus accumbens blocked reinstatement by all compounds, whereas a dopamine receptor antagonist was effective only in blocking reinstatement by intra-accumbens dopamine administration. These data suggest an important role for nucleus accumbens glutamate and not dopamine transmission in cocaine-induced relapse to drug-seeking behavior.", "10501460": "This study investigated the effect of ionotropic glutamate receptor agonist or antagonist administration into the nucleus accumbens on the maintenance of cocaine self-administration and the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior. The stimulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid or N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors in the nucleus accumbens with either alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid or 1-aminocyclobutane-cis-1,3-dicarboxylic acid, respectively, decreased the number  of cocaine-reinforced responses, suggesting an enhancement in the rewarding properties of cocaine. In contrast, blockade of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid receptors with N-methyl-D-aspartate, or N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors with dizocilpine maleate  or 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid had no selective effect on the maintenance of  cocaine self-administration. Following one week of extinction from the reinforcing cue of the drug-paired lever, both alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid and 1-aminocyclobutane-cis-1,3-dicarboxylic acid treatment in the nucleus accumbens reinstated cocaine-seeking behavior. However, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid treatment increased responding only on the drug-paired lever, while 1-aminocyclobutane-cis-1,3-dicarboxylic acid increased responding on both the drug-paired and non-drug-paired levers. These results suggest that stimulation of glutamate receptors in the nucleus accumbens augments the reinforcing effect of cocaine, yet glutamate transmission is not required to maintain cocaine self-administration. In addition, increased glutamate transmission in the nucleus accumbens may be involved in facilitating the relapse to cocaine-seeking behavior.", "9765157": "Differential access to cocaine self-administration produced two patterns of drug  intake in rats. With 1 hour of access per session, drug intake remained low and stable. In contrast, with 6 hours of access, drug intake gradually escalated over days. After escalation, drug consumption was characterized by an increased early  drug loading and an upward shift in the cocaine dose-response function, suggesting an increase in hedonic set point. After 1 month of abstinence, escalation of cocaine intake was reinstated to a higher level than before. These  findings may provide an animal model for studying the development of excessive drug intake and the basis of addiction.", "9614234": "Interactions between dopamine and glutamate play prominent roles in memory, addiction, and schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence have suggested that the ventral midbrain dopamine neurons that give rise to the major CNS dopaminergic projections may also be glutamatergic. To examine this possibility, we double immunostained ventral midbrain sections from rat and monkey for the dopamine-synthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase and for glutamate; we found that most dopamine neurons immunostained for glutamate, both in rat and monkey. We then used postnatal cell culture to examine individual dopamine neurons. Again, most dopamine neurons immunostained for glutamate; they were also immunoreactive  for phosphate-activated glutaminase, the major source of neurotransmitter glutamate. Inhibition of glutaminase reduced glutamate staining. In single-cell microculture, dopamine neurons gave rise to varicosities immunoreactive for both  tyrosine hydroxylase and glutamate and others immunoreactive mainly for glutamate, which were found near the cell body. At the ultrastructural level, dopamine neurons formed occasional dopaminergic varicosities with symmetric synaptic specializations, but they more commonly formed nondopaminergic varicosities with asymmetric synaptic specializations. Stimulation of individual  dopamine neurons evoked a fast glutamatergic autaptic EPSC that showed presynaptic inhibition caused by concomitant dopamine release. Thus, dopamine neurons may exert rapid synaptic actions via their glutamatergic synapses and slower modulatory actions via their dopaminergic synapses. Together with evidence for glutamate cotransmission in serotonergic raphe neurons and noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons, the present results suggest that glutamatergic cotransmission may be the rule for central monoaminergic neurons.", "9412525": "The nucleus accumbens is a forebrain region that mediates cocaine self-administration and withdrawal effects in animal models of cocaine dependence. Considerable evidence suggests an important role of dopamine D1 receptors in these effects. Using a combination of current-clamp recordings in brain slices and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from freshly dissociated neurons, we found that nucleus accumbens neurons are less excitable in cocaine withdrawn rats because of a novel form of plasticity: reduced whole-cell sodium currents. Three days after discontinuation of repeated cocaine injections, nucleus accumbens neurons recorded in brain slices were less responsive to depolarizing current injections, had higher action potential thresholds, and had  lower spike amplitudes. Freshly dissociated nucleus accumbens neurons from cocaine-pretreated rats exhibited diminished sodium current density and a depolarizing shift in the voltage-dependence of sodium channel activation. These  effects appear to be related to enhanced basal phosphorylation of sodium channels because of increased transmission through the dopamine D1 receptor/cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway. The effects of repeated cocaine administration were not mimicked by repeated injections of the local anesthetic lidocaine and were not observed in neurons within the motor cortex, indicating that they did not result  from local anesthetic actions of cocaine. Because nucleus accumbens neurons are normally recruited to coordinate response patterns of movement and affect, the decreased excitability during cocaine withdrawal may be related to symptoms such  as anergia, anhedonia, and depression.", "9221769": "The release of dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to be critical for mediating natural rewards as well as for the reinforcing actions of  drugs of abuse. DA and amphetamine depress both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the NAc by a presynaptic D1-like DA receptor. However, the mechanisms of depression of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission appear to be different. DA depressed the frequency of spontaneous miniature EPSCs, but the frequency of miniature IPSCs was depressed only when spontaneous release was made dependent on Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, the K+ channel blocker Ba2+ attenuated the effects of DA on evoked IPSPs, but not on EPSPs. Thus, DA appears to depress inhibitory synaptic transmission in the NAc by reducing Ca2+ influx into the presynaptic terminal, but depresses excitatory transmission by a distinct mechanism that is independent of the entry of Ca2+.", "9131252": "In the mid to late 1980s, studies were published that provided the first evidence for the existence of glutamate receptors that are not ligand-gated cation channels but are coupled to effector systems through GTP-binding proteins. Since  those initial reports, tremendous progress has been made in characterizing these  metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), including cloning and characterization of cDNA that encodes a family of eight mGluR subtypes, several of which have multiple splice variants. Also, tremendous progress has been made in developing new highly selective mGluR agonists and antagonists and toward determining the physiologic roles of the mGluRs in mammalian brain. These findings have exciting  implications for drug development and suggest that the mGluRs provide a novel target for development of therepeutic agents that could have a significant impact on neuropharmacology.", "8794935": "Drug self-administration studies have recently employed progressive ratio (PR) schedules to examine psychostimulant and opiate reinforcement.

Session parameters adopted for use in our laboratory and the considerations relevant to them are described. The strengths and weaknesses of the PR schedule are also discussed.", "8730590": "1. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made from nucleus accumbens neurones in slices of rat ventral forebrain. In the presence of picrotoxin (50 microM), the amplitude of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione-sensitive glutamate EPSCs, recorded at holding potentials between -80 and -90 mV, was reversibly reduced by  56 +/- 11% (n = 6) by dopamine (30 microM). The selective dopamine D1 receptor agonists SKF 38393 (10 microM) and SKF 81297A (10 microM), but not the selective  D2 receptor agonist quinpirole (10 microM), also reversibly depressed the EPSC by 36-48%. The depression of the EPSC by dopamine was completely blocked by the D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (1 microM), whereas the D2 antagonist (-)-sulpiride (1 microM) was without effect. 2. EPSCs were reversibly depressed by the dopamine mimetic psychostimulants cocaine (1-20 microM) and amphetamine (10-30 microM) by  40 +/- 16 and 62 +/- 9%, respectively, but only in about half of the cells tested (11/23 and 6/13, respectively). Their actions were completely reversed by SCH 23390 (1 microM), indicating that endogenous dopamine can also depress the EPSC via D1 receptors. 3. No discernable effects of dopamine, SKF 81297A, SKF 38393, quinpirole, cocaine or amphetamine were observed on membrane conductance or holding current (at holding potentials of -80 to -90 mV), suggesting that the depression of the EPSC was solely due to an action on presynaptic D1 receptors. 4. In contrast, agents that elevate intracellular levels of adenosine-3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) (forskolin (1-10 microM), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.1-1 mM), rolipram (10 microM), and dibutyryl cAMP  (0.5-1 mM)) caused a reversible increase in the EPSC amplitude (by 21-150%). Furthermore, in the presence of forskolin (10 microM), the ability of dopamine to depress synaptic transmission was unaffected. 5. Together these data suggest that both exogenous dopamine and dopamine released from intrinsic nerve terminals attenuate glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens by presynaptic D1 receptor activation. The transduction mechanism underlying this effect does not appear to involve the formation of cAMP.", "8627379": "To examine potential neural mechanisms involved in cocaine self-administration, the activity of single neurons in the nucleus accumbens of rats was recorded during intravenous cocaine self-administration. Lever pressing was reinforced according to a fixed-ratio 1 schedule. On a time base comparable to the interinfusion interval, half the neurons exhibited phasic firing patterns time locked to the cocaine reinforced level press. For almost all neurons, this pattern consisted of a change in firing rate postpress, typically a decrease, followed by a reversal of that change. The postpress change was closely related to the lever press. Typically, it began within the first 0.2 min postpress and culminated within the first 1.0 min postpress. For a small portion of responsive  neurons, the reversal of the postpress change was punctate and occurred within 1-3 min of either the last lever press or the next lever press so that firing was stable during much of the interinfusion interval. For the majority of neurons, the reversal was progressive; it began within 2 min after the previous level press, and it was not complete until the last 0.1-2.0 min before the next lever press. The duration of this progressive reversal, but not of the postpress change, was positively correlated with the interinfusion interval. Thus, in addition to exhibiting changes in firing related to the occurrence of self-infusion, the majority of neurons also exhibited progressive changes in firing related to the spacing of infusions. In a structure that has been shown to be necessary for cocaine self-administration, such a firing pattern is a likely neurophysiological component of the mechanism that transduces declining drug levels into increased drug-related appetitive behavior. It is, thus, a neural mechanism that may contribute to compulsive drug-maintained drug taking.", "7895034": "Two subdivisions of the nucleus accumbens (NAC), the core and the shell, have been recently identified on the basis of immunohistochemical differences and neural connections. A major neural input to the NAC is provided by glutamatergic  afferents of allocortical origin and there is evidence that glutamate can modulate psychomotor activation and drug reinforcement. This study was undertaken to explore whether selective pharmacological blockade of NMDA neurotransmission within the core and the shell region affected differentially spontaneous and cocaine-induced locomotor activity. We report that intra-NAC microinfusion of aminophosphonovaleric acid (AP-5) (0.75-3.0 micrograms/side, 1.5-6.0 micrograms total dose) within the core but not the shell region reduced cocaine-induced locomotion in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, microinfusion of the same doses of AP-5 within the shell region caused a dose-dependent increase of spontaneous locomotion, while microinfusion within the core region was ineffective. These results indicate that blockade of NMDA receptors in the core and the shell of the NAC elicited different effects on spontaneous and cocaine-induced locomotion. This suggests that these substructures may subserve different functions within the integrated output of the NAC, functions that may vary according to the state of arousal.", "7508582": "GABAergic and enkephalinergic afferents to the ventral tegmental area were investigated in the rat using retrograde tracing techniques combined with in situ hybridization. Following iontophoretic deposit of Fluoro-Gold in the ventral tegmental area labeling in the forebrain was most dense in the shell of the nucleus accumbens, rostral ventromedial ventral pallidum and diagonal band of Broca. A smaller density was also observed in the lateral septum. In these forebrain regions, the portion of retrogradely labeled cells that contained mRNA  for glutamate decarboxylase ranged from 25% to 50%, whereas only 5% to 15% were double-labeled for preproenkephalin mRNA. Cells double-labeled with either glutamate decarboxylase or preproenkephalin mRNA were most numerous in the lateral septum, shell of the nucleus accumbens, rostral ventral pallidum and diagonal band of Broca. Large Fluoro-Gold deposits which invaded the medial substantia nigra resulted in a significant number of retrogradely labeled cells in the core of the nucleus accumbens, and a portion of these neurons also contained mRNA for glutamate decarboxylase or preproenkephalin. These data demonstrate the presence of GABAergic and enkephalinergic neurons projecting from the nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum and diagonal band of Broca to the ventral tegmental area.", "7070669": "Tritiated leucine and proline injected into the amygdaloid complex was found to label a voluminous amygdalostriatal fiber system which is distributed to all parts of the striatum except an antero-dorsolateral striatal sector. The connection is established by way of the longitudinal association bundle as well as the stria terminalis, and includes a modest (10-15%), symmetrically distributed contralateral component conveyed by the anterior commissure. Both autoradiographic findings and subsequent observations in retrograde cell-labelling (horseradish peroxidase) material indicate that the amygdalostriatal projection originates mainly from the nucleus basalis lateralis  amygdalae, in much lesser volume from the nucleus basalis medialis, and minimally from the nucleus lateralis amygdalae; no other contributing amygdaloid cell group could be identified. A comparison of the present findings with earlier reports indicates that the amygdalostriatal projection widely overlaps the striatal projections from the ventral tegmental area, the mesencephalic raphe nuclei and the prefrontal cortex. Like the amygdalostriatal projection, these striatal afferents largely or entirely avoid the antero-dorsolateral striatal quadrant, which thus appears to be the striatal region most sparsely innervated by afferents originating from structures within the circuitry of the limbic system.  Findings in additional autoradiographic material identify this relatively non-limbic striatal quadrant as the main region of distribution of the corticostriatal projection from the sensorimotor cortex.", "5636851": "Reliable acquisition of the pigeon's key-peck response resulted from repeated unconditional (response-independent) presentations of food after the response key was illuminated momentarily.

The effects on ACh in the NAC and STR were also observed in response to water intake in 20-h water-deprived animals. Neostigmine was used in the perfusate to improve ACh recovery. Basal ACh was sensitive to tetrodotoxin and low calcium, and therefore largely neuronal in origin. Feeding caused a 38% increase in extracellular ACh in the NAC and no change in the STR or HIPP. Dopamine was also increased in the NAC (48%) and to a lesser extent in the STR (21%) following feeding. Drinking caused 18-20% increases in ACh release in both  the NAC and STR. In a separate experiment, ACh release in the NAC was monitored in 10-min intervals during free-feeding; ACh increased in the interval immediately following maximal food intake. These results suggest a site-specific  increase in ACh release following feeding that cannot be solely attributed to the activation associated with this behavior.", "24949967": "Social interaction is a complex behavior essential for many species and is impaired in major neuropsychiatric disorders. Pharmacological studies have implicated certain neurotransmitter systems in social behavior, but circuit-level understanding of endogenous neural activity during social interaction is lacking. We therefore developed and applied a new methodology, termed fiber photometry, to optically record natural neural activity in genetically and connectivity-defined  projections to elucidate the real-time role of specified pathways in mammalian behavior. Fiber photometry revealed that activity dynamics of a ventral tegmental area (VTA)-to-nucleus\u00a0accumbens (NAc) projection could encode and predict key features of social, but not novel object, interaction. Consistent with this observation, optogenetic control of cells specifically contributing to this projection was sufficient to modulate social behavior, which was mediated by type 1 dopamine receptor signaling downstream in the NAc. Direct observation of deep projection-specific activity in this way captures a fundamental and previously inaccessible dimension of mammalian circuit dynamics.", "23100412": "The brain endocannabinoid system plays a crucial role in emotional processes. We  have previously identified an important role for endocannabinoids in social play  behavior, a highly rewarding form of social interaction in adolescent rats. Here, we tested the hypothesis that endocannabinoid modulation of social play behavior  occurs in brain regions implicated in emotion and motivation. Social play increased levels of the endocannabinoid anandamide in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not in prefrontal cortex or hippocampus of 4- to 5-week-old  male Wistar rats. Furthermore, social play increased phosphorylation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the amygdala. Systemic administration of the anandamide  hydrolysis inhibitor URB597 increased social play behavior, and augmented the associated elevation in anandamide levels in the amygdala, but not the NAc. Infusion of URB597 into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) increased social play behavior, and blockade of BLA CB1 cannabinoid receptors with the antagonist/inverse agonist SR141716A prevented the play-enhancing effects of systemic administration of URB597. Infusion of URB597 into the NAc also increased social play, but blockade of NAc CB1 cannabinoid receptors did not antagonize the play-enhancing effects of systemic URB597 treatment. Last, SR141716A did not affect social play after infusion into the core and shell subregions of the NAc,  while it reduced social play when infused into the BLA. These data show that increased anandamide signaling in the amygdala and NAc augments social play, and  identify the BLA as a prominent site of action for endocannabinoids to modulate the rewarding properties of social interactions in adolescent rats.", "22055017": "BACKGROUND: To optimize behavior, organisms evaluate the risks and benefits of available choices. The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system encodes information about  response costs and reward delays that bias choices. However, it remains unclear whether subjective value associated with risk-taking behavior is encoded by DA release. METHODS: Rats (n = 11) were trained on a risk-based decision-making task in which visual cues predicted the opportunity to respond for smaller certain (safer) or larger uncertain (riskier) rewards. Following training, DA release within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was monitored on a rapid time scale using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry during the risk-based decision-making task. RESULTS: Individual differences in risk-taking behavior were observed as animals  displayed a preference for either safe or risky rewards. When only one response option was available, reward predictive cues evoked increases in DA concentration in the NAc core that scaled with each animal's preferred reward contingency. However, when both options were presented simultaneously, cue-evoked DA release signaled the animals preferred reward contingency, regardless of the future choice. Furthermore, DA signaling in the NAc core also tracked unexpected presentations or omissions of rewards following prediction error theory. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the dopaminergic projections to the NAc core encode the subjective value of future rewards that may function to influence future decisions to take risks.", "20962248": "Tonic and phasic dopamine release is implicated in learning, motivation, and motor functions. However, the relationship between spike patterns in dopaminergic neurons, the extracellular concentration of dopamine, and activation of dopamine  receptors remains unresolved. In the present study, we develop a computational model of dopamine signaling that give insight into the relationship between the dynamics of release and occupancy of D(1) and D(2) receptors. The model is derived from first principles using experimental data. It has no free parameters  and offers unbiased estimation of the boundaries of dopaminergic volume transmission. Bursts primarily increase occupancy of D(1) receptors, whereas pauses translate into low occupancy of D(1) and D(2) receptors. Phasic firing patterns, composed of bursts and pauses, reduce the average D(2) receptor occupancy and increase average D(1) receptor occupancy compared with equivalent tonic firing. Receptor occupancy is crucially dependent on synchrony and the balance between tonic and phasic firing modes. Our results provide quantitative insight in the dynamics of volume transmission and complement experimental data obtained with electrophysiology, positron emission tomography, microdialysis, amperometry, and voltammetry.", "15450168": "An important conceptual advance in the past decade has been the understanding that the process of drug addiction shares striking commonalities with neural plasticity associated with natural reward learning and memory. Basic mechanisms involving dopamine, glutamate, and their intracellular and genomic targets have been the focus of attention in this research area. These two neurotransmitter systems, widely distributed in many regions of cortex, limbic system, and basal ganglia, appear to play a key integrative role in motivation, learning, and memory, thus modulating adaptive behavior. However, many drugs of abuse exert their primary effects precisely on these pathways and are able to induce enduring cellular alterations in motivational networks, thus leading to maladaptive behaviors. Current theories and research on this topic are reviewed from an integrative systems perspective, with special emphasis on cellular, molecular, and behavioral aspects of dopamine D-1 and glutamate NMDA signaling, instrumental learning, and drug cue conditioning.", "15146188": "Reward-seeking behaviors depend critically on dopamine signaling--dopamine neurons encode reward-related information by switching from tonic to phasic (burst-like) activity. Using guinea pig brain slices, we show that nicotine, like cocaine and amphetamine, acts directly in striatum where it enhances dopamine release during phasic but not tonic activity. This amplification provides a mechanism for nicotine facilitation of reward-related dopamine signals, including responses to other primary reinforcers that govern nicotine dependence in smokers.", "15146187": "Although nicotine activation of dopamine release is implicated in addiction, it also desensitizes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), leading to a prolonged depression of evoked dopamine release. Here we show that nicotine's effects depend on the firing pattern of dopamine neurons, so that while desensitization of nAChRs indeed curbs dopamine released by stimuli emulating tonic firing, it allows a rapid rise in dopamine from stimuli emulating phasic firing patterns associated with incentive/salience paradigms. Nicotine may thus enhance the contrast of dopamine signals associated with behavioral cues.", "12506716": "Real-time measurements of phasic changes in extracellular dopamine concentration  in freely moving rats by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry.", "22781845": "Inhibitor of \u03baB kinase (I\u03baK) has historically been studied in the context of immune response and inflammation, but recent evidence demonstrates that I\u03baK activity is necessary and sufficient for regulation of neuronal function. Chronic social defeat stress of mice increases I\u03baK activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and this increase is strongly correlated to depression-like behaviors. Inhibition of I\u03baK signaling results in a reversal of chronic social defeat stress-induced social avoidance behavior. Here, we more completely define the role of I\u03baK in anxiety and depressive-like behaviors. Mice underwent stereotaxic  microinjection of a herpes simplex virus expressing either green fluorescent protein, a constitutively active form of I\u03baK (I\u03baKca), or a dominant negative form of I\u03baK into the NAc. Of all three experimental groups, only mice expressing I\u03baKca show a behavioral phenotype. Expression of I\u03baKca results in a decrease in the time spent in the non-periphery zones of an open field arena and increased time spent immobile during a forced swim test. No baseline differences in sucrose preference were observed, but following the acute swim stress we noted a marked reduction in sucrose preference. To determine whether I\u03baK activity alters responses to other acute stressors, we examined behavior and spine morphology in  mice undergoing an acute social defeat stress. We found that I\u03baKca enhanced social avoidance behavior and promoted thin spine formation. These data show that I\u03baK in NAc is a critical regulator of both depressive- and anxiety-like states and may do so by promoting the formation of immature excitatory synapses.", "10771025": "Experimental impairment of dopamine function by 6-hydroxydopamine lesions or by dopamine receptor antagonists shows that dopamine is involved in nicotine's discriminative stimulus properties, nicotine-induced facilitation of intracranial self-stimulation, intravenous nicotine self-administration, nicotine conditioned  place-preference and nicotine-induced disruption of latent inhibition. Therefore, nicotine depends on dopamine for those behavioural effects that are most relevant for its reinforcing properties and are likely to be the basis of the abuse liability of tobacco smoke. On the other hand, in vivo monitoring studies show that nicotine stimulates dopamine transmission in specific brain areas and in particular, in the shell of the nucleus accumbens and in areas of the extended amygdala. These effects of nicotine resemble those of a reward like food except that nicotine-induced release of dopamine does not undergo single-trial, long-lasting habituation. It is speculated that repeated non-habituating stimulation of dopamine release by nicotine in the nucleus accumbens shell abnormally facilitates associative stimulus-reward learning. Acute effects of nicotine on dopamine transmission undergo acute and chronic tolerance; with repeated, discontinuous exposure, sensitization of nicotine-induced stimulation of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core takes place while the response  in the shell is reduced. It is speculated that these adaptive changes are the substrate of a switch from abnormal incentive responding controlled by consequences (action-outcome responding) into abnormal habit responding, triggered by conditional stimuli and automatically driven by action schemata relatively independent from nicotine reward. These two modalities might coexist,  being utilized alternatively in relation to the availability of tobacco. Unavailability of tobacco disrupts the automatic, implicit modality of abnormal habit responding switching responding into the explicit, conscious modality of incentive drug-seeking and craving.", "12649484": "Uncertainty is critical in the measure of information and in assessing the accuracy of predictions. It is determined by probability P, being maximal at P =  0.5 and decreasing at higher and lower probabilities. Using distinct stimuli to indicate the probability of reward, we found that the phasic activation of dopamine neurons varied monotonically across the full range of probabilities, supporting past claims that this response codes the discrepancy between predicted and actual reward. In contrast, a previously unobserved response covaried with uncertainty and consisted of a gradual increase in activity until the potential time of reward. The coding of uncertainty suggests a possible role for dopamine signals in attention-based learning and risk-taking behavior.", "10611493": "Studies addressing behavioral functions of dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens septi (NAS) are reviewed. A role of NAS DA in reward has long been suggested. However, some investigators have questioned the role of NAS DA in rewarding effects because of its role in aversive contexts. As findings supporting the role of NAS DA in mediating aversively motivated behaviors accumulate, it is necessary to accommodate such data for understanding the role of NAS DA in behavior. The aim of the present paper is to provide a unifying interpretation that can account for the functions of NAS DA in a variety of behavioral contexts: (1) its role in  appetitive behavioral arousal, (2) its role as a facilitator as well as an inducer of reward processes, and (3) its presently undefined role in aversive contexts. The present analysis suggests that NAS DA plays an important role in sensorimotor integrations that facilitate flexible approach responses. Flexible approach responses are contrasted with fixed instrumental approach responses (habits), which may involve the nigro-striatal DA system more than the meso-accumbens DA system. Functional properties of NAS DA transmission are considered in two stages: unconditioned behavioral invigoration effects and incentive learning effects. (1) When organisms are presented with salient stimuli (e.g., novel stimuli and incentive stimuli), NAS DA is released and invigorates flexible approach responses (invigoration effects). (2) When proximal exteroceptive receptors are stimulated by unconditioned stimuli, NAS DA is released and enables stimulus representations to acquire incentive properties within specific environmental context. It is important to make a distinction that NAS DA is a critical component for the conditional formation of incentive representations but not the retrieval of incentive stimuli or behavioral expressions based on over-learned incentive responses (i.e., habits). Nor is NAS  DA essential for the cognitive perception of environmental stimuli. Therefore, even without normal NAS DA transmission, the habit response system still allows animals to perform instrumental responses given that the tasks take place in fixed environment. Such a role of NAS DA as an incentive-property constructor is  not limited to appetitive contexts but also aversive contexts. This dual action of NAS DA in invigoration and incentive learning may explain the rewarding effects of NAS DA as well as other effects of NAS DA in a variety of contexts including avoidance and unconditioned/conditioned increases in open-field locomotor activity. Particularly, the present hypothesis offers the following interpretation for the finding that both conditioned and unconditioned aversive stimuli stimulate DA release in the NAS: NAS DA invigorates approach responses toward 'safety'. Moreover, NAS DA modulates incentive properties of the environment so that organisms emit approach responses toward 'safety' (i.e., avoidance responses) when animals later encounter similar environmental contexts. There may be no obligatory relationship between NAS DA release and positive subjective effects, even though these systems probably interact with other brain  systems which can mediate such effects. The present conceptual framework may be valuable in understanding the dynamic interplay of NAS DA neurochemistry and behavior, both normal and pathophysiological.", "23516454": "The development of diet-induced obesity (DIO) can potently alter multiple aspects of dopamine signaling, including dopamine transporter (DAT) expression and dopamine reuptake. However, the time-course of diet-induced changes in DAT expression and function and whether such changes are dependent upon the development of DIO remains unresolved. Here, we fed rats a high (HFD) or low (LFD) fat diet for 2 or 6 weeks. Following diet exposure, rats were anesthetized  with urethane and striatal DAT function was assessed by electrically stimulating  the dopamine cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and recording resultant changes in dopamine concentration in the ventral striatum using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. We also quantified the effect of HFD on membrane associated DAT in striatal cell fractions from a separate group of rats following exposure to the same diet protocol. Notably, none of our treatment groups differed in body weight. We found a deficit in the rate of dopamine reuptake in HFD rats relative to LFD rats after 6 but not 2 weeks of diet exposure. Additionally, the increase in evoked dopamine following a pharmacological challenge of cocaine was significantly attenuated in HFD relative to LFD rats. Western blot analysis revealed that there was no effect of diet on total DAT protein. However, 6 weeks of HFD exposure significantly reduced the 50 kDa DAT isoform in a synaptosomal membrane-associated fraction, but not in a fraction associated with recycling endosomes. Our data provide further evidence for diet-induced alterations in dopamine reuptake independent of changes in DAT production and demonstrates that such changes can manifest without the development of DIO.", "23184975": "Drug addiction is a neuropsychiatric disorder that marks the end stage of a progression beginning with recreational drug taking but culminating in habitual and compulsive drug use. This progression is considered to reflect transitions among multiple neural loci. Dopamine neurotransmission in the ventromedial striatum (VMS) is pivotal in the control of initial drug use, but emerging evidence indicates that once drug use is well established, its control is dominated by the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). In the current work, we conducted longitudinal neurochemical recordings to ascertain the spatiotemporal profile of  striatal dopamine release and to investigate how it changes during the period from initial to established drug use. Dopamine release was detected using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry simultaneously in the VMS and DLS of rats bearing indwelling i.v. catheters over the course of 3 wk of cocaine self-administration. We found that phasic dopamine release in DLS emerged progressively during drug taking over the course of weeks, a period during which VMS dopamine signaling declined. This emergent dopamine signaling in the DLS mediated discriminated behavior to obtain drug but did not promote escalated or compulsive drug use. We  also demonstrate that this recruitment of dopamine signaling in the DLS is dependent on antecedent activity in VMS circuitry. Thus, the current findings identify a striatal hierarchy that is instantiated during the expression of established responses to obtain cocaine.", "22522908": "Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is a common analytical electrochemistry tool  used to measure chemical species. It has recently been adapted for measurement of neurotransmitters such as dopamine in awake and behaving animals (in vivo). Electrode calibration is an essential step in FSCV to relate observed current to  concentration of a chemical species. However, existing methods require multiple components, which reduce the ease of calibrations. To this end, a microfluidic flow cell (\u03bcFC) was developed as a simple device to switch between buffer and buffer with a known concentration of the analyte of interest--in this case dopamine--in a microfluidic Y-channel. The ability to quickly switch solutions yielded electrode calibrations with faster rise times and that were more stable at peak current values. The \u03bcFC reduced the number of external electrical components and produced linear calibrations over a range of concentrations. To demonstrate this, an electrode calibrated with the \u03bcFC was used in FSCV recordings from a rat during the delivery of food reward--a stimulus that reliably evokes a brief increase in current due to the oxidation of dopamine. Using the linear calibration, dopamine concentrations were determined from the current responses evoked during the behavioral task. The \u03bcFC is able to easily and quickly calibrate FSCV electrode responses to chemical species for both in vitro and in vivo experiments.", "22492036": "The glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) system is a recently established target for type 2 diabetes treatment. In addition to regulating glucose homeostasis, GLP-1 also reduces food intake. Previous studies demonstrate that the anorexigenic effects of GLP-1 can be mediated through hypothalamic and brainstem circuits which regulate homeostatic feeding. Here, we demonstrate an entirely novel neurobiological mechanism for GLP-1-induced anorexia in rats, involving direct effects of a GLP-1 agonist, Exendin-4 (EX4) on food reward that are exerted at the level of the mesolimbic reward system. We assessed the impact of peripheral,  central, and intramesolimbic EX4 on two models of food reward: conditioned place  preference (CPP) and progressive ratio operant-conditioning. Food-reward behavior was reduced in the CPP test by EX4, as rats no longer preferred an environment previously paired to chocolate pellets. EX4 also decreased motivated behavior for sucrose in a progressive ratio operant-conditioning paradigm when administered peripherally. We show that this effect is mediated centrally, via GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs). GLP-1Rs are expressed in several key nodes of the mesolimbic reward system; however, their function remains unexplored. Thus we sought to determine the neurobiological substrates underlying the food-reward effect. We found that the EX4-mediated inhibition of food reward could be driven from two key mesolimbic structures-ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens-without inducing concurrent malaise or locomotor impairment. The current findings, that activation of central GLP-1Rs strikingly suppresses food reward/motivation by interacting with the mesolimbic system, indicate an entirely novel mechanism by which the GLP-1R stimulation affects feeding-oriented behavior.", "21764750": "Reward-motivated behavior is strongly influenced by the learned significance of contextual stimuli in the environment. However, the neural pathways that mediate  context-reward relations are not well understood. We have identified a circuit from area CA3 of dorsal hippocampus to ventral tegmental area (VTA) that uses lateral septum (LS) as a relay. Theta frequency stimulation of CA3 excited VTA dopamine (DA) neurons and inhibited non-DA neurons. DA neuron excitation was likely mediated by disinhibition because local antagonism of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid  receptors blocked responses to CA3 stimulation. Inactivating components of the CA3-LS-VTA pathway blocked evoked responses in VTA and also reinstatement of cocaine-seeking by contextual stimuli. This transsynaptic link between hippocampus and VTA appears to be an important substrate by which environmental context regulates goal-directed behavior.", "19735286": "Mesolimbic dopamine neurons projecting from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are part of a complex circuit mediating cocaine-directed  behaviors. However, the precise role of rapid (subsecond) dopamine release within the primary subregions of the NAc (the core and shell) and its relationship to NAc cell firing during this behavior remain unknown. Here, using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in rats we report rapid dopamine signaling in both the core and shell; however, significant differences were observed in the timing of dopamine release events within seconds of the cocaine-reinforced response during self-administration sessions. Importantly, simultaneous voltammetric and electrophysiological recordings from the same electrode reveal that, at certain sites within both subregions, neurons exhibiting patterned activation were observed at locations where rapid dopamine release was present; the greater the strength of the neural signal the larger the dopamine release event. In addition, it was at those locations that electrically-evoked stimulated release was greatest. No changes in dopamine were observed where nonphasic neurons were recorded. Thus, although differences are evident in dopamine release dynamics relative to cocaine-reinforced responding within the core and shell, dopamine release is heterogeneous within each structure and varies as a function of precise neuronal targets during cocaine-seeking behavior.", "16724186": "RATIONALE: A large body of evidence indicates an involvement of the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway innervating the ventral striatum in the motivational effects of drug abuse. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the study is to clarify the role of DA D1 and D2 receptors of the rat nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and core in the motivational effects of  morphine as studied by conditioned place preference (CPP). METHODS: The effect of the intracerebral infusion of DA antagonists specific for  DA D1 (SCH 39166) and D2 receptors (L-sulpiride) was studied in a single-trial place conditioning paradigm with fixed assignment of the drug to the unpreferred  compartment. RESULTS: Morphine induced significant CPP at all the doses tested (0.5, 1.0, and  2.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously). A dose of 1.0 mg/kg was selected for further studies. Intra-NAc shell infusion of SCH 39166 and L-sulpiride at doses of 25 and 50 ng/1  microl per side impaired the acquisition of CPP by morphine. No effect was observed at 12.5 ng/1 microl per side. Intra-NAc core infusion of SCH 39166 (12.5, 25, and 50 ng/1 microl per side) did not affect the acquisition of morphine-induced CPP, while L-sulpiride (12.5, 25, and 50 ng/1 microl per side) impaired CPP acquisition only at the dose of 50 ng/1 microl per side. No effect on morphine-induced CPP was observed when the DA antagonists were infused into the NAc shell or core 10 min before the test session.

In this work, we evaluated the ability of cyclic voltammograms recorded at fast-scan rates to resolve neurochemicals when analyzed by principal component regression. A calibration set of 30 cyclic voltammograms was constructed from 9 different substances at a variety of concentrations. The set was reduced by principal component analysis, and it was found that 99.5% of the variance in the data could be captured with five principal components. This set was used to evaluate cyclic voltammograms obtained with one or two compounds  present in solution. In most cases, satisfactory predictions of the identity and  concentration of analytes were obtained. Chemical dynamics were also resolved from a set of fast-scan cyclic voltammograms obtained with the electrode implanted in a region of a brain slice that contains dopaminergic terminals. Following stimulation, principal component regression of the data resolved the changes in dopamine and pH that were evoked. In a second test of the method, vesicular release was measured from adrenal medullary cells and the data were evaluated with a calibration set composed of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Cells that secreted one or the other were identified. Overall, the results show that principal component regression with appropriate calibration data allows resolution of substances that give overlapping cyclic voltammograms.", "15138757": "RATIONALE: The nucleus accumbens (NAC) is theorized to be a critical element of the neural circuitry that mediates relapse to cocaine seeking. Evidence suggests  that the NAC is a functionally heterogeneous structure, and the core (NACc) and shell (NACs) regions of the NAC may play a differential role in stimulus-induced  motivated behavior. Thus, determination of the involvement of NAC subregions in conditioned cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking is warranted. OBJECTIVES: The present study compared the effects of GABA agonist-induced inactivation of the NACc versus NACs on conditioned cue-induced reinstatement of  cocaine seeking behavior. METHODS: Rats were trained to lever press for cocaine infusions (0.20 mg/infusion, IV) paired with presentations of a light-tone stimulus complex. Responding was then allowed to extinguish prior to reinstatement testing. Reinstatement of cocaine seeking (i.e. responses on the previously cocaine-paired lever) was measured in the presence of response-contingent presentation of the light-tone stimulus complex following microinfusion of muscimol+baclofen (Mus+Bac, 0.1/1.0 mM, respectively, 0.3 microl/side) or vehicle into the NACc or  NACs. The effects of these manipulations on locomotor activity were also examined. RESULTS: Mus+Bac-induced inactivation of the NACc abolished, whereas inactivation of the NACs failed to alter, conditioned cue-induced reinstatement of operant responding relative to vehicle pretreatment. Time course analyses of the effects  of these manipulations on locomotion versus operant responding confirmed that the effects of Mus+Bac on reinstatement were not due to suppression of general activity. CONCLUSIONS: The functional integrity of the NACc, but not the NACs, is necessary for conditioned cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking behavior.", "12867514": "Convergent evidence suggests that amphetamine (AMPH) exerts its rewarding and locomotor stimulating effects via release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. However, there is no consensus as to the relative contributions of core and medial shell subregions to these effects. Moreover, the literature is based primarily on intracranial administration, which cannot fully mimic the drug distribution achieved by systemic administration. In the present study, the effects of bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the accumbens core or medial shell on rewarding and locomotor stimulating effects of systemically administered amphetamine (0.75 mg/kg, i.p.) were examined in a conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure relying solely on tactile cues (floor texture). Residual dopamine innervation was quantified by [125I]-RTI-55 binding to the dopamine transporter.  When lesions were performed before the conditioning phase, AMPH-induced locomotor stimulation and CPP magnitude were positively correlated with residual dopamine transporter binding in core and medial shell, respectively. Medial shell lesions  did not affect morphine CPP, arguing that a sensory or mnemonic deficit was not responsible for the lesion-induced reduction in AMPH CPP. Medial shell lesions performed between the conditioning phase and the test day reduced the expression  of amphetamine CPP. These results suggest that after systemic amphetamine administration, rewarding and locomotor stimulating effects of the drug are anatomically dissociated within the nucleus accumbens: the medial shell contributes to rewarding effects, whereas the core contributes to behavioral activation.", "12445717": "Drug addiction can be conceptualized as a disturbance of behavior motivated by drug-conditioned incentives. This abnormality has been explained by Incentive-Sensitization and Allostatic-Counteradaptive theories as the result of  non-associative mechanisms acting at the stage of the expression of incentive motivation and responding for drug reinforcement. Each one of these theories, however, does not account per se for two basic properties of the motivational disturbance of drug addiction: (1). focussing on drug- at the expenses of non-drug-incentives; (2). virtual irreversibility. To account for the above aspects we have proposed an associative learning hypothesis. According to this hypothesis the basic disturbance of drug addiction takes place at the stage of acquisition of motivation and in particular of Pavlovian incentive learning. Drugs share with non-drug rewards the property of stimulating dopamine (DA) transmission in the nucleus accumbens shell but this effect does not undergo habituation upon repeated drug exposure, as instead is the case of non-drug rewards. Repetitive, non-decremental stimulation of DA transmission by drugs in the nucleus accumbens septi (NAc) shell abnormally strengthens stimulus-drug associations. Thus, stimuli contingent upon drug reward acquire powerful incentive properties after a relatively limited number of predictive associations with the drug and become particularly resistant to extinction. Non-contingent occurrence of drug-conditioned incentive cues or contexts strongly facilitates and eventually reinstates drug self-administration. Repeated drug exposure also induces a process of sensitization of drug-induced stimulation of DA transmission in the NAc core. The precise significance of this adaptive change for the mechanism of drug addiction is unclear given the complexity and uncertainties surrounding the role of NAc core DA in responding but might be more directly related to instrumental performance.", "8618890": "The nucleus accumbens is considered a critical target of the action of drugs of abuse. In this nucleus a \"shell\" and a \"core\" have been distinguished on the basis of anatomical and histochemical criteria. The present study investigated the effect in freely moving rats of intravenous cocaine, amphetamine, and morphine on extracellular dopamine concentrations in the nucleus accumbens shell  and core by means of microdialysis with vertically implanted concentric probes. Doses selected were in the range of those known to sustain drug self-administration in rats. Morphine, at 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg, and cocaine, at 0.5  mg/kg, increased extracellular dopamine selectivity in the shell. Higher doses of cocaine (1.0 mg/kg) and the lowest dose of amphetamine tested (0.125 mg/kg) increased extracellular dopamine both in the shell and in the core, but the effect was significantly more pronounced in the shell compared with the core. Only the highest dose of amphetamine (0.250 mg/kg) increased extracellular dopamine in the shell and in the core to a similar extent. The present results provide in vivo neurochemical evidence for a functional compartmentation within the nucleus accumbens and for a preferential effect of psychostimulants and morphine in the shell of the nucleus accumbens at doses known to sustain intravenous drug self-administration.", "7996208": "The firing patterns of nucleus accumbens (NA) neurons in the rat were recorded during cocaine self-administration and responding for water. Recordings were obtained from permanently implanted multiple-electrode arrays (eight microwires)  inserted bilaterally into rostral portions of the NA in subjects (n = 18) exhibiting stable cocaine self-administration (0.33 mg/infusion), and during stable responding for water reinforcement. Electronically isolated and identified NA neurons exhibited four distinct patterns of phasic activity relative to the reinforced response. Three of these firing patterns were observed during both cocaine self-administration and water reinforcement sessions. Response-related activity was categorized by cells that showed an anticipatory increase in firing  rate during the preresponse phase (type PR), and by cells that were excited (type RFE) or inhibited (type RFI) following the response in the reinforcement phase. PR and RFE cells showed significantly reduced peak firing during cocaine self-administration, compared to similar cells in water reinforcement sessions. A fourth type of NA firing pattern (type PR+RF) was observed only in cells recorded during cocaine self-administration sessions (Carelli et al., 1993b). PR+RF neurons exhibited two distinct peaks, one preceding the response and terminating  at response completion (like PR cells), and a second peak immediately following the response (like RFE cells) with an inhibitory period between the two peaks (like RFI cells).

Here, we recorded BLA neurons during the retrieval of associative memories and used optogenetic-mediated phototagging to identify populations of neurons that synapse in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the central amygdala (CeA), or ventral hippocampus (vHPC). We found that despite heterogeneous neural responses within each population, the proportions of BLA-NAc neurons excited by reward predictive  cues and of BLA-CeA neurons excited by aversion predictive cues were higher than  within the entire BLA. Although the BLA-vHPC projection is known to drive behaviors of innate negative valence, these neurons did not preferentially code for learned negative valence. Together, these findings suggest that valence encoding in the BLA is at least partially mediated via divergent activity of anatomically defined neural populations.", "21745635": "Both observational and perturbational technologies are essential for advancing the understanding of brain function and dysfunction. But while observational techniques have greatly advanced in the last century, techniques for perturbation that are matched to the speed and heterogeneity of neural systems have lagged behind.

Reliable and targetable single-component tools (which encompass both light sensation and effector function within a single protein) have enabled versatile new classes of investigation in the study of neural systems.

They must therefore evaluate the magnitude and the likelihood of the available outcomes. Little is known of the neural basis of this process, or what might predispose individuals to be overly conservative or to take risks excessively (avoiding or preferring uncertainty, respectively). The nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) is known to contribute to rats' ability to choose large, delayed rewards over small, immediate rewards; AcbC lesions cause impulsive choice and an impairment in learning with delayed reinforcement. However, it is not known how the AcbC contributes to choice involving probabilistic reinforcement, such as between a large, uncertain reward and a small, certain reward. We examined the effects of excitotoxic lesions of the AcbC on probabilistic choice in rats. RESULTS: Rats chose between a single food pellet delivered with certainty (p = 1) and four food pellets delivered with varying degrees of uncertainty (p = 1, 0.5,  0.25, 0.125, and 0.0625) in a discrete-trial task, with the large-reinforcer probability decreasing or increasing across the session. Subjects were trained on this task and then received excitotoxic or sham lesions of the AcbC before being  retested. After a transient period during which AcbC-lesioned rats exhibited relative indifference between the two alternatives compared to controls, AcbC-lesioned rats came to exhibit risk-averse choice, choosing the large reinforcer less often than controls when it was uncertain, to the extent that they obtained less food as a result. Rats behaved as if indifferent between a single certain pellet and four pellets at p = 0.32 (sham-operated) or at p = 0.70 (AcbC-lesioned) by the end of testing. When the probabilities did not vary across the session, AcbC-lesioned rats and controls strongly preferred the large reinforcer when it was certain, and strongly preferred the small reinforcer when  the large reinforcer was very unlikely (p = 0.0625), with no differences between  AcbC-lesioned and sham-operated groups. CONCLUSION: These results support the view that the AcbC contributes to action selection by promoting the choice of uncertain, as well as delayed, reinforcement.", "12763065": "The nucleus accumbens is regarded as the limbic-motor interface, in view of its limbic afferent and somatomotor and autonomic efferent connections. Within the accumbens, there appear to be specific areas in which limbic afferent fibres, derived from the hippocampus and the amygdala, overlap. These afferent inputs have been suggested to converge monosynaptically on cells within the accumbens and are hypothesized to play a role in paradigms such as conditioned place preference. Convergence between inputs from basolateral amygdala and hippocampus  can be demonstrated with electrophysiological recording methods, but these do not conclusively preclude polysynaptic mechanisms. We examined the synaptic input to  the projection neurons of the accumbens, the medium-sized densely spiny neurons.  We labelled the projection neurons with a small injection of biotinylated dextran amine into the accumbens, and the afferents from the basolateral amygdala and ventral subiculum of the hippocampus with injections of biotinylated dextran amine and Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin respectively, and revealed the anterogradely labelled fibres with different chromogens. The labelled accumbens-projection neurons were studied with correlated light and electron microscopy for identified monosynaptic inputs. With this technique we have demonstrated anatomically that monosynaptic convergence between the ventral subicular region of the hippocampus and the basolateral region of the amygdala occurs at the level of the proximal as well as distal dendrites. Finally, we suggest that these anatomical arrangements may represent the framework for the integrative role that has been assigned to the accumbens.", "15019432": "Psychostimulant drugs like amphetamine are readily self-administered by humans and laboratory animals by virtue of their actions on dopamine (DA) neurons in the midbrain. Exposing animals to this drug either systemically or in the cell body region of these neurons in the ventral tegmental area leads to long-lasting alterations in dopaminergic function. These have most often been assessed as increased locomotor activity and enhanced DA overflow in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) after re-exposure to the drug weeks to months later. Evidence is presented showing that manipulations that produce this sensitization of midbrain DA neuron  reactivity enhance the pursuit and self-administration of psychostimulant drugs.  Procedures known to prevent the induction of sensitization by amphetamine also prevent the facilitation of drug taking. Enhanced drug self-administration and primed reinstatement of drug seeking are also accompanied by enhanced NAcc DA reactivity. Finally, drugs that increase NAcc DA overflow acutely but fail to produce sensitization of this effect are not associated with the subsequent enhancement of self-administration. These results indicate a direct relationship  between the sensitization of midbrain dopamine neuron reactivity and the excessive pursuit and self-administration of psychostimulant drugs. Understanding the neuronal events and adaptations that underlie the induction and expression of sensitization may thus help elucidate how drug abuse develops, how it is reinstated and ultimately how both may be prevented.", "25887240": "Depression is a common cause of mortality and morbidity, but the biological bases of the deficits in emotional and cognitive processing remain incompletely understood.

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses  sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 \u00d7 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

We propose opposing roles for dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) in the NAc in the control of GABA output systems for approach and avoidance. Contrary to DA, which fosters approach, ACh release is a correlate or cause of meal satiation, conditioned taste aversion and aversive brain stimulation. ACh may also counteract excessive DA-mediated approach behavior as revealed during withdrawal from drugs of abuse or sugar when the animal enters an ACh-mediated state of anxiety and behavioral depression.

Such addiction-related memories are particularly robust and long-lasting and once formed are less amenable to updating. Here we propose a neural rejuvenation hypothesis of cocaine addiction. According to this  hypothesis, repeated exposure to drugs of abuse induces some plasticity mechanisms normally associated with brain development within the reward circuitry that mediate the highly efficient and unusually stable memory abnormalities that  characterize addiction.", "24712995": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in plasticity at glutamate synapses and in the effects of repeated cocaine exposure. We recently showed that intracranial injection of BDNF into the rat nucleus accumbens (NAc),  a key region for cocaine addiction, rapidly increases \u03b1-amino-3-hyroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) surface expression. To further characterize BDNF's role in both rapid AMPAR trafficking and slower, homeostatic changes in AMPAR surface expression, we investigated the  effects of acute (30\u00a0min) and long-term (24\u00a0h) treatment with BDNF on AMPAR distribution in NAc medium spiny neurons from postnatal rats co-cultured with mouse prefrontal cortex neurons to restore excitatory inputs. Immunocytochemical  studies showed that acute BDNF treatment increased cell surface GluA1 and GluA2 levels, as well as their co-localization, on NAc neurons. This effect of BDNF, confirmed using a protein crosslinking assay, was dependent on ERK but not AKT signaling. In contrast, long-term BDNF treatment decreased AMPAR surface expression on NAc neurons. Based on this latter result, we tested the hypothesis  that BDNF plays a role in AMPAR 'scaling down' in response to a prolonged increase in neuronal activity produced by bicuculline (24\u00a0h). Supporting this hypothesis, decreasing BDNF signaling with the extracellular BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc prevented the scaling down of GluA1 and GluA2 surface levels in NAc neurons normally produced by bicuculline. In conclusion, BDNF exerts bidirectional effects on NAc AMPAR surface expression, depending on duration of exposure. Furthermore, BDNF's involvement in synaptic scaling in the NAc differs  from its previously described role in the visual cortex.", "22347846": "Neurons possess diverse mechanisms of homeostatic adaptation to overall changes in neural and synaptic activity, which are critical for proper brain functions. Homeostatic regulation of excitatory synapses has been studied in the context of  synaptic scaling, which allows neurons to adjust their excitatory synaptic gain to maintain their activity within a dynamic range. Recent evidence suggests that  one of the main mechanisms underlying synaptic scaling is by altering the function of postsynaptic \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), including synaptic expression of Ca(2+)-permeable (CP-) AMPARs. CP-AMPARs endow synapses with unique properties, which may benefit adaptation of neurons to periods of inactivity as would occur when a major input  is lost.

Recent work has shown that these destabilizing influences are counterbalanced by homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that act to stabilize neuronal and circuit activity. One such mechanism is synaptic scaling, which allows neurons to detect changes in their own firing rates through a set of calcium-dependent sensors that then regulate receptor trafficking to increase or  decrease the accumulation of glutamate receptors at synaptic sites. Additional homeostatic mechanisms may allow local changes in synaptic activation to generate local synaptic adaptations, and network-wide changes in activity to generate network-wide adjustments in the balance between excitation and inhibition. The signaling pathways underlying these various forms of homeostatic plasticity are currently under intense scrutiny, and although dozens of molecular pathways have  now been implicated in homeostatic plasticity, a clear picture of how homeostatic feedback is structured at the molecular level has not yet emerged.

We also measured GluA1 phosphorylated at serine 845 (pS845 GluA1) and serine 831 (pS831 GluA1). GluA1-3 protein levels and pS831 GluA1/total GluA1 were higher in synaptic membranes. However, pS845 GluA1/total GluA1 was higher in extrasynaptic  membranes, consistent with a role for S845 phosphorylation in GluA1 insertion at  extrasynaptic sites. Homeric GluA1 receptors were detected in extrasynaptic membranes, consistent with evidence for extrasynaptic Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs in  other systems. The TARP \u03b3-2 was enriched in synaptic membranes, whereas \u03b3-4 was mainly found in extrasynaptic membranes, suggesting distinct roles for these proteins in the NAc.

Certain types of neural activity can recruit Ca(2+)-permeable (CP) AMPARs, such as GluR1 homomers, to synapses likely  via lateral diffusion from extrasynaptic sites. Here we show that GluR1-S845 phosphorylation can alter the subunit composition of perisynaptic AMPARs by providing stability to GluR1 homomers. Using mice specifically lacking phosphorylation of the GluR1-S845 site (GluR1-S845A mutants), we demonstrate that this site is necessary for maintaining CP-AMPARs. Specifically, in the GluR1-S845A mutants, CP-AMPARs were absent from perisynaptic locations mainly due to lysosomal degradation. This regulation was mimicked by acute desphosphorylation of the GluR1-S845 site in wild-type mice by NMDA application.  Furthermore, long-term depression (LTD) was associated with a reduction in perisynaptic CP-AMPAR levels.

Cortical neurons restore excitatory input onto NAc neurons but are distinguishable based on fluorescence. First, we showed  that brief D1-like agonist exposure increased AMPAR insertion onto extrasynaptic  regions of NAc neuronal processes through a mechanism requiring protein kinase A. This facilitated the Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)-dependent synaptic incorporation of AMPARs in response to subsequent NMDA receptor (NMDAR) stimulation. Through this mechanism, DA may promote reward- and drug-related plasticity in the NAc. Then, to model effects of repeated in vivo cocaine exposure, we treated cocultures with DA (1 microm, 30 min) on days 7, 9, and 11 in culture. On day 15, NAc neurons exhibited increased synaptic AMPAR levels. This was associated with CaMKII activation and was blocked by the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (N-[2-[N-(4-chlorocinnamyl)-N-methylaminomethyl]phenyl]-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-meth oxybenzenesulfonamide phosphate salt). Furthermore, D1-like agonist exposure on day 15 no longer increased AMPAR surface expression. This refractoriness was associated with decreased D1 receptor surface expression. NMDAR surface expression was not altered by acute or repeated DA receptor stimulation. These results suggest that (1) after repeated DA treatment, NAc neurons are more responsive to glutamate inputs but D(1)-like receptor regulation of plasticity is impaired, and (2) NAc/prefrontal cortex cocultures are useful for studying dopamine-induced neuroadaptations.", "17360685": "alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors mediate the majority of excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. Recent studies have shown that activation of PKA regulates the membrane trafficking of the AMPA  receptor Glu receptor 1 (GluR1) subunit, but the role of direct phosphorylation of GluR1 in regulating receptor redistribution is not clear. Here we show that phosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit on serine 845 by PKA is required for PKA-induced increases in AMPA receptor cell-surface expression because it promotes receptor insertion and decreases receptor endocytosis. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of GluR1 serine 845 triggers NMDA-induced AMPA receptor internalization. These findings strongly suggest that dynamic changes in direct phosphorylation of GluR1 by PKA are crucial in the modulation of AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity.", "16713568": "Activity deprivation in neurons induces a slow compensatory scaling up of synaptic strength, reflecting a homeostatic mechanism for stabilizing neuronal activity. Prior studies have focused on the loss of action potential (AP) driven  neurotransmission in synaptic homeostasis. Here, we show that the miniature synaptic transmission that persists during AP blockade profoundly shapes the time course and mechanism of homeostatic scaling. A brief blockade of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) mediated miniature synaptic events (\"minis\") rapidly scales up synaptic strength, over an order of magnitude faster than with AP blockade alone. The rapid scaling induced by NMDAR mini blockade is mediated by increased synaptic expression of surface GluR1 and the transient incorporation of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors at synapses; both of these changes are implemented locally within  dendrites and require dendritic protein synthesis. These results indicate that NMDAR signaling during miniature synaptic transmission serves to stabilize synaptic function through active suppression of dendritic protein synthesis.", "16272153": "Enhancement of synaptic transmission, as occurs in long-term potentiation (LTP),  can result from several mechanisms that are regulated by phosphorylation of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR). Using a quantitative assay of net serine 845 (Ser-845) phosphorylation in the GluR1 subunit of AMPARs, we investigated the relationship between phospho-Ser-845, GluR1 surface expression, and synaptic strength in hippocampal neurons. About 15% of surface AMPARs in cultured neurons  were phosphorylated at Ser-845 basally, whereas chemical potentiation (forskolin/rolipram treatment) persistently increased this to 60% and chemical depression (N-methyl-D-aspartate treatment) decreased it to 10%. These changes in Ser-845 phosphorylation were paralleled by corresponding changes in the surface expression of AMPARs in both cultured neurons and hippocampal slices. For every 1% increase in net phospho-Ser-845, there was 0.75% increase in the surface fraction of GluR1. Phosphorylation of Ser-845 correlated with a selective delivery of AMPARs to extrasynaptic sites, and their synaptic localization required coincident synaptic activity. Furthermore, increasing the extrasynaptic  pool of AMPA receptors resulted in stronger theta burst LTP. Our results support  a two-step model for delivery of GluR1-containing AMPARs to synapses during activity-dependent LTP, where Ser-845 phosphorylation can traffic AMPARs to extrasynaptic sites for subsequent delivery to synapses during LTP.", "15255976": "In hippocampus and other regions, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors are inserted into synapses during long-term potentiation and removed during long-term depression. However, little is known about regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), despite growing evidence that glutamate-dependent forms of plasticity in the NAc contribute to drug addiction.  Using postnatal rat NAc cultures and an immunocytochemical method that selectively detects newly internalized GluR1, we studied the regulation of AMPA receptor internalization in NAc neurons by glutamate agonists. Newly internalized GluR1 was detected during 15 or 30 min of incubation at room temperature, indicating a basal rate of GluR1 turnover. The rate of GluR1 internalization was  increased by glutamate (50 microM) within 5 min of its addition. Glutamate-induced GluR1 internalization was partially blocked by either an AMPA receptor antagonist (CNQX; 20 microM) or an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor  antagonist (APV; 50 microM). Both NMDA (50 microM) and AMPA (50 microM) increased GluR1 internalization in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. The NMDA effect was blocked by APV while the AMPA effect was blocked by APV or CNQX. We interpret these findings to suggest that NMDA and AMPA ultimately trigger GluR1 internalization through the same NMDA receptor-dependent pathway. The effect of glutamate was also partially blocked by the group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist  N-phenyl-7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxamide (PHCCC; 50 microM),  while the group 1 agonist 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG; 50 microM) stimulated GluR1 internalization. These data suggest that AMPA receptors on NAc neurons may  be subject to rapid regulation of their surface expression in response to changes in the activity of glutamate inputs from cortical and limbic regions.", "15009682": "Trafficking of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors is an important determinant of synaptic strength. Our prior work suggests that D1 dopamine (DA) receptors regulate AMPA receptor trafficking. This is a possible mechanism by which amphetamine and cocaine, which indirectly stimulate D1 receptors, may alter synaptic strength in addiction-related neuronal circuits. Post-natal rat nucleus accumbens (NAc) cultures were used to study the  role of protein kinase A (PKA) in D1 receptor regulation of the surface expression of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1. Using an immunocytochemical assay  that selectively detects newly externalized GluR1, we found that the rate of GluR1 externalization is enhanced by the D1 agonist SKF 81297 (100 nm-1 microm).  This was blocked by a D1 receptor antagonist (SCH 23390; 10 microm) and by two different cell-permeable PKA inhibitors, KT5720 (2 and 10 microm) and RpcAMPS (10 microm). Conversely, the PKA activator SpcAMPS increased the rate of GluR1 externalization in a concentration-dependent manner. A maximally effective concentration of SpcAMPS (10 microm) occluded the effect of SKF 81297 (1 microm)  on GluR1 externalization. Using similar cultures, we showed previously that D1 receptor stimulation increases GluR1 phosphorylation at the PKA site. Together, our findings suggest that PKA phosphorylation of GluR1 is required for GluR1 externalization in response to D1 receptor stimulation.", "14735113": "Author information:  (1)Department of Biology and Volen National Center for Complex Systems, Brandeis  University, Waltham, Massachusetts 02454, USA. turrigano@brandeis.edu", "12536214": "The regulated incorporation of AMPA receptors into synapses is important for synaptic plasticity. Here we examine the role of protein kinase A (PKA) in this process. We found that PKA phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor subunits GluR4 and GluR1 directly controlled the synaptic incorporation of AMPA receptors in organotypic slices from rat hippocampus. Activity-driven PKA phosphorylation of GluR4 was necessary and sufficient to relieve a retention interaction and drive receptors into synapses. In contrast, PKA phosphorylation of GluR1 and the activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) were both necessary for receptor incorporation. Thus, PKA phosphorylation of AMPA receptor subunits contributes to diverse mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity.", "11348590": "AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPA-Rs) mediate a majority of excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. In hippocampus, most AMPA-Rs are hetero-oligomers composed of GluR1/GluR2 or GluR2/GluR3 subunits. Here we show that these AMPA-R forms display different synaptic delivery mechanisms. GluR1/GluR2 receptors are added to synapses during plasticity; this requires interactions between GluR1 and group I PDZ domain proteins. In contrast, GluR2/GluR3 receptors replace existing  synaptic receptors continuously; this occurs only at synapses that already have AMPA-Rs and requires interactions by GluR2 with NSF and group II PDZ domain proteins. The combination of regulated addition and continuous replacement of synaptic receptors can stabilize long-term changes in synaptic efficacy and may serve as a general model for how surface receptor number is established and maintained.", "21209217": "The neurobiological underpinnings of mood and anxiety disorders have been linked  to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region important in processing the rewarding and emotional salience of stimuli. Using chronic social defeat stress, an animal  model of mood and anxiety disorders, we investigated whether alterations in synaptic plasticity are responsible for the long-lasting behavioral symptoms induced by this form of stress. We hypothesized that chronic social defeat stress alters synaptic strength or connectivity of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc to induce social avoidance. To test this, we analyzed the synaptic profile of MSNs via confocal imaging of Lucifer-yellow-filled cells, ultrastructural analysis of the postsynaptic density, and electrophysiological recordings of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in mice after social defeat. We found that NAc MSNs have more stubby spine structures with smaller postsynaptic densities and an increase  in the frequency of mEPSCs after social defeat. In parallel to these structural changes, we observed significant increases in I\u03baB kinase (IKK) in the NAc after social defeat, a molecular pathway that has been shown to regulate neuronal morphology. Indeed, we find using viral-mediated gene transfer of dominant-negative and constitutively active IKK mutants that activation of IKK signaling pathways during social defeat is both necessary and sufficient to induce synaptic alterations and behavioral effects of the stress. These studies establish a causal role for IKK in regulating stress-induced adaptive plasticity  and may present a novel target for drug development in the treatment of mood and  anxiety disorders in humans.", "21543633": "Infusion of a \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist into the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) drives voracious food intake, an effect hypothesized to occur through increased tastant palatability. While intake of many palatable foods is elevated by MOR stimulation, this manipulation has a preferential effect on fatty food ingestion. Consumption of high-fat foods is increased by NAcc MOR stimulation even in rats that prefer a carbohydrate-rich alternative under baseline conditions. This suggests that NAcc MOR stimulation may not simply potentiate palatability signals and raises the possibility that mechanisms mediating fat intake may be distinct from those underlying intake of other tastants. The present study was conducted to investigate the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of NAcc MOR stimulation on fatty food intake. In experiment 1, we analyzed lick microstructure in rats ingesting Intralipid to identify the changes underlying feeding induced by infusion of a MOR-specific agonist into the NAcc. MOR stimulation in the NAcc core, but not shell, increased burst duration and first-minute licks, while simultaneously increasing the rate and duration of Intralipid ingestion. These results suggest that MOR activation in the core increases Intralipid palatability and attenuates inhibitory postingestive feedback. In experiment 2, we measured the effects of MOR stimulation in the NAcc core on consumption of nonnutritive olestra. A MOR-specific agonist dose dependently increased olestra intake, demonstrating that caloric signaling is not required for hyperphagia induced by NAcc MOR stimulation. Feeding induced by drug infusion in both experiments 1 and 2 was blocked by a MOR antagonist. In experiment 3, we determined whether MOR activation in the NAcc core could attenuate satiety-related signaling caused by infusion of the melanocortin agonist MTII into the third ventricle. Suppression of intake caused by MTII was reversed by MOR stimulation. Together, our results suggest that MOR stimulation in the NAcc core elevates fatty food intake through palatability mechanisms dependent on orosensory cues and suppression of satiety signals inhibiting food intake.", "20654704": "Overindulgence in easily available energy-dense palatable foods is thought to be  an important factor in the current obesity epidemic but the underlying neural mechanisms are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that mu-opioid receptor signaling in the nucleus accumbens may be important. Protracted suppression of endogenous mu-opioid receptor signaling focused on the nucleus accumbens shell for several days by means of microinjected beta-funaltrexamine (BFNA) diminished  both \"liking\" of sucrose, as indicated by fewer positive hedonic orofacial responses, and the incentive reinforcement value (\"wanting\") of a food reward, as indicated by lower completion speed and increased time being distracted in the incentive runway. BFNA-treatment also decreased responding to sucrose and corn oil in the brief access lick paradigm, a test measuring a combination of mainly taste-guided \"liking\" and low-effort \"wanting\", as well as 4 h intake of sucrose  solution. These effects were not due to nonspecific permanent neuronal changes, as they were fully reversible. We conclude that endogenous mu-opioid signaling in the nucleus accumbens is necessary for the full display of palatable food-induced hyperphagia through mechanisms including hedonic, motivational, and reinforcement processes. Development of obesity could be the result of predisposing innate differences in these mechanisms or overstimulation of these mechanisms by external factors.", "17049180": "Opioid signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) regulates feeding behavior, having particularly strong effects on consumption of highly palatable foods. Since macronutrient content may contribute to palatability, it is uncertain whether opioid regulation of food consumption is based primarily on its macronutrient content or its flavor per se. In order to isolate the effect of flavor, we manipulated opioid signaling in the NAcc in rats and quantified consumption of differently flavored but nutritionally identical pellets. When pellets of either flavor were presented alone, microinjection of d-Ala(2),N,Me-Phe(4),Gly-ol(5)-enkephalin (DAMGO (a mu opioid receptor (MOP) agonist)) into the NAcc increased consumption of pellets of both flavors equally. When both flavors of pellets were presented simultaneously, however, DAMGO in the NAcc selectively increased, while naltrexone (a non-selective opioid antagonist)  in the NAcc selectively decreased, consumption of the more preferred flavor. Systemic naltrexone injection had no flavor specific effects, decreasing consumption of both flavors equally. Non-selective inactivation of NAcc neurons by local microinjection of muscimol (a GABA(A) agonist) increased consumption of  both the more- and less-preferred flavors equally. These results indicate that opioid signaling directly regulates a subset of NAcc neurons that can selectively enhance consumption of preferred palatable foods based exclusively on flavor cues.", "16553624": "Acute pharmacological studies have implicated mu-opioid receptors (MORs) in the shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) in mediating responses for palatable food and other natural and drug-induced rewards. However, the long-term behavioral effects of inactivating signal transduction via accumbal MORs, as quantified by an anatomically defined loss of cellular activity, have never been analysed. We combined microinfusion of the irreversible MOR antagonist, beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA; 8.0 nmol/0.8 microL, n=9; controls, n=6) with mapping by [35S]GTPgammaS autoradiography to demonstrate an anatomically specific loss of the coupling of MORs to their G-proteins in the dorsal caudomedial shell of the NAC in rabbits. beta-FNA did not alter the stimulated coupling of kappa-opioid receptors. This selective blockade of the cellular function of MORs persistently  decreased consumption of a palatable sucrose solution by 40% during a daily 4-h test conducted 2, 3 and 4 days after infusion. beta-FNA did not alter body weight or 20-h consumption of standard chow or water. In 10 different rabbits, infusion  of the selective, competitive MOR antagonist, CTAP (D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2) into the same locus produced a reversible decrease in sucrose consumption, with normal intakes returning on the  next day. Together, these data appear to establish that MORs in this accumbal subregion support responding for orosensory reward. Overall, these results visualize a discrete brain locus where cellular actions of endogenous opioids mediate behaviors involved in self-administration of foods and perhaps other hedonically valued substances, such as ethanol and drugs of abuse.", "12684475": "Endogenous opioid peptides within the nucleus accumbens, a forebrain site critical for the regulation of reward-related behavior, are believed to play an important role in the control of appetite. In particular, this system is thought  to mediate the hedonic aspects of food intake, governing the positive emotional response to highly palatable food such as fat and sugar. Previous work has shown  that intra-accumbens administration of the mu-opioid agonist D-Ala2,Nme-Phe4,Glyol5-enkephalin (DAMGO) markedly increases food intake and preferentially enhances the intake of palatable foods such as fat, sucrose, and salt. Using information from recently performed c-fos mapping experiments, we sought to explore the involvement of structures efferent to the nucleus accumbens in this feeding response. Free-feeding rats with dual sets of bilateral cannulas  aimed at the nucleus accumbens and one of several output structures were infused  with DAMGO (0, 0.25 microg/0.5 microl) in the accumbens, and fat intake was measured over a 2 hr period. Concurrent temporary inactivation with the GABA(A) agonist muscimol (5-20 ng/0.25 microl) of the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, or the intermediate region of the nucleus of the solitary tract blocked the robust increase in fat intake induced by intra-accumbens DAMGO at doses of muscimol that did not affect general motor activity. Muscimol alone also inhibited and augmented baseline fat intake in the  lateral and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, respectively. These results suggest  that intake of energy-dense palatable food is controlled by activity in a neural  network linking ventral striatal opioids with diencephalic and brainstem structures.", "11823894": "RATIONALE: Endogenous opioids have been implicated in the hedonic evaluation of food and palatability. Opioids may also be involved in alcohol intake, as there is a positive correlation between alcohol drinking and preference for sweets and  fats. Our previous studies have shown that mu opioid stimulation of the nucleus accumbens preferentially augments intake of palatable food containing sucrose and fat. OBJECTIVE: The first goal of the present study was to further explore the nature  of the involvement of mu opioids within the nucleus accumbens in ingestive behavior by investigating the importance of orosensory reward in opioid-mediated  feeding, using non-caloric tasty substances (saccharin and salt). Second, we investigated whether mu opioid receptors within the nucleus accumbens also regulate alcohol consumption. METHODS: The mu agonist, D-Ala2, NMe-Phe4, Glyol5-enkephalin (DAMGO; 0, 0.025 and 0.25 microg/0.5 microl per side), was microinfused into the nucleus accumbens, and intake of 0.6% saline, 0.15% sodium saccharin, water, and 6% ethanol was measured. RESULTS: Microinfusion of DAMGO into the nucleus accumbens increased the drinking of salt and saccharin solutions in non-deprived rats. However, water intake was not increased by this treatment in water-deprived rats. Mu opioid stimulation of  the nucleus accumbens also augmented ethanol intake in rats not deprived of fluid, while leaving water intake unchanged when water was concurrently available. CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence to suggest that the mu opioid system within the ventral striatum regulates ingestive behavior via a mechanism related  to the hedonic assessment of taste. In addition, the nucleus accumbens may be a key brain area where ethanol interacts with endogenous opioid systems, and thus may be a common neural substrate for both food palatability and alcohol drinking.", "10938432": "Our previous studies have shown that stimulation of mu-opioid receptors within the nucleus accumbens preferentially enhances intake of palatable food containing sucrose and fat; thus, opioids in this brain area may mediate the rewarding characteristics of food by modulating taste and macronutrient preference. The present study was designed to further explore the nature of the involvement of striatal opioids in feeding behavior, such as the location of sensitive subregions of the ventral striatum and the brain neural circuits involved in opioid-mediated hyperphagia. In Experiment 1, we conducted a microinfusion mapping study of feeding behavior by microinfusion of the mu receptor agonist, D-Ala(2),NMe-Phe(4), Glyol(5)-enkephalin (0, 0.025 and 0.25 microg/0.5 microl per side; equivalent to 0, 0.04 and 0.40 nmol/0.5 microl per side), into several striatal subregions. In Experiment 2, detection of the expression of the immediate early gene, c-fos, was used to examine brain areas activated following  intra-striatal microinfusion of D-Ala(2), NMe-Phe(4),Glyol(5)-enkephalin. The microinjection mapping study demonstrated a broad anatomical gradient within the  striatum, with sensitivity highest in relatively more lateral and ventral regions of the striatum (ventrolateral striatum, lateral shell and core). The Fos mapping study demonstrated that circuitry including hypothalamic areas, the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra and the nucleus of the solitary tract was recruited by stimulation of mu receptors within the nucleus accumbens. A similar  pattern was observed following stimulation of mu receptors in the dorsal striatum; however, the extent of activation was much smaller in magnitude. These  results suggest that the role of mu receptors within the striatum in palatable feeding primarily involves ventral and lateral regions. Moreover, the pattern of  activation in hypothalamic, midbrain and gustatory-visceral relay areas suggests  that striatal mu receptors may participate in integrating motivational, metabolic and autonomic aspects of ingestive behavior.", "23907650": "RATIONALE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has achieved substantial success as a treatment for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The therapeutic efficacy and relative lack of serious side effects resulted in the expansion of DBS into the treatment of many other diseases, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette's, and depression, among others. More recently, a limited number of basic and clinical studies indicated that DBS may also be useful in the treatment of various addictions. OBJECTIVES: Here, we briefly summarize the history of DBS and review the basic and clinical studies focused on DBS and addiction. We also examine the potential  mechanisms that may underlie the effects of DBS. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The available data indicate that DBS is a promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of addiction. Thus far, the nucleus accumbens and subthalamic nucleus are the most promising sites for DBS, reversing aspects of addiction. The mechanisms underlying DBS are complex and likely vary from region to region. Emerging evidence indicates that DBS of the nucleus accumbens produces its effects, at least in part, by antidromic activation of cortico-accumbal afferents that stimulate inhibitory medial prefrontal cortex interneurons via recurrent collaterals.", "19386932": "Deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) region is an effective therapeutic avenue for several psychiatric disorders that are not responsive to traditional treatment strategies. Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which DBS achieves therapeutic effects remain unclear. We showed previously that high-frequency (HF) NAC DBS suppressed pyramidal cell firing and enhanced slow local field potential (LFP) oscillations in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) via antidromic activation of corticostriatal recurrent inhibition. Using simultaneous multisite LFP recordings in urethane-anesthetized rats, we now show that NAC DBS  delivered for 90 min at high or low frequency (LF) selectively affects spontaneous and evoked LFP oscillatory power and coherence within and between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), lateral OFC, mediodorsal thalamus (MD), and NAC. Compared with LF or sham DBS, HF DBS enhanced spontaneous slow oscillations and potentiated evoked LFP responses only in OFC. HF DBS also produced widespread increases in spontaneous beta and gamma power and enhanced coherent beta activity between MD and all other regions. In contrast, LF DBS elevated theta power in MD  and NAC. Analysis of acute NAC-induced oscillations showed that HF DBS increased  and LF DBS decreased induced relative gamma coherence compared with sham DBS. These data suggest that HF (therapeutic) and LF (possibly deleterious) NAC DBS produce distinct region-specific and frequency band-specific changes in LFP oscillations. NAC DBS may achieve therapeutic effects by enhancing rhythmicity and synchronous inhibition within and between afferent structures, thereby normalizing function of a neural circuit that shows aberrant activity in obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression.", "7623116": "The ventral striatum is considered an interface between limbic and motor systems. We followed the orbital and medial prefrontal circuit through the monkey basal ganglia by analyzing the projection from this cortical area to the ventral striatum and the representation of orbitofrontal cortex via the striatum, in the  globus pallidus and substantia nigra. Following injections of Lucifer yellow and  horse radish peroxidase into the medial ventral striatum, there is a very densely labeled distribution of cells in areas 13a and 13b, primarily in layers V and VI, and in medial prefrontal areas 32 and 25. Injections into the shell of the nucleus accumbens labeled primarily areas 25 and 32. The reaction product in the  globus pallidus and the substantia nigra supports previous studies demonstrating  that efferent projections from the ventral striatum are represented topographically in the ventral pallidum and nontopographically in the substantia  nigra, pars compacta. Tritiated amino acid or PHA-L tracer injections into orbitofrontal cortex produce dense patches of terminal labeling along the medial  edge of the caudate nucleus and the dorsal part of the nucleus accumbens. These results demonstrate that the orbital prefrontal cortex projects primarily to the  medial edge of the ventral striatum and to the core of the nucleus accumbens. The arrangement of terminals in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra show two different patterns. Thus, the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex is represented in a confined region of the globus pallidus but throughout an extensive area of the dorsal substantia nigra. Terminals are extensive throughout the region of the dopaminergic neurons, suggesting that this input may influence a wide area of both the striatum and frontal cortex.", "3085570": "Parallel organization of functionally segregated circuits linking basal ganglia and cortex.", "18753374": "Increasing evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS), which is currently being used as a therapy for neurological diseases, may be effective in  the treatment of psychiatric disorders as well. Here, we examined the influence of DBS of the nucleus accumbens shell on cocaine priming-induced reinstatement of drug seeking, an animal model of relapse. Rats were allowed to self-administer cocaine (0.25 mg, i.v.) 2 h daily for 21 d and then cocaine-seeking behavior was  extinguished by replacing cocaine with saline. During the reinstatement phase, DBS was administered bilaterally to the nucleus accumbens shell through bipolar stainless steel electrodes. Biphasic symmetrical pulses were delivered at a frequency of 160 Hz and a current intensity of 150 muA. DBS began immediately after a priming injection of cocaine (0, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) and continued  throughout each 2 h reinstatement session. Results indicated that only the higher doses of cocaine (10 and 20 mg/kg) produced robust and reliable reinstatement of  cocaine seeking. DBS of the nucleus accumbens shell significantly attenuated the  reinstatement of drug seeking precipitated by these higher cocaine doses. Additional experiments indicated that this DBS effect was both anatomically and reinforcer specific. Thus, DBS of the dorsal striatum had no influence on cocaine reinstatement and DBS of the accumbens shell did not affect the reinstatement of  food seeking.

To compare the roles of these subregions in reinstatement induced by cues associated with natural and drug rewards, the present study assessed the effects of inactivation of the NAc core and shell on cue-induced reinstatement of food-seeking behavior. Rats acquired a lever pressing response for food reward paired with a light/tone conditioned stimulus (CS). They were then subjected to extinction, where both food and the CS were withheld. Reinstatement of responding was measured during response-contingent presentations of the CS. Following saline infusions into the NAc core or shell, rats displayed a significant increase in lever pressing during reinstatement sessions. Inactivation of the core, induced by infusion of GABA agonists muscimol and baclofen, attenuated responding for the CS, but did not affect pavlovian approach toward the food receptacle. In contrast, inactivation of the shell had the opposite effect, potentiating responding relative to vehicle treatments. These data suggest that the NAc core and shell play opposing, yet complementary roles in mediating the influence that food-associated conditioned stimuli exert over behavior. The core enables reward-related stimuli to bias the direction and  vigor of instrumental responding. In contrast, the shell facilitates alterations  in behavior in response to changes in the incentive value of conditioned stimuli. The fact that the NAc core appears to play a similar role in cue-induced reinstatement induced by both natural and drug rewards suggests that this region  of the ventral striatum may be a final common pathway through which both drug- and food-associated stimuli may influence the direction and magnitude of ongoing  behavior.", "6798603": "Non-contingent \"priming\" drug injections and conditioned stimuli associated with  drug injections led to reinstatement of responding after a period of extinction.

Test drug injections or conditioned stimuli were presented during extinction and the latency to the first response and the total number of responses following the treatment were measured. Cocaine injections of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg restored responding during extinction, regardless of the duration of the extinction period (between 10 min and 180 min) since drug self-administration. Amphetamine, apomorphine, and morphine but not ethanol, heroin, or methohexital reinstated previously cocaine-reinforced responding. Amphetamine, cocaine, and morphine did not increase responding in animals trained to bar press only for food reinforcement,  suggesting that the reinstatement effect is specific to drug-reinforced responses. The statement effect is specific to drug-reinforced responses.

It has been suggested that stress  and exposure to priming doses of alcohol and to alcohol-associated stimuli (cues) contribute to the relapse risk after detoxification. This article focuses on neuronal correlates of cue responses in detoxified alcoholics. Current brain imaging studies indicate that dysfunction of dopaminergic, glutamatergic and opioidergic neurotransmission in the brain reward system (ventral striatum including the nucleus accumbens) can be associated with alcohol craving and functional brain activation in neuronal systems that process attentional relevant stimuli, reward expectancy and experience. Increased functional brain activation  elicited by such alcohol-associated cues predicted an increased relapse risk, whereas high brain activity elicited by affectively positive stimuli may represent a protective factor and was correlated with a decreased prospective relapse risk. These findings are discussed with respect to psychotherapeutic and  pharmacological treatment options.", "16099045": "In this review we will critically assess the hypothesis that the reinforcing effect of virtually all drugs of abuse is primarily dependent on activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. The focus is on five classes of abused drugs: psychostimulants, opiates, ethanol, cannabinoids and nicotine. For each of these  drug classes, the pharmacological and physiological mechanisms underlying the direct or indirect influence on mesolimbic dopamine transmission will be reviewed. Next, we evaluate behavioral pharmacological experiments that specifically assess the influence of activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system on drug reinforcement, with particular emphasis on animal experiments using drug  self-administration paradigms. There is overwhelming evidence that all five classes of abused drugs increase dopamine transmission in limbic regions of the brain through interactions with a variety of transporters, ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors. Behavioral pharmacological experiments indicate that  increased dopamine transmission is clearly both necessary and sufficient to promote psychostimulant reinforcement. For the other four classes of abused substances, self-administration experiments suggest that although increasing mesolimbic dopamine transmission plays an important role in the reinforcing effects of opiates, ethanol, cannabinoids and nicotine, there are also dopamine-independent processes that contribute significantly to the reinforcing effects of these compounds.", "23628212": "Recent breakthroughs in optogenetic technologies to alter neuronal firing and function with light, combined with cell type-specific transgenic animal lines, has led to important insights into the function of distinct neuronal cell subtypes and afferent connections in the heterogeneously complex striatum. A vital part of the basal ganglia, the striatum is heavily implicated in both motor control and motivation-based behavior; as well as in neurological disorders and psychiatric diseases including Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, drug addiction, depression, and schizophrenia. Researchers are able to manipulate firing and cell signaling with temporal precision using optogenetics in the two striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) subpopulations, the striatal interneurons, and striatal afferents. These studies confirmed the classical hypothesis of movement  control and reward seeking behavior through direct versus indirect pathway MSNs;  illuminated a selective role for TANs in cocaine reward; dissected the roles of glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs to striatum in reward; and highlighted a role for striatal signaling molecules including an adrenergic G-protein coupled receptor in reward and the rho-GTPase Rac1 in cocaine reward and cocaine induced  structural plasticity. This review focuses on how the evolving optogenetic toolbox provides insight into the distinct behavioral roles of striatal cell subpopulations and striatal afferents, which has clinically relevant implications into neurological disorders and psychiatric disease.", "21270784": "Over the last decade and a half, reinforcement learning models have fostered an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the functions of dopamine and cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical (CBGTC) circuits. More recently, these models, and the insights that they afford, have started to be used to understand  important aspects of several psychiatric and neurological disorders that involve  disturbances of the dopaminergic system and CBGTC circuits. We review this approach and its existing and potential applications to Parkinson's disease, Tourette's syndrome, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, addiction, schizophrenia and preclinical animal models used to screen new antipsychotic drugs. The approach's proven explanatory and predictive power bodes well for the  continued growth of computational psychiatry and computational neurology.", "18923511": "Unravelling the pathophysiology of depression is a unique challenge. Not only are depressive syndromes heterogeneous and their aetiologies diverse, but symptoms such as guilt and suicidality are impossible to reproduce in animal models. Nevertheless, other symptoms have been accurately modelled, and these, together with clinical data, are providing insight into the neurobiology of depression. Recent studies combining behavioural, molecular and electrophysiological techniques reveal that certain aspects of depression result from maladaptive stress-induced neuroplastic changes in specific neural circuits. They also show that understanding the mechanisms of resilience to stress offers a crucial new dimension for the development of fundamentally novel antidepressant treatments.", "15564575": "Acute and chronic stress differentially regulate immediate-early gene (IEG) expression in the brain. Although acute stress induces c-Fos and FosB, repeated exposure to stress desensitizes the c-Fos response, but FosB-like immunoreactivity remains high. Several other treatments differentially regulate IEG expression in a similar manner after acute versus chronic exposure. The form  of FosB that persists after these chronic treatments has been identified as DeltaFosB, a splice variant of the fosB gene. This study was designed to determine whether the FosB form induced after chronic stress is also DeltaFosB and to map the brain regions and identify the cell populations that exhibit this  effect. Western blotting, using an antibody that recognizes all Fos family members, revealed that acute restraint stress caused robust induction of c-Fos and full-length FosB, as well as a small induction of DeltaFosB, in the frontal cortex (fCTX) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). The induction of c-Fos (and to some extent full-length FosB) was desensitized after 10 d of restraint stress, at which point levels of DeltaFosB were high. A similar pattern was observed after chronic unpredictable stress. By use of immunohistochemistry, we found that chronic restraint stress induced DeltaFosB expression predominantly in the fCTX,  NAc, and basolateral amygdala, with lower levels of induction seen elsewhere. These findings establish that chronic stress induces DeltaFosB in several discrete regions of the brain. Such induction could contribute to the long-term effects of stress on the brain.", "25057203": "Maladaptive memories elicited by exposure to environmental stimuli associated with drugs of abuse are often responsible for relapse among addicts. Interference with the reconsolidation of drug memory can inhibit drug seeking. Previous studies have indicated that the dephosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 \u03b1-subunit (eIF2\u03b1) plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and long-term memory consolidation, but its role in the reconsolidation of drug memory remains unknown. The amygdala is required for the reconsolidation of a destabilized drug memory after retrieval of drug-paired stimuli. Here, we used conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration procedures to determine whether amygdala eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation is required for the reconsolidation of morphine and cocaine memories in rats. We found that the levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Ser51) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) were decreased after reexposure to a previously morphine- or cocaine-paired context (i.e., a memory retrieval procedure) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) but not in the central amygdala. Intra-BLA infusions of Sal003, a  selective inhibitor of eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, immediately after memory retrieval disrupted the reconsolidation of morphine- or cocaine-induced CPP, leading to a long-lasting suppression of drug-paired stimulus-induced craving. Advanced knockdown of ATF4 expression in the BLA by lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA blocked the disruption of the reconsolidation of morphine-induced CPP induced by Sal003 treatment. Furthermore, inhibition of eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation in the BLA immediately after light/tone stimulus retrieval decreased subsequent cue-induced heroin-seeking behavior in the self-administration procedure. These results demonstrate that eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation in the BLA mediates the memory reconsolidation of drug-paired stimuli.", "24698092": "Time-dependent increases in cue-induced nicotine and methamphetamine craving during abstinence were recently reported in human drug-dependent individuals. In  the present study, we sought to determine whether this 'incubation of craving' phenomenon also occurs in alcoholics. Four groups of 80 inpatient adult male alcoholics were assessed in a single session (between-group design) for cue-induced alcohol craving at 7, 14, 30 and 60 days of abstinence. Another group that included 19 patients was repeatedly tested for cue-induced alcohol craving at the same abstinence days as above. Other psychological and physiological measures were assessed at the four abstinence timepoints. Cue-induced alcohol craving measured with visual analogue scales was the highest at 60 days of abstinence both between and within groups. However, heart rate, blood pressure and skin conductance responses did not differ between abstinent groups. These results provide evidence of the incubation of alcohol craving in humans, extending previous reports with smokers and methamphetamine addicts.", "24666346": "The mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) is a serine and threonine kinase that regulates cell growth, survival, and proliferation. mTORC1 is a master controller of the translation of a subset of mRNAs. In the central nervous system mTORC1 plays a crucial role in mechanisms underlying learning and memory by controlling synaptic protein synthesis. Here, we review recent evidence suggesting that the mTORC1 signaling pathway promotes neuroadaptations following exposure to a diverse group of drugs of abuse including stimulants, cannabinoids, opiates, and alcohol. We further describe potential molecular mechanisms by which drug-induced mTORC1 activation may alter  brain functions. Finally, we propose that mTORC1 is a focal point shared by drugs of abuse to mediate drug-related behaviors such as reward seeking and excessive drug intake, and offer future directions to decipher the contribution of the kinase to mechanisms underlying addiction. Recent studies suggesting that exposure to diverse classes of drugs of abuse as well as exposure to drug-associated memories lead to mTORC1 kinase activation in the limbic system. In turn, mTORC1 controls the onset and the maintenance of pathological neuroadaptions that underlie several features of drug addiction such as drug seeking and relapse. Therefore, we propose that targeting mTORC1 and its effectors is a promising strategy to treat drug disorders.", "24595501": "RATIONAL: Memories return to a labile state following their retrieval and must undergo a process of reconsolidation to be maintained. Thus, disruption of cocaine reward memories by interference with reconsolidation may be therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of cocaine addiction. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to elucidate the signaling pathway involved in reconsolidation of cocaine reward memory and to test whether targeting this pathway could disrupt cocaine-associated contextual memory. METHODS: Using a mouse model of conditioned place preference, regulation of the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), mammalian target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), P70S6K, \u03b2-catenin, and the upstream signaling molecule Akt, was studied in cortico-limbic-striatal circuitry after re-exposure to an environment previously paired with cocaine. RESULT: Levels of phosporylated Akt-Thr308, GSK3\u03b1-Ser21, GSK3\u03b2-Ser9, mTORC1, and  P70S6K were reduced in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus 10 min after the reactivation of cocaine cue memories. Levels of pAkt and pGSK3 were also reduced  in the prefrontal cortex. Since reduced phosphorylation of GSK3 indicates heightened enzyme activity, the effect of a selective GSK3 inhibitor, SB216763, on reconsolidation was tested. Administration of SB216763 immediately after exposure to an environment previously paired with cocaine abrogated a previously  established place preference, suggesting that GSK3 inhibition interfered with reconsolidation of cocaine-associated reward memories. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the Akt/GSK3/mTORC1 signaling pathway in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and/or prefrontal cortex is critically involved in the reconsolidation of cocaine contextual reward memory. Inhibition of GSK3 activity during memory retrieval can erase an established cocaine place preference.", "23894345": "RATIONALE: The majority of drug abusers are incapable of sustaining abstinence over any length of time. Accumulating evidence has linked intense and involuntary craving, Impulsive decision-making and mood disturbances to risk for relapse. However, little is known about temporal changes of these neuropsychological functions in methamphetamine (METH)-dependent individuals. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of length of abstinence on decision-making, craving (baseline and cue-induced), and emotional state in METH-addicted individuals. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 183 adult METH-dependent patients at an addiction rehabilitation center who were abstinent for 6 days (n\u200a=\u200a37), 14 days (n\u200a=\u200a33), 1 month (n\u200a=\u200a31), 3 months (n\u200a=\u200a30), 6 months (n\u200a=\u200a26), or 1 year (n\u200a=\u200a30) and 39 healthy subjects were administered the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to assess decision-making performance. Depression, anxiety, and impulsivity were  also examined. One hundred thirty-nine METH abusers who were abstinent for the aforementioned times then underwent a cue session, and subjective and physiological measures were assessed. RESULTS: METH dependent individuals who were abstinent for longer periods of time exhibited better decision-making than those who were abstinent for shorter periods of time. And self-reported emotional symptoms improved with abstinence. METH abusers' ratings of craving decreased with the duration of abstinence, while cue-induced craving increased until 3 months of abstinence and decreased at 6 months and 1 year of abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: We present time-dependent alterations in decision-making, emotional  state, and the incubation of cue-induced craving in METH-dependent individuals, which might have significant clinical implications for the prevention of relapse.", "21677641": "Clinical studies consistently demonstrate that a single sub-psychomimetic dose of ketamine, an ionotropic glutamatergic NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor) antagonist, produces fast-acting antidepressant responses in patients suffering from major depressive disorder, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Depressed patients report the alleviation of major depressive disorder symptoms within two hours of a single, low-dose intravenous infusion of ketamine, with effects lasting up to two weeks, unlike traditional antidepressants (serotonin re-uptake inhibitors), which take weeks to reach efficacy. This delay is a major  drawback to current therapies for major depressive disorder and faster-acting antidepressants are needed, particularly for suicide-risk patients. The ability of ketamine to produce rapidly acting, long-lasting antidepressant responses in depressed patients provides a unique opportunity to investigate underlying cellular mechanisms. Here we show that ketamine and other NMDAR antagonists produce fast-acting behavioural antidepressant-like effects in mouse models, and  that these effects depend on the rapid synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. We find that the ketamine-mediated blockade of NMDAR at rest deactivates  eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) kinase (also called CaMKIII), resulting in  reduced eEF2 phosphorylation and de-suppression of translation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Furthermore, we find that inhibitors of eEF2 kinase induce fast-acting behavioural antidepressant-like effects. Our findings indicate that the regulation of protein synthesis by spontaneous neurotransmission may serve as a viable therapeutic target for the development of fast-acting antidepressants.", "20817135": "BACKGROUND: Abstinent drug users remain at risk for relapse long after withdrawal subsides. Animal studies indicate that responses to drug-related cues not only persist but increase with abstinence, a phenomenon termed \"incubation of drug craving.\" It is unknown whether cue-induced craving increases, decreases, or remains constant with abstinence in humans. We investigated effects of abstinence on cue-induced craving in cigarette smokers. METHODS: Eighty-six non-treatment-seeking, adult smokers (\u226510 cigarettes daily) were paid to abstain for 7 (Group 1), 14 (Group 2), or 35 (Groups 3 and 4) days.  Abstinence was verified daily. Groups 1, 2, and 3 underwent a single cue session  on the final abstinence day (7, 14, or 35). Group 4 viewed cues on Days 7, 14, and 35. RESULTS: Between and within groups, smoking-cue-induced craving increased with abstinence on some measures. Cue-induced craving was greater in Group 3 (35-day)  compared with Group 1 (7-day). Within Group 4, cue-induced craving was greater at 35 than 14 days. Cue-induced craving did not decrease with abstinence on any measure. CONCLUSIONS: We present initial evidence of incubation of cue-induced craving in  humans. The observation that cue-induced craving increases with abstinence, even  as \"background\" craving and withdrawal symptoms subside, might have treatment implications.", "19630748": "Understanding and preventing relapse to drug use is one of the most difficult challenges faced by clinicians and practitioners in the struggle to help people remain abstinent. In this paper, we review basic preclinical research on forced abstinence periods that identify the neural substrates involved and neural adaptations that occur after a drug-free period. Our attention focuses on forced  abstinence after self-administration because of its promise for translational research in the development of candidate medications to reduce relapse. This model requires subjects (often rats) to initially acquire drug self-administration. However, rather than extinguishing behavior with daily drug-free sessions as in the reinstatement model of drug seeking, subjects are removed from the self-administration situation and do not receive any exposure to the drug. Notably, the integrity of the drug-taking behavior and the drug-associated cues in the drug-taking environment are preserved because they are not experienced in the absence of the drug. Research shows time dependent increases in drug-seeking following forced abstinence periods. More so, neural substrates and adaptations within the mesocorticolimbic system and the nigrostriatal system have been identified that contribute to increased drug seeking following abstinence. From a translational perspective, behavioral and pharmacological treatment of substance use disorder often starts during this initial abstinence period (either forced or voluntary). The forced abstinence model simulates some of the features of this treatment situation and thus allows  for the study of potential treatments that alter relapse of drug-seeking behaviors along with the accompanying neurobiological changes.", "27993521": "AMPA receptor (AMPAR) transmission onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the adult  rat nucleus accumbens (NAc) is normally dominated by GluA2-containing, Ca2+-impermeable AMPAR (CI-AMPARs). However, GluA2-lacking, Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) accumulate after prolonged withdrawal from extended-access  cocaine self-administration and thereafter their activation is required for the intensified (incubated) cue-induced cocaine craving that characterizes prolonged  withdrawal from such regimens. These findings suggest the existence of mechanisms in NAc MSNs that differentially regulate CI-AMPARs and CP-AMPARs. Here, we compared trafficking of GluA1A2 CI-AMPARs and homomeric GluA1 CP-AMPARs using immunocytochemical assays in cultured NAc MSNs plated with prefrontal cortical neurons to restore excitatory inputs. We began by evaluating constitutive internalization of surface receptors and found that this occurs more rapidly for  CP-AMPARs. Next, we studied receptor insertion into the membrane; combined with past results, the present findings suggest that activation of protein kinase A accelerates insertion of both CP-AMPARs and CI-AMPARs. We also studied constitutive cycling (net loss of receptors from the membrane under conditions where internalization and recycling are both occurring). Interestingly, although  CP-AMPARs exhibit faster constitutive internalization, they cycle at similar rates as CI-AMPARs, suggesting faster reinsertion of CP-AMPARs. In studies of synaptic scaling, long-term (24\u00a0h) activity blockade increased surface expression and cycling rates of CI-AMPARs but not CP-AMPARs, whereas long-term increases in  activity produced more pronounced scaling down of CI-AMPARs than CP-AMPARs but did not alter receptor cycling. These findings can be used to evaluate and generate hypotheses regarding AMPAR plasticity in the rat NAc following cocaine exposure.", "27603142": "Importance: A common trigger for relapse in drug addiction is the experience of craving via exposure to cues previously associated with drug use. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated incubation of cue-induced drug-seeking during the initial phase of abstinence, followed by a decline over time. In humans, the incubation effect has been shown for alcohol, nicotine, and methamphetamine addictions, but not for heroin or cocaine addiction. Understanding the trajectory of cue-induced craving during abstinence in humans is of importance for addiction medicine. Objective: To assess cue-induced craving for cocaine in humans using both subjective and objective indices of cue-elicited responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: Seventy-six individuals addicted to cocaine with varying durations of abstinence (ie, 2 days, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and  1 year) participated in this laboratory-based cross-sectional study from June 19, 2007, to November 26, 2012. The late positive potential component of electroencephalography, a recognized marker of incentive salience, was used to track motivated attention to drug cues across these self-selected groups. Participants also completed subjective ratings of craving for cocaine before presentation of a cue, and ratings of cocaine \"liking\" (hedonic feelings toward cocaine) and \"wanting\" (craving for cocaine) after presentation of cocaine-related pictures. Data analysis was conducted from June 5, 2015, to March 30, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures: The late positive potential amplitudes and ratings of liking and wanting cocaine in response to cocaine-related pictures were quantified and compared across groups. Results: Among the 76 individuals addicted to cocaine, 19 (25%) were abstinent for 2 days, 20 (26%) were abstinent for 1 week, 15 (20%) were abstinent for 1 month, 12 (16%) were abstinent for 6 months, and 10 (13%) were abstinent for 1 year. In response to drug cues, the mean (SD) late positive potential amplitudes  showed a parabolic trajectory that was higher at 1 (1.26 [1.36] \u00b5V) and 6 (1.17 [1.19] \u00b5V) months of abstinence and lower at 2 days (0.17 [1.09] \u00b5V), 1 week (0.36 [1.26] \u00b5V), and 1 year (-0.27 [1.74] \u00b5V) of abstinence (P\u2009=\u2009.02, partial \u03b72\u2009=\u20090.16). In contrast, the subjective assessment of baseline craving (mean [SD] rating: 2 days, 26.05 [9.85]; 1 week, 18.70 [11.01]; 1 month, 10.87 [10.70]; 6 months, 6.92 [8.47]; and 1 year, 3.00 [3.77]) and cue-induced liking (mean [SD] rating: 2 days, 3.06 [2.34]; 1 week, 2.33 [2.87]; 1 month, 1.15 [2.03]; 6 months, 1.00 [2.24]; and 1 year, 1.00 [1.26]) and wanting (mean [SD] rating: 2 days, 3.44 [2.62]; 1 week, 2.72 [2.87]; 1 month, 1.46 [2.33]; 6 months, 1.00 [2.16]; and 1 year, 1.00 [1.55]) of cocaine showed a linear decline from 2 days to 1 year of abstinence (P\u2009\u2264\u2009.001, partial \u03b72\u2009>\u20090.26). Conclusions and Relevance: The late positive potential responses to drug cues, indicative of motivated attention, showed a trajectory similar to that reported in animal models. In contrast, we did not detect incubation of subjective cue-induced craving. Thus, the objective electroencephalographic measure may possibly be a better indicator of vulnerability to cue-induced relapse than subjective reports of craving, although this hypothesis must be empirically tested. These results suggest the importance of deploying intervention between 1  month and 6 months of abstinence, when addicted individuals may be most vulnerable to, and perhaps least cognizant of, risk of relapse.", "15071719": "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: We previously found time dependent increases, or incubation, of cocaine seeking induced by re-exposure to cocaine cues over withdrawal periods of up to 3 months. Here, we studied cocaine seeking induced by re-exposure to cocaine cues or cocaine itself over an extended withdrawal period  of 6 months. METHODS: Rats were trained to self-administer intravenous cocaine for 6 h/day for 10 days. Cocaine seeking induced by re-exposure to cocaine cues or cocaine itself, as measured in extinction or drug-induced reinstatement tests, respectively, was then assessed 1 day, or 1, 3 or 6 months after withdrawal. Rats were first given six 1-h extinction sessions wherein lever presses resulted in contingent presentations of cues previously paired with cocaine infusions. Subsequently, reinstatement of drug seeking induced by cocaine injections (expt 1: 0, 5, and 15 mg/kg, i.p.; expt 2: 0, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg) was assessed during three 1-h sessions. RESULTS: Profound time dependent changes in responsiveness to cocaine cues in the extinction tests were observed, with low responding after 1 day, high responding  after 1 and 3 months, and intermediate responding after 6 months of withdrawal. In contrast, no significant time dependent changes in cocaine-induced drug seeking were found; acute re-exposure to cocaine effectively reinstated responding at all withdrawal periods. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that the withdrawal period is a critical modulator  of drug seeking provoked by re-exposure to cocaine cues, but not cocaine itself.  Results also indicate that while the incubation of responsiveness to cocaine cues is a long lasting phenomenon, it is not permanent.", "19046384": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of cocaine on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Utilizing single-unit recordings in vivo, microelectrophoretic administration of DA enhanced the firing rate of VTA GABA neurons via D2/D3 DA receptor activation. Lower doses of intravenous cocaine (0.25-0.5 mg/kg), or the  DA transporter (DAT) blocker methamphetamine, enhanced VTA GABA neuron firing rate via D2/D3 receptor activation. Higher doses of cocaine (1.0-2.0 mg/kg) inhibited their firing rate, which was not sensitive to the D2/D3 antagonist eticlopride. The voltage-sensitive sodium channel (VSSC) blocker lidocaine inhibited the firing rate of VTA GABA neurons at all doses tested (0.25-2.0 mg/kg). Cocaine or lidocaine reduced VTA GABA neuron spike discharges induced by  stimulation of the internal capsule (ICPSDs) at dose levels 0.25-2 mg/kg (IC(50)  1.2 mg/kg). There was no effect of DA or methamphetamine on ICPSDs, or of DA antagonists on cocaine inhibition of ICPSDs. In VTA GABA neurons in vitro, cocaine reduced (IC(50) 13 microm) current-evoked spikes and TTX-sensitive sodium currents in a use-dependent manner. In VTA DA neurons, cocaine reduced IPSCs (IC(50) 13 microm), increased IPSC paired-pulse facilitation and decreased spontaneous IPSC frequency, without affecting miniature IPSC frequency or amplitude. These findings suggest that cocaine acts on GABA neurons to reduce activity-dependent GABA release on DA neurons in the VTA, and that cocaine's use-dependent blockade of VTA GABA neuron VSSCs may synergize with its DAT inhibiting properties to enhance mesolimbic DA transmission implicated in cocaine reinforcement.", "12880848": "Analysis and interpretation of functional MRI (fMRI) data have traditionally been based on identifying areas of significance on a thresholded statistical map of the entire imaged brain volume. This form of analysis can be likened to a \"fishing expedition.\" As we become more knowledgeable about the structure-function relationships of different brain regions, tools for a priori hypothesis testing are needed. These tools must be able to generate region of interest masks for a priori hypothesis testing consistently and with minimal effort. Current tools that generate region of interest masks required for a priori hypothesis testing can be time-consuming and are often laboratory specific. In this paper we demonstrate a method of hypothesis-driven data analysis using an automated atlas-based masking technique. We provide a powerful  method of probing fMRI data using automatically generated masks based on lobar anatomy, cortical and subcortical anatomy, and Brodmann areas. Hemisphere, lobar, anatomic label, tissue type, and Brodmann area atlases were generated in MNI space based on the Talairach Daemon. Additionally, we interfaced these multivolume atlases to a widely used fMRI software package, SPM99, and demonstrate the use of the atlas tool with representative fMRI data. This tool represents a necessary evolution in fMRI data analysis for testing of more spatially complex hypotheses.", "6151418": "Extracellular single unit recordings were obtained from neurones in the nucleus accumbens of urethane anaesthetized rats. Single pulse stimulation (300-800 microA, 0.15 ms, 0.5-1.5 Hz) of the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus strongly excited silent and spontaneously active (3-6 spikes/s) medial accumbens neurones. The majority of neurones excited by hippocampal stimulation were quiescent and identified only by the elicited action potentials. Neurones on the dorso-medial border of the nucleus accumbens and adjacent lateral septum, with a faster spontaneous discharge rate (8-12 spikes/s), were inhibited by hippocampal stimulation. In the ventral border of the accumbens and the olfactory tubercle, hippocampal stimulation also inhibited the fast-firing (greater than 20 spikes/s) neurones. When trains of 10 conditioning pulses (300-800 microA, 0.15 ms, 10 Hz)  were delivered to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) 100 ms before each single-pulse stimulation of the hippocampus, the excitatory responses of the silent and spontaneously active accumbens neurones were attenuated. The possibility of this relatively prolonged attenuation effect being dopamine-mediated was supported by several lines of evidence. Dopamine, applied iontophoretically, reduced markedly the excitatory response of accumbens neurones to hippocampal stimulation. Iontophoretically applied dopamine mimicked the attenuating effect produced by VTA conditioning stimulation in the same neurone.  The attenuating effects of VTA conditioning stimulation on the activation of accumbens neurones by hippocampal stimulation was reduced by: (1) administration  of 6-hydroxydopamine to the VTA 2 days and 7-9 days prior to the recording session, (2) the intraperitoneal injection of haloperidol 1 h before the recording session, and (3) the iontophoretic application of trifluoperazine to accumbens neurones. These observations support the hypothesis that the attenuating effects of the mesolimbic dopamine system on limbic inputs to the nucleus accumbens may have a role in limbic-motor integration.", "15056714": "Repeated exposure to cocaine can induce neuroadaptations in the brain. One mechanism by which persistent changes occur involves alterations in gene expression mediated by the dopamine receptors. Both the dopamine D1 and D3 receptors have been shown to mediate gene expression changes. Moreover, the D1 and D3 receptors are also coexpressed in the same neurons, particularly in the nucleus accumbens and also caudoputamen (CPu). Little is known however, whether these two receptors coordinately regulate gene expression after cocaine administration and the underlying mechanisms. We have used various gene mutant mice to address this issue. We show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and c-fos induction in the CPu in response to acute cocaine administration is mediated by the D1 receptor and inhibited by the D3 receptor. Moreover, ERK activation mediates acute cocaine-induced expression of Fos family  genes, including c-fos, fosB and fra2. Interestingly, dynorphin, neogenin, and synaptotagmin VII, genes that possess cAMP-response element binding protein and AP-1 transcription complex-binding consensus sequences in their promoters, are also oppositely regulated by the D1 and D3 receptors after repeated exposure to cocaine. Furthermore, such regulation depends on proper ERK activation and c-fos  function. These results suggest that the D1 and D3 receptors elicit opposite regulation of target gene expression by regulating ERK activation and c-fos induction after acute and chronic cocaine treatment.", "9871940": "This review gives an overview of recent findings and developments in research on  brain mechanisms of reward and reinforcement from studies using the place preference conditioning paradigm, with emphasis on those studies that have been published within the last decade. Methodological issues of the paradigm (such as  design of the conditioning apparatus, biased vs unbiased conditioning, state dependency effects) are discussed. Results from studies using systemic and local  (intracranial) drug administration, natural reinforcers, and non-drug treatments  and from studies examining the effects of lesions are presented. Papers reporting on conditioned place aversion (CPA) experiments are also included. A special emphasis is put on the issue of tolerance and sensitization to the rewarding properties of drugs. Transmitter systems that have been investigated with respect to their involvement in brain reward mechanisms include dopamine, opioids, acetylcholine, GABA, serotonin, glutamate, substance P, and cholecystokinin, the  motivational significance of which has been examined either directly, by using respective agonist or antagonist drugs, or indirectly, by studying the effects of these drugs on the reward induced by other drugs. For a number of these transmitters, detailed studies have been conducted to delineate the receptor subtype(s) responsible for the mediation of the observed drug effects, particularly in the case of dopamine, the opioids, serotonin and glutamate. Brain sites that have been implicated in the mediation of drug-induced place conditioning include the 'traditional' brain reward sites, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens, but the medial prefrontal cortex, ventral pallidum, amygdala and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus have also been shown to play  important roles in the mediation of place conditioning induced by drugs or natural reinforcers. Thus, although the paradigm has also been criticized because of some inherent methodological problems, it is clear that during the past decade place preference conditioning has become a valuable and firmly established and very widely used tool in behavioural pharmacology and addiction research.", "23325250": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) contributes to diverse types of plasticity, including cocaine addiction. We investigated the role of BDNF in the  rat nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the incubation of cocaine craving over 3 months of withdrawal from extended access cocaine self-administration. First, we confirmed  by immunoblotting that BDNF levels are elevated after this cocaine regimen on withdrawal day 45 (WD45) and showed that BDNF mRNA levels are not altered. Next,  we explored the time course of elevated BDNF expression using immunohistochemistry. Elevation of BDNF in the NAc core was detected on WD45 and  further increased on WD90, whereas elevation in shell was not detected until WD90. Surface expression of activated tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) was also enhanced on WD90. Next, we used viral vectors to attenuate BDNF-TrkB signaling. Virus injection into the NAc core enhanced cue-induced cocaine seeking on WD1 compared with controls, whereas no effect was observed on WD30 or WD90. Attenuating BDNF-TrkB signaling in shell did not affect cocaine seeking on WD1 or WD45 but significantly decreased cocaine seeking on WD90. These results suggest that basal levels of BDNF transmission in the NAc core exert a suppressive effect on cocaine seeking in early withdrawal (WD1), whereas the late elevation of BDNF  protein in NAc shell contributes to incubation in late withdrawal (WD90). Finally, BDNF protein levels in the NAc were significantly increased after ampakine treatment, supporting the novel hypothesis that the gradual increase of  BDNF levels in NAc accompanying incubation could be caused by increased AMPAR transmission during withdrawal.", "22090502": "We investigated the properties of neostriatal neuropeptide Y (NPY)-expressing interneurons in transgenic GFP (green fluorescent protein)-NPY reporter mice. In  vitro whole-cell recordings and biocytin staining demonstrated the existence of a novel class of neostriatal NPY-expressing GABAergic interneurons that exhibit electrophysiological, neurochemical, and morphological properties strikingly different from those of previously described NPY-containing, plateau-depolarization low-threshold spike (NPY-PLTS) interneurons. The novel NPY interneuron type (NPY-neurogliaform) differed from previously described NPY-PLTS  interneurons by exhibiting a significantly lower input resistance and hyperpolarized membrane potential, regular, nonaccommodating spiking in response  to depolarizing current injections, and an absence of plateau depolarizations or  low-threshold spikes. NPY-neurogliaform interneurons were also easily distinguished morphologically by their dense, compact, and highly branched dendritic and local axonal arborizations that contrasted sharply with the sparse  and extended axonal and dendritic arborizations of NPY-PLTS interneurons. Furthermore, NPY-neurogliaform interneurons did not express immunofluorescence for somatostatin or nitric oxide synthase that was ubiquitous in NPY-PLTS interneurons. IPSP/Cs could only rarely be elicited in spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in paired recordings with NPY-PLTS interneurons. In contrast, the probability of SPN innervation by NPY-neurogliaform interneurons was extremely high, the synapse very reliable (no failures were observed), and the resulting postsynaptic response was a slow, GABA(A) receptor-mediated IPSC that has not been previously described in striatum but that has been elicited from NPY-GABAergic neurogliaform interneurons in cortex and hippocampus. These properties suggest unique and distinctive roles for NPY-PLTS and NPY-neurogliaform interneurons in the integrative properties of the neostriatum.", "27357796": "Maladaptive aggressive behaviour is associated with a number of neuropsychiatric  disorders and is thought to result partly from the inappropriate activation of brain reward systems in response to aggressive or violent social stimuli. Nuclei  within the ventromedial hypothalamus, extended amygdala and limbic circuits are known to encode initiation of aggression; however, little is known about the neural mechanisms that directly modulate the motivational component of aggressive behaviour. Here we established a mouse model to measure the valence of aggressive inter-male social interaction with a smaller subordinate intruder as reinforcement for the development of conditioned place preference (CPP). Aggressors develop a CPP, whereas non-aggressors develop a conditioned place aversion to the intruder-paired context. Furthermore, we identify a functional GABAergic projection from the basal forebrain (BF) to the lateral habenula (lHb)  that bi-directionally controls the valence of aggressive interactions. Circuit-specific silencing of GABAergic BF-lHb terminals of aggressors with halorhodopsin (NpHR3.0) increases lHb neuronal firing and abolishes CPP to the intruder-paired context. Activation of GABAergic BF-lHb terminals of non-aggressors with channelrhodopsin (ChR2) decreases lHb neuronal firing and promotes CPP to the intruder-paired context. Finally, we show that altering inhibitory transmission at BF-lHb terminals does not control the initiation of aggressive behaviour. These results demonstrate that the BF-lHb circuit has a critical role in regulating the valence of inter-male aggressive behaviour and provide novel mechanistic insight into the neural circuits modulating aggression  reward processing.", "25446562": "\u0394FosB is a member of the Fos family of transcription factors. While other family  members are induced rapidly but transiently in response to a host of acute stimuli, \u0394FosB is unique in that it accumulates in response to repeated stimulation due to its unusual protein stability. Such prolonged induction of \u0394FosB, within nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region, has been most studied in animal models of drug addiction, with considerable evidence indicating that \u0394FosB promotes reward and motivation and serves as a mechanism of drug sensitization and increased drug self-administration. In more recent years, prolonged induction of \u2206FosB has also been observed within NAc in response to chronic administration of certain forms of stress. Increasing evidence indicates  that this induction represents a positive, homeostatic adaptation to chronic stress, since overexpression of \u2206FosB in this brain region promotes resilience to stress, whereas blockade of its activity promotes stress susceptibility. Chronic  administration of several antidepressant medications also induces \u2206FosB in the NAc, and this induction is required for the therapeutic-like actions of these drugs in mouse models. Validation of these rodent findings is the demonstration that depressed humans, examined at autopsy, display reduced levels of \u2206FosB within the NAc. As a transcription factor, \u0394FosB produces this behavioral phenotype by regulating the expression of specific target genes, which are under  current investigation. These studies of \u0394FosB are providing new insight into the  molecular basis of depression and antidepressant action, which is defining a host of new targets for possible therapeutic development.", "25347353": "Author information:  (1)Fishberg Department of Neuroscience and Friedman Brain Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.

Recent work in addiction models demonstrates that the transcription  factor \u0394FosB and protein kinase calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) are co-regulated in nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain reward region implicated in  both addiction and depression models including social defeat. Previous work has also demonstrated that \u0394FosB is induced in NAc after chronic social defeat stress or after chronic antidepressant treatment, wherein it mediates a pro-resilience or antidepressant-like phenotype. Here, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that \u0394FosB binds the CaMKII\u03b1 gene promoter in NAc and that this  binding increases after mice are exposed to chronic social defeat stress. Paradoxically, chronic exposure to the antidepressant fluoxetine reduces binding  of \u0394FosB to the CaMKII\u03b1 promoter and reduces CaMKII expression in NAc, despite the fact that \u0394FosB is induced under these conditions. These data suggest a novel epigenetic mechanism of antidepressant action, whereby fluoxetine induces some chromatin change at the CaMKII\u03b1 promoter, which blocks the \u0394FosB binding. Indeed, chronic fluoxetine reduces acetylation and increases lysine-9 dimethylation of histone H3 at the CaMKII\u03b1 promoter in NAc, effects also seen in depressed humans  exposed to antidepressants. Overexpression of CaMKII in NAc blocks fluoxetine's antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat paradigm, whereas inhibition  of CaMKII activity in NAc mimics fluoxetine exposure. These findings suggest that epigenetic suppression of CaMKII\u03b1 expression in NAc is behaviorally relevant and  offer a novel pathway for possible therapeutic intervention in depression and related syndromes.", "20089902": "Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is known to contribute to  the expression of psychostimulant sensitization by regulating dopamine (DA) overflow from DA neuron terminals in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). The present experiments explored the contribution of CaMKII in NAcc neurons postsynaptic to these terminals where it is known to participate in a number of signaling pathways that regulate responding to psychostimulant drugs. Exposure to amphetamine transiently increased alphaCaMKII levels in the shell but not the core of the NAcc. Thus, HSV (herpes simplex viral) vectors were used to transiently overexpress alphaCaMKII in NAcc neurons in drug-naive rats, and behavioral responding to amphetamine was assessed. Transiently overexpressing alphaCaMKII in the NAcc shell led to long-lasting enhancement of amphetamine-induced locomotion and self-administration manifested when alphaCaMKII levels were elevated and persisting long after they had returned to baseline. Enhanced locomotion was not observed after infection in the NAcc core or sites adjacent to the NAcc. Transient elevation of NAcc shell alphaCaMKII levels also enhanced locomotor responding to NAcc AMPA and increased phosphorylation levels of GluR1 (Ser831), a CaMKII site, both soon and long after infection. Similar increases in pGluR1 (Ser831) were observed both soon and long  after exposure to amphetamine. These results indicate that the transient increase in alphaCaMKII observed in neurons of the NAcc shell after viral-mediated gene transfer and likely exposure to amphetamine leads to neuroadaptations in AMPA receptor signaling in this site that may contribute to the long-lasting maintenance of behavioral and incentive sensitization by psychostimulant drugs like amphetamine.", "18842886": "The transcription factor deltaFosB (DeltaFosB), induced in nucleus accumbens (NAc) by chronic exposure to drugs of abuse, has been shown to mediate sensitized responses to these drugs. However, less is known about a role for DeltaFosB in regulating responses to natural rewards. Here, we demonstrate that two powerful natural reward behaviors, sucrose drinking and sexual behavior, increase levels of DeltaFosB in the NAc. We then use viral-mediated gene transfer to study how such DeltaFosB induction influences behavioral responses to these natural rewards. We demonstrate that overexpression of DeltaFosB in the NAc increases sucrose intake and promotes aspects of sexual behavior. In addition, we show that animals with previous sexual experience, which exhibit increased DeltaFosB levels, also show an increase in sucrose consumption. This work suggests that DeltaFosB is not only induced in the NAc by drugs of abuse, but also by natural rewarding stimuli. Additionally, our findings show that chronic exposure to stimuli that induce DeltaFosB in the NAc can increase consumption of other natural rewards.", "17561814": "The transcription factor DeltaFosB (Delta FosB) accumulates in a region-specific  manner in the brain during chronic exposure to stress, drugs of abuse or other chronic stimuli. Once induced, DeltaFosB persists in the brain for at least several weeks following cessation of the chronic stimulus. The biochemical basis  of the persistent expression of DeltaFosB has remained unknown. Here, we show that the FosB C-terminus, absent in DeltaFosB as a result of alternative splicing, contains two degron domains. Pulse-chase experiments of C-terminal truncation mutants of full-length FosB indicate that removal of its most C-terminal degron increases its half-life approximately fourfold, and prevents its proteasome-mediated degradation and ubiquitylation, properties similar to DeltaFosB. In addition, removal of a second degron domain, which generates DeltaFosB, further stabilizes FosB approximately twofold, but in a proteasome-independent manner. These data indicate that alternative splicing specifically removes two destabilizing elements from FosB in order to generate a  longer-lived transcription factor, DeltaFosB, in response to chronic perturbations to the brain.", "14566342": "DeltaFosB (a truncated form of FosB) and CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) are transcription factors induced in the brain's reward pathways after chronic exposure to drugs of abuse.

However, unlike CREB, short-term and prolonged DeltaFosB induction had opposing effects on gene expression. Gene expression induced by short-term DeltaFosB and by CREB was strikingly similar, and both reduced the rewarding effects of cocaine, whereas prolonged DeltaFosB expression increased drug reward. Gene expression after a short cocaine treatment was more dependent on CREB, whereas gene expression after a longer cocaine treatment became increasingly DeltaFosB dependent. These findings help define the molecular functions of CREB and DeltaFosB and identify clusters of genes that contribute to cocaine addiction.", "26232229": "Recent progress in understanding the diversity of midbrain dopamine neurons has highlighted the importance--and the challenges--of defining mammalian neuronal cell types. Although neurons may be best categorized using inclusive criteria spanning biophysical properties, wiring of inputs, wiring of outputs, and activity during behavior, linking all of these measurements to cell types within  the intact brains of living mammals has been difficult. Here, using an array of intact-brain circuit interrogation tools, including CLARITY, COLM, optogenetics,  viral tracing, and fiber photometry, we explore the diversity of dopamine neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). We identify two parallel nigrostriatal dopamine neuron subpopulations differing in biophysical properties, input wiring, output wiring to dorsomedial striatum (DMS) versus dorsolateral striatum (DLS), and natural activity patterns during free behavior.

However, the precise physiological relevance of this signaling pathway in mediating dopamine behaviors is still unclear. Here we report that stimulation of dopamine receptor signaling in vivo with systemic administration of apomorphine, amphetamine, and cocaine leads to increased production of inositol triphosphate (IP3) in the mouse striatum. Using  selective antagonists and dopamine D1 and D2 receptor knock-out animals, we show  that the production of IP3 is mediated by the D1 receptor, but not the D2 receptor. A selective blocker of PLC\u03b2, U73122, was used to assess the physiological relevance of D1-mediated IP3 production. We show that U73122 inhibits the locomotor-stimulating effects of apomorphine, amphetamine, cocaine,  and SKF81297. Furthermore, U73122 also suppresses the spontaneous hyperactivity exhibited by dopamine transporter knock-out mice. Importantly, the effects of U73122 are selective to dopamine-mediated hyperactivity, as this compound does not affect hyperactivity induced by the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist MK801. Finally, we present evidence showing that an imbalance of D1- and D2-mediated signaling following U73122 treatment modifies the locomotor output of animals from horizontal locomotor activity to vertical activity, further highlighting the importance of the PLC\u03b2 pathway in the regulation of forward locomotion via dopamine receptors.", "21481843": "BACKGROUND: Prominent neurobiological theories of addiction posit a central role  for aberrant mesolimbic dopamine release but disagree as to whether repeated drug experience blunts or enhances this system. Although drug withdrawal diminishes dopamine release, drug sensitization augments mesolimbic function, and both processes have been linked to drug seeking. One possibility is that the dopamine  system can rapidly switch from dampened to enhanced release depending on the specific drug-predictive environment. To test this, we examined dopamine release  when cues signaled delayed cocaine delivery versus imminent cocaine self-administration. METHODS: Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry was used to examine real-time dopamine release while simultaneously monitoring behavioral indexes of aversion as rats experienced a sweet taste cue that predicted delayed cocaine availability and during self-administration. Furthermore, the impact of cues signaling delayed drug availability on intracranial self-stimulation, a broad measure of reward function, was assessed. RESULTS: We observed decreased mesolimbic dopamine concentrations, decreased reward sensitivity, and negative affect in response to the cocaine-predictive taste cue that signaled delayed cocaine availability. Importantly, dopamine concentration rapidly switched to elevated levels to cues signaling imminent cocaine delivery in the subsequent self-administration session.

As a result, information processing between these structures is likely  to be bidirectional. Using evoked potential measures, we examined the interactions of these inputs on synaptic plasticity within the accumbens. Our results show that the direction of information flow between the prefrontal cortex and limbic structures determines the synaptic plasticity that these inputs exhibit within the accumbens. Moreover, this synaptic plasticity at hippocampal and prefrontal inputs selectively involves dopamine D1 and D2 activation or inactivation, respectively. Repeated cocaine administration disrupted this synaptic plasticity at hippocampal and prefrontal cortical inputs and goal-directed behavior in the spatial maze task. Thus, interactions of limbic-prefrontal cortical synaptic plasticity and its dysfunction within the accumbens could underlie complex information processing deficits observed in individuals following psychostimulant administration.", "10662853": "Dual-probe microdialysis (with HPLC and electrochemical detection) in freely moving rats and single-unit recording in anesthetized rats were used to study the extent to which impulse flow through the ventral tegmental area (VTA) contributes to elevations in nucleus accumbens (NAS) dopamine (DA) evoked by stimulation of the ventral subiculum (VS). During perfusion of artificial extracellular fluid into the VTA, injections of 0.74 microgram of the excitatory amino acid NMDA into the VS elevated accumbens DA to >150% of basal values. During intra-VTA perfusion of either 1 microM tetrodotoxin (which blocks impulse flow) or 1 mM kynurenic acid (which blocks excitatory glutamate receptors), injections of NMDA into the VS failed to elevate accumbens DA. Thus, increased impulse flow through VTA DA neurons, mediated by excitatory glutamate inputs to this region, appears critical for VS stimulation to elevate NAS DA. Increased impulse flow through VTA DA neurons was confirmed using single-unit recording in anesthetized rats. Intra-VS  NMDA injections increased the firing rates of 45% (14 of 31), decreased the firing rates of 13% (4 of 31), and had no effect on 42% (13 of 31) of VTA DA neurons. Increases in firing rates were evident within 15 min of NMDA injections, a time at which VS NMDA injections elevate accumbens DA in awake animals. The results of the present experiments identify the VTA as a critical site through which outputs from the VS modulate NAS dopaminergic neurotransmission.", "6817161": "We have investigated the distribution and organization of the projection from the hippocampal formation to the nucleus accumbens in the rat. In the first experiments, horseradish peroxidase was injected into the fimbria fornicis. This  procedure resulted in massive anterograde labelling of fornix fibers, and enabled the hippocampo--accumbens projection to be charted in detail. Labelled fornix fibers are distributed to the entire length of the nucleus accumbens and do not spread lateral to the anterior limb of the anterior commissure, that is, the projection is limited to the medial nucleus accumbens. Terminal labelling is particularly dense in a caudal dorsomedial sector of accumbens immediately adjacent to the septum. In the second part of the study, horseradish peroxidase was microelectrophoretically injected into the nucleus accumbens, in order to confirm the findings from the anterograde experiments. When the deposit was localized within the fornix distribution field, as indicated by the first experiment, retrogradely-labelled cells were observed in the subiculum, prosubiculum, and to a lesser extent, in hippocampal field CAI. When the deposit  was located outside of the fornix distribution field, no hippocampal labelling was noted. The topography of the projection, suggested by the retrograde labelling experiments, is discussed. The findings confirm earlier reports of such a projection from the hippocampal formation to the nucleus accumbens, and with the use of a relatively novel anterograde-horseradish peroxidase technique, provide a picture of fiber labelling representing the entire field of origin of the fornix system. The striatal projection field of this pathway is discussed in  relation to other striatal afferents, with particular emphasis on limbic afferentation of the striatum. Finally, the so-called 'hippocampal district' of striatum is discussed with respect to its neurotransmitter composition, as well as its functional importance regarding limbic system influence on central motor mechanisms.", "24623766": "Decreased medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neuronal activity is associated with social defeat-induced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the decreased mPFC activity and its prodepressant role remain unknown. We show here that induction of the transcription factor \u0394FosB in mPFC, specifically in the prelimbic (PrL) area, mediates susceptibility to stress. \u0394FosB induction in PrL occurred selectively in susceptible mice after chronic social defeat stress, and overexpression of \u0394FosB  in this region, but not in the nearby infralimbic (IL) area, enhanced stress susceptibility. \u0394FosB produced these effects partly through induction of the cholecystokinin (CCK)-B receptor: CCKB blockade in mPFC induces a resilient phenotype, whereas CCK administration into mPFC mimics the anxiogenic- and depressant-like effects of social stress. We previously found that optogenetic stimulation of mPFC neurons in susceptible mice reverses several behavioral abnormalities seen after chronic social defeat stress. Therefore, we hypothesized that optogenetic stimulation of cortical projections would rescue the pathological effects of CCK in mPFC. After CCK infusion in mPFC, we optogenetically stimulated mPFC projections to basolateral amygdala or nucleus accumbens, two subcortical structures involved in mood regulation. Stimulation of corticoamygdala projections blocked the anxiogenic effect of CCK, although no effect was observed on other symptoms of social defeat. Conversely, stimulation of corticoaccumbens projections reversed CCK-induced social avoidance and sucrose preference deficits but not anxiogenic-like effects. Together, these results indicate that social stress-induced behavioral deficits are mediated partly by molecular adaptations in mPFC involving \u0394FosB and CCK through cortical projections to distinct subcortical targets.", "19251249": "BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanisms of stress-induced depressive behaviors have  been characterized extensively in male rodents; however, much less is known about female subjects, despite the fact that human depression is far more prevalent in  women. METHODS: To gain insight into these mechanisms, we performed microarray analysis  in nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region implicated in depression, in ovariectomized (OVX) and gonadally intact female mice after chronic unpredictable stress and measured stress-induced depression-like behavior in the  forced swim test (FST). Male mice were studied in the FST for comparison. RESULTS: We find that stress regulation of genes in NAc of gonadally intact female mice is blunted in OVX mice. This pattern of gene regulation is consistent with behavioral findings on the FST: the pro-depression-like effect of stress in  intact female mice is absent in OVX female and gonadally intact male mice. We identified, among many genes regulated by stress, several nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) subunits-a pro-survival transcription factor involved in cellular responses to stress-as being highly upregulated in NAc of OVX mice. Given the role of NFkappaB during stress, we hypothesized that upregulation of NFkappaB by  OVX decreases susceptibility to stress. Indeed, we show that inhibition of NFkappaB in NAc of OVX animals increases susceptibility to stress-induced depressive behaviors, whereas activation of NFkappaB in NAc of intact female subjects blocks susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a hormonal mechanism of NFkappaB regulation that contributes to stress-induced depressive behaviors in female subjects and might represent a mechanism for gender differences in prevalence rates of these disorders in humans.", "15939837": "CONTEXT: Little is known about lifetime prevalence or age of onset of DSM-IV disorders. OBJECTIVE: To estimate lifetime prevalence and age-of-onset distributions of DSM-IV disorders in the recently completed National Comorbidity Survey Replication. DESIGN AND SETTING: Nationally representative face-to-face household survey conducted between February 2001 and April 2003 using the fully structured World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. PARTICIPANTS: Nine thousand two hundred eighty-two English-speaking respondents aged 18 years and older. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime DSM-IV anxiety, mood, impulse-control, and substance use disorders. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence estimates are as follows: anxiety disorders, 28.8%;  mood disorders, 20.8%; impulse-control disorders, 24.8%; substance use disorders, 14.6%; any disorder, 46.4%. Median age of onset is much earlier for anxiety (11 years) and impulse-control (11 years) disorders than for substance use (20 years) and mood (30 years) disorders. Half of all lifetime cases start by age 14 years and three fourths by age 24 years. Later onsets are mostly of comorbid conditions, with estimated lifetime risk of any disorder at age 75 years (50.8%)  only slightly higher than observed lifetime prevalence (46.4%). Lifetime prevalence estimates are higher in recent cohorts than in earlier cohorts and have fairly stable intercohort differences across the life course that vary in substantively plausible ways among sociodemographic subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: About half of Americans will meet the criteria for a DSM-IV disorder sometime in their life, with first onset usually in childhood or adolescence.

The present study demonstrates that there are changes in GABA transmission in the accumbens at 3 weeks after discontinuing daily cocaine injections. No-net flux microdialysis revealed a significant increase in the basal levels of extracellular GABA in the accumbens of cocaine-treated rats. The elevated extracellular GABA was normalized by blocking  voltage-dependent Na+ channels and provided increased tone on GABA(B) presynaptic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors because blocking GABA(B) receptors produced a greater elevation in extracellular GABA, dopamine, and glutamate in cocaine-treated compared with control subjects. For many G-protein-coupled receptors, increased agonist can cause receptor desensitization. Consistent with  GABA(B) receptor desensitization, baclofen-stimulated GTPgammaS binding was reduced, and the reduction in G-protein coupling was accompanied by reduced Ser phosphorylation of the GABA(B2) receptor subunit. No effect by repeated cocaine was found in the levels of total GABA(B1) or GABA(B2) protein. Together, these data demonstrate that withdrawal from repeated cocaine treatment produces an increase in the basal levels of extracellular GABA in the accumbens that depends  on neuronal activity. The increase may be mediated in part by functional desensitization of GABA(B) receptors, likely the result of diminished Ser phosphorylation of the GABA(B2) receptor.", "22802650": "In the basal ganglia, inputs from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are transmitted through both direct and indirect pathways and control reward-based learning. In the NAc, dopamine (DA) serves as a key neurotransmitter, modulating these two parallel pathways. This study explored how reward learning and its flexibility are controlled in a pathway-specific and DA receptor-dependent manner. We used two techniques (i) reversible neurotransmission blocking (RNB), in which transmission of the direct (D-RNB) or the indirect pathway (I-RNB) in the NAc on  both sides of the hemispheres was selectively blocked by transmission-blocking tetanus toxin; and (ii) asymmetric RNB, in which transmission of the direct (D-aRNB) or the indirect pathway (I-aRNB) was unilaterally blocked by RNB techniques and the intact side of the NAc was infused with DA agonists or antagonists. Reward-based learning was assessed by measuring goal-directed learning ability based on visual cue tasks (VCTs) or response-direction tasks (RDTs). Learning flexibility was then tested by switching from a previously learned VCT to a new VCT or RDT. D-RNB mice and D1 receptor antagonist-treated D-aRNB mice showed severe impairments in learning acquisition but normal flexibility to switch from a previously learned strategy. In contrast, I-RNB mice and D2 receptor agonist-treated I-aRNB mice showed normal learning acquisition but severe impairments not only in the flexibility to the learning switch but also in the subsequent acquisition of learning a new strategy. D1 and D2 receptors thus play distinct but cooperative roles in reward learning and its flexibility in a pathway-specific manner.", "20167474": "Learning in a constant environment, and adapting flexibly to a changing one, through changes in reinforcement contingencies or valence-free cues, depends on overlapping circuitry that interconnects the prefrontal cortex (PFC) with the striatum and is subject to several forms of neurochemical modulation.

Dopamine  (DA) neurotransmission in the medial striatum and PFC is critical for basic reinforcement learning and the integration of negative feedback during reversal learning, whilst orbitofrontal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) likely mediates this type of low level flexibility, perhaps by reducing interference from salient stimuli.

While behavior in rodent addiction models is linked with CaMKII activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell, the key cellular adaptations that forge this link are unclear. Using a mouse strain with striatal-specific expression of autonomously active CaMKII (T286D), we demonstrate that while persistent CaMKII activity induces behaviors comparable to those in mice repeatedly exposed to psychostimulants, it is insufficient to increase AMPAR-mediated synaptic strength in NAc shell. However,  autonomous CaMKII upregulates A-type K(+) current (IA) and decreases firing in shell neurons. Importantly, inactivating the transgene with doxycycline eliminates both the IA-mediated firing decrease and the elevated behavioral response to cocaine. This study identifies CaMKII regulation of IA in NAc shell neurons as a novel cellular contributor to the sensitization of cocaine reward.", "17898221": "Current cocaine users show little evidence of cognitive impairment and may perform better when using cocaine, yet withdrawal from prolonged cocaine use unmasks dramatic cognitive deficits. It has been suggested that such impairments  arise in part through drug-induced dysfunction within the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), yet the neurobiological mechanisms remain unknown. We observed that chronic cocaine self-administration increased expression of the transcription factor deltaFosB within both medial and orbitofrontal regions of the rat prefrontal cortex. However, the increase in OFC deltaFosB levels was more pronounced after self-administered rather than experimenter-administered cocaine, a pattern that was not observed in other regions. We then used rodent tests of attention and decision making to determine whether deltaFosB within the OFC contributes to drug-induced alterations in cognition. Chronic cocaine treatment produced tolerance to the cognitive impairments caused by acute cocaine. Overexpression of a dominant-negative antagonist of deltaFosB, deltaJunD, in the  OFC prevented this behavioral adaptation, whereas locally overexpressing deltaFosB mimicked the effects of chronic cocaine. Gene microarray analyses identified potential molecular mechanisms underlying this behavioral change, including an increase in transcription of metabotropic glutamate receptor subunit 5 and GABA(A) receptors as well as substance P. Identification of deltaFosB in the OFC as a mediator of tolerance to the effects of cocaine on cognition provides fundamentally new insight into the transcriptional modifications associated with addiction.", "7990513": "We applied and validated a quantitative allodynia assessment technique, using a recently developed rat surgical neuropathy model wherein nocifensive behaviors are evoked by light touch to the paw. Employing von Frey hairs from 0.41 to 15.1  g, we first characterized the percent response at each stimulus intensity. A smooth log-linear relationship was observed, with a median 50% threshold at 1.97  g (95% confidence limits, 1.12-3.57 g). Subsequently, we applied a paradigm using stimulus oscillation around the response threshold, which allowed more rapid, efficient measurements. Median 50% threshold by this up-down method was 2.4 g (1.81-2.76). Correlation coefficient between the two methods was 0.91. In neuropathic rats, good intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was found for the up-down paradigm; some variability was seen in normal rats, attributable to extensive testing. Thresholds in a sizable group of neuropathic rats showed insignificant variability over 20 days. After 50 days, 61% still met strict neuropathy criteria, using survival analysis. Threshold measurement using the up-down paradigm, in combination with the neuropathic pain model, represents a powerful tool for analyzing the effects of manipulations of the neuropathic pain  state.", "22701402": "Chronic alcohol exposure causes marked changes in reinforcement mechanisms and motivational state that are thought to contribute to the development of cravings  and relapse during protracted withdrawal. The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is a key structure of the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system. Although the NAcc plays an important role in mediating alcohol-seeking behaviors, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced neuroadaptive changes in NAcc function. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) treatment, a rat model of alcohol withdrawal and dependence, on intrinsic electrical membrane properties and glutamatergic synaptic transmission of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAcc core during protracted withdrawal. We show that CIE treatment followed by prolonged withdrawal increased the inward rectification of MSNs observed at hyperpolarized  potentials. In addition, MSNs from CIE-treated animals displayed a lower input resistance, faster action potentials (APs), and larger fast afterhyperpolarizations (fAHPs) than MSNs from vehicle-treated animals, all suggestive of increases in K(+)-channel conductances. Significant increases in the Cs(+)-sensitive inwardly rectifying K(+)-current accounted for the increased  input resistance, while increases in the A-type K(+)-current accounted for the faster APs and increased fAHPs in MSNs from CIE rats. We also show that the amplitude and the conductance of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic  acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated mEPSCs were enhanced in CIE-treated animals due to an increase in a small fraction of functional postsynaptic GluA2-lacking AMPARs.  These long-lasting modifications of excitability and excitatory synaptic receptor function of MSNs in the NAcc core could play a critical role in the neuroadaptive changes underlying alcohol withdrawal and dependence.", "18358676": "Inbred strains are genetically stable across time and laboratories, allowing scientists to accumulate a record of phenotypes, including physiological characteristics and behaviors. To date, the C57/C58 family of inbred mouse strains has been identified as having the highest innate ethanol consumption, but some lineages have rarely or never been surveyed. Thus, the purpose of the present experiment was to measure ethanol preference and intake in 22 inbred mouse strains, some of which have never been tested for ethanol consumption. Male and female mice (A/J, BALB/cByJ, BTBR+T(tf/tf), BUB/BnJ, C57BL/6J, C57BLKS/J, C58/J, CZECH/Ei, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, I/LnJ, LP/J, MA/MyJ, NOD/LtJ, NON/LtJ, NZB/B1NJ, NZW/LacJ, PERA/Ei, RIIIS/J, SEA/GnJ, SM/J, and 129S1/SvlmJ) were individually housed and given unlimited access in a two-bottle choice procedure to one bottle  containing tap water and a second containing increasing concentrations of ethanol (3%, 6%, 10%), 0.2% saccharin, and then increasing concentrations of ethanol (3%, 6%, 10%) plus 0.2% saccharin. Mice were given access to each novel solution for a total of 4 days, with a bottle side change every other day. Consistent with previous studies, C57BL/6J (B6) mice consumed an ethanol dose of >10g/kg/day whereas DBA/2J (D2) mice consumed <2g/kg/day. No strain voluntarily consumed greater doses of ethanol than B6 mice. Although the C58 and C57BLKS strains showed high ethanol consumption levels that were comparable to B6 mice, the BUB and BTBR strains exhibited low ethanol intakes similar to D2 mice. The addition of 0.2% saccharin to the ethanol solutions significantly increased ethanol intake by most strains and altered the strain distribution pattern. Strong positive correlations (rs> or =0.83) were determined between consumption of the unsweetened versus sweetened ethanol solutions. Consumption of saccharin alone was significantly positively correlated with the sweetened ethanol solutions (rs=0.62-0.81), but the correlation with unsweetened ethanol solutions was considerably lower (rs=0.37-0.45). These results add new strains to the strain mean database that will facilitate the identification of genetic relationships between voluntary ethanol consumption, saccharin preference, and other phenotypes.", "15642607": "Because of intrinsic differences between humans and mice, no single mouse model can represent all features of a complex human trait such as alcoholism. It is therefore necessary to develop partial models. One important feature is drinking  to the point where blood ethanol concentration (BEC) reaches levels that have measurable affects on physiology and/or behavior (>1.0 mg ethanol/ml blood). Most models currently in use examine relative oral self-administration from a bottle containing alcohol versus one containing water (two-bottle preference drinking),  or oral operant self-administration. In these procedures, it is not clear when or if the animals drink to pharmacologically significant levels because the drinking is episodic and often occurs over a 24-h period. The aim of this study was to identify the optimal parameters and evaluate the reliability of a very simple procedure, taking advantage of a mouse genotype (C57BL/6J) that is known to drink large quantities of ethanol. We exchanged for the water bottle a solution containing ethanol in tap water for a limited period, early in the dark cycle, in the home cage. Mice regularly drank sufficient ethanol to achieve BEC>1.0 mg ethanol/ml blood. The concentration of ethanol offered (10%, 20% or 30%) did not  affect consumption in g ethanol/kg body weight. The highest average BEC ( approximately 1.6 mg/ml) occurred when the water-to-ethanol switch occurred 3 h into the dark cycle, and when the ethanol was offered for 4 rather than 2 h. Ethanol consumption was consistent within individual mice, and reliably predicted BEC after the period of ethanol access. C57BL/6J mice from three sources provided equivalent data, while DBA/2J mice drank much less than C57BL/6J in this test. We discuss advantages of the model for high-throughput screening assays where the goal is to find other genotypes of mice that drink excessively, or to screen drugs for their efficacy in blocking excessive drinking.", "11549226": "RATIONALE: Since the mid-1970s, cross-species translational studies of prepulse inhibition (PPI) have increased at an astounding pace as the value of this neurobiologically informative measure has been optimized. PPI occurs when a relatively weak sensory event (the prepulse) is presented 30-500 ms before a strong startle-inducing stimulus, and reduces the magnitude of the startle response. In humans, PPI occurs in a robust, predictable manner when the prepulse and startling stimuli occur in either the same or different modalities (acoustic, visual, or cutaneous). OBJECTIVE: This review covers three areas of interest in human PPI studies. First, we review the normal influences on PPI related to the underlying construct of sensori- (prepulse) motor (startle reflex) gating. Second, we review PPI studies in psychopathological disorders that form a family of gating disorders. Third, we review the relatively limited but interesting and rapidly expanding literature on pharmacological influences on PPI in humans. METHODS: All studies identified by a computerized literature search that addressed the three topics of this review were compiled and evaluated. The principal studies were summarized in appropriate tables. RESULTS: The major influences on PPI as a measure of sensorimotor gating can be grouped into 11 domains. Most of these domains are similar across species, supporting the value of PPI studies in translational comparisons across species.  The most prominent literature describing deficits in PPI in psychiatrically defined groups features schizophrenia-spectrum patients and their clinically unaffected relatives. These findings support the use of PPI as an endophenotype in genetic studies. Additional groups of psychopathologically disordered patients with neuropathology involving cortico-striato-pallido-pontine circuits exhibit poor gating of motor, sensory, or cognitive information and corresponding PPI deficits. These groups include patients with obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette's syndrome, blepharospasm, temporal lobe epilepsy with psychosis, enuresis, and perhaps posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several pharmacological manipulations have been examined for their effects on PPI in healthy human subjects. In some cases, the alterations in PPI produced by these drugs in animals correspond to similar effects in humans. Specifically, dopamine  agonists disrupt and nicotine increases PPI in at least some human studies. With  some other compounds, however, the effects seen in humans appear to differ from those reported in animals. For example, the PPI-increasing effects of the glutamate antagonist ketamine and the serotonin releaser MDMA in humans are opposite to the PPI-disruptive effects of these compounds in rodents. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable evidence supports a high degree of homology between measures of PPI in rodents and humans, consistent with the use of PPI as a cross-species measure of sensorimotor gating. Multiple investigations of PPI using a variety of methods and parameters confirm that deficits in PPI are evident in schizophrenia-spectrum patients and in certain other disorders in which gating mechanisms are disturbed. In contrast to the extensive literature on clinical populations, much more work is required to clarify the degree of correspondence between pharmacological effects on PPI in healthy humans and those reported in animals.", "23466532": "Circuits that participate in specific subcomponents of feeding (e.g., gustatory perception, peripheral feedback relevant to satiety and energy balance, reward coding, etc.) are found at all levels of the neural axis. Further complexity is conferred by the wide variety of feeding-modulatory neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that act within these circuits. An ongoing challenge has been to refine the understanding of the functional specificity of these neurotransmitters and circuits, and there have been exciting advances in recent years. We focus here on foundational work of Dr. Ann Kelley that identified distinguishable actions of striatal opioid peptide modulation and dopamine transmission in subcomponents of reward processing. We also discuss her work in overlaying these  neuropharmacological effects upon anatomical pathways that link the telencephalon (cortex and basal ganglia) with feeding-control circuits in the hypothalamus. Using these seminal contributions as a starting point, we will discuss new findings that expand our understanding of (1) the specific, differentiable motivational processes that are governed by central dopamine and opioid transmission, (2) the manner in which other striatal neuromodulators, specifically acetylcholine, endocannabinoids and adenosine, modulate these motivational processes (including via interactions with opioid systems), and (3)  the organization of the cortical-subcortical network that subserves opioid-driven feeding. The findings discussed here strengthen the view that incentive-motivational properties of food are coded by substrates and neural circuits that are distinguishable from those that mediate the acute hedonic experience of food reward. Striatal opioid transmission modulates reward processing by engaging frontotemporal circuits, possibly via a hypothalamic-thalamic axis, that ultimately impinges upon hypothalamic modules dedicated to autonomic function and motor pattern control. We will conclude by discussing implications for understanding disorders of \"non-homeostatic\" feeding.", "9197269": "The effects of the active ingredient of Cannabis, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC), and of the highly addictive drug heroin on in vivo dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens were compared in Sprague-Dawley rats by brain microdialysis. Delta9-THC and heroin increased extracellular dopamine concentrations selectively in the shell of the nucleus accumbens; these effects were mimicked by the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN55212-2. SR141716A, an antagonist of central cannabinoid receptors, prevented the effects of Delta9-THC  but not those of heroin. Naloxone, a generic opioid antagonist, administered systemically, or naloxonazine, an antagonist of micro1 opioid receptors, infused  into the ventral tegmentum, prevented the action of cannabinoids and heroin on dopamine transmission. Thus, Delta9-THC and heroin exert similar effects on mesolimbic dopamine transmission through a common mu1 opioid receptor mechanism located in the ventral mesencephalic tegmentum.", "8725965": "The analysis of the behavioural and neural mechanisms of reinforcement and motivation has benefited from the recent application of learning theory and better anatomical knowledge of the connectivity of certain key neural structures, such as the nucleus accumbens. This progress has enabled the dissection of motivational processes into components that can begin to be related to the functioning of specific limbic cortical structures that project to different compartments of the ventral striatum.", "18582908": "The mu- and delta-opioid receptors located at the terminal level in nucleus accumbens are involved in the opiate modulation of dopamine release in this brain area. However, recent studies suggest that the effects of opioid drugs on the core subregion of nucleus accumbens may completely differ from those observed in  the shell. We used in vivo microdialysis to simultaneously apply selective mu- and delta-opioid receptor agonists and to measure extracellular levels of dopamine in three subregions of the accumbens, namely shell, core, and the transition zone between them. The regional analysis of these subregions of the accumbens demonstrated that basal levels of dopamine and its metabolites were higher in the core, and decreased from this subregion to the shell. Retrodialysis application to the core of both the selective mu-receptor agonist ([D-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) (1 micromol/L)) and of the selective delta-opioid receptor agonist ([D-Pen(2), D-Pen(5)]-enkephalin (DPDPE) (50 nmol/L)) increased the dialysate levels of dopamine. However, the application of  these drugs to the shell significantly reduced the dopamine levels in this subregion. Local application of the same doses of these drugs in the transition zone between the shell and the core did not significantly affect the dopamine levels in dialysates. These results suggest that the opioid circuits modulating dopaminergic activity in the shell could differ from those in the core of the nucleus accumbens.", "18272687": "Behaviorally relevant stimuli prompt midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons to switch from tonic to burst firing patterns. Similar shifts to burst activity are thought to contribute to the addictive effects of opiates and nicotine. The nucleus accumbens DA overflow produced by these drugs is a key element in their pathological effects. Using electrochemical techniques in brain slices, we explored the effects of opioids on single-spike and burst stimuli-evoked DA overflow in the dorsal and ventral striatum. In specific subregions of the nucleus accumbens, mu-opioids inhibit DA overflow elicited with single-spike stimuli while leaving that produced by burst stimuli unaffected. This is similar  to published effects of nicotinic receptor blockade or desensitization, and is mediated by opioid receptor-induced inhibition of cholinergic interneurons. Whereas delta-opioids have similar effects, kappa-opioids inhibit evoked DA overflow throughout the striatum in a manner that is not overcome with high-frequency stimuli. These observations reveal remarkable mechanistic overlap  between the effects of nicotine and opiates within the dopamine reward pathway.", "16111831": "The effect of interactions among mu- and delta-opioid receptors, especially the putative delta(1)- and delta(2)-opioid receptors, in the nucleus accumbens on accumbal dopamine release was investigated in awake rats by in vivo brain microdialysis. In agreement with previous studies, perfusion of the nucleus accumbens with the mu-, delta(1)- and delta(2)-opioid receptor agonists [D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO), [D-Pen(2,5)]-enkephalin (DPDPE) and [D-Ser(2)]Leu-enkephalin-Thr(6), respectively, significantly enhanced the extracellular amount of accumbal dopamine in a dose-related manner (5.0 nmol  and 50.0 nmol). However, the highest concentration tested (50.0 nmol) of DAMGO induced a biphasic effect, i.e. a rapid onset increase lasting for 75 min followed by a slower onset gradual and prolonged increase. The mu-opioid receptor antagonist D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Orn-Thr-Phe-Thr-NH(2) (0.15 nmol) primarily reduced the DAMGO-induced second component. The delta(1)-opioid receptor antagonist (E)-7-benzylidenenaltrexone (0.15 nmol) significantly reduced the first component and abolished the second component induced by DAMGO, while the delta(2)-opioid receptor antagonist naltriben (1.5 nmol) significantly reduced only the first component. The DPDPE (50.0 nmol)-induced dopamine increase was almost completely abolished by (E)-7-benzylidenenaltrexone, but only partially reduced by D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Orn-Thr-Phe-Thr-NH(2) and naltriben. The [D-Ser(2)]Leu-enkephalin-Thr(6) (50.0 nmol)-induced dopamine increase was almost  completely abolished by naltriben, but not at all by D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Orn-Thr-Phe-Thr-NH(2) and (E)-7-benzylidenenaltrexone. The non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (0.75 and 1.5 nmol) dose-dependently reduced the effects of DAMGO, DPDPE and [D-Ser(2)]Leu-enkephalin-Thr(6) but only to about 10-25% of the control values. Moreover, perfusion with the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (0.1 nmol) reduced the DAMGO-induced dopamine increase by 75%, while it almost completely abolished the increase induced by DPDPE or [D-Ser(2)]Leu-enkephalin-Thr(6). The results show that stimulation of mu-opioid receptors or, to a lesser degree, delta(1)-opioid receptors results in a large naloxone-sensitive increase and a small naloxone-insensitive increase of extracellular dopamine. It is suggested that the naloxone-insensitive component is also tetrodotoxin-insensitive. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that stimulation of mu-opioid receptors activates delta(1)-receptors, which in turn activate delta(2)-opioid receptors, thereby giving rise to a rapid onset increase of extracellular dopamine. In addition, it  is hypothesized that stimulation of another group of mu-opioid receptors activates a second group of delta(1)-opioid receptors that is not coupled to delta(2)-opioid receptors and mediates a slow onset increase of extracellular dopamine. Finally, it is suggested that stimulation of delta(1)- or delta(2)-opioid receptors inhibits mu-opioid receptors involved in the slow onset increase in extracellular dopamine, whereas stimulation of delta(1)-, but not delta(2)-, opioid receptors is suggested to activate mu-opioid receptors involved in the rapid increase in extracellular dopamine.", "2710338": "The effect of systemically administered amphetamine, cocaine, phencyclidine and nomifensine on the extracellular concentrations of dopamine in freely moving rats was estimated by microdialysis in the nucleus accumbens and in the dorsal caudate. All the drugs tested stimulated dopamine output in both areas but more effectively in the accumbens as compared to the caudate. Low doses of cocaine (1.0 mg/kg s.c.) stimulated dopamine output only in the nucleus accumbens. Nomifensine (1.25-5.0 mg/kg s.c.) increased by a similar extent peak dopamine output in the two dopaminergic areas but the duration of the effect was longer in the accumbens as compared to the caudate. The effect of cocaine, phencyclidine and nomifensine was prevented by systemic gamma-butyrolactone (700 mg/kg i.p.) and by omitting Ca2+ from the Ringer used for dialysis, the effect of amphetamine was insensitive to these manipulations. Thus, in contrast with amphetamine, cocaine, phencyclidine and nomifensine increase synaptic dopamine concentrations  in vivo by a mechanism which depends on intact activity of dopaminergic neurons and by an exocytotic process.", "24687412": "RATIONALE: Evidence suggests that glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) and cystine/glutamate exchanger transporter\u00a0(xCT) are critical in maintaining glutamate homeostasis. We have recently demonstrated that ceftriaxone treatment induced upregulation of GLT1 levels and attenuated ethanol intake; however, less  is known about the involvement of xCT on ethanol intake. In this study, we investigated the effects of ceftriaxone on the levels of xCT in both continuous and relapse-like ethanol drinking, as well as GLT-1 isoforms, and glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) in relapse-like ethanol intake. METHODS: P rats received free choice of 15 and 30\u00a0% ethanol and water for 5\u00a0weeks and then deprived of ethanol for 2\u00a0weeks. Rats were treated with ceftriaxone (100\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) or saline during the last 5\u00a0days of the 2-week deprivation period. After deprivation period, P rats were re-exposed to free choice of 15 and 30\u00a0% ethanol and water for nine consecutive days. A second group of P rats was given continuous ethanol access for 5\u00a0weeks, then ceftriaxone (100\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) or saline throughout the week 6. RESULTS: Ceftriaxone significantly attenuated relapse-like ethanol intake. Importantly, this effect of ceftriaxone was associated in part with upregulation  of the levels of GLT-1a and GLT-1b isoforms and xCT in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). There were no significant differences in GLAST expression among all groups. We also found that ceftriaxone treatment increased xCT levels in both PFC and NAc in continuous ethanol intake. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that xCT and GLT-1 isoforms might be target proteins for the treatment of alcohol dependence.", "22157972": "In vivo optogenetic strategies have redefined our ability to assay how neural circuits govern behavior. Although acutely implanted optical fibers have previously been used in such studies, long-term control over neuronal activity has been largely unachievable. Here we describe a method to construct implantable optical fibers to readily manipulate neural circuit elements with minimal tissue  damage or change in light output over time (weeks to months). Implanted optical fibers readily interface with in vivo electrophysiological arrays or electrochemical detection electrodes. The procedure described here, from implant  construction to the start of behavioral experimentation, can be completed in approximately 2-6 weeks. Successful use of implantable optical fibers will allow  for long-term control of mammalian neural circuits in vivo, which is integral to  the study of the neurobiology of behavior.", "18535839": "Dendritic spines are postsynaptic specializations thought to regulate the strength of synaptic transmission and play a critical role in neuronal plasticity. While changes in dendritic spine density can be pharmacologically- or environmentally-induced, the widespread utility of this important measure of synaptic plasticity in vivo has been hampered by the labor-intensive nature, and  potential for bias and inconsistency inherent in manual spine counting. Here we report a method for obtaining high-resolution, three-dimensional confocal images  of accumbens spiny neurons labeled with a diolistically delivered lipophilic fluorescence dye (DiI) that permits automated analysis of spine density and spine head diameter. The automated quantification was verified by manual counts of spine density and electron microscopic measures of spine head diameter. The density of spines was relatively constant over 2nd to 4th order dendrites within  a neuron, and spine density was normally distributed. The mean spine density (2.68 spines/microm; N = 45 neurons) was higher than previous reports, due in part to analysis in three rather than two dimensions and the capacity of lipophilic dyes to fill very thin spines. The distribution of spine head diameters was continuous and skewed to the right (mean = 0.43 microm; N = 8,891), and approximately 25% of all spines were thin and filopodia-like (< or = 0.20 microm diameter). The density of spines was not correlated with average spine head diameter or with the number of filopodia-like spines. The capacity to rapidly assess spine density and spine head diameter will facilitate quantifying  spine plasticity induced by pharmacological and environmental manipulations.", "16098484": "BACKGROUND: Rats given extended access to cocaine develop several symptoms of addiction, including a gradual escalation of drug intake, whereas rats given limited access do not. We asked here whether extended access to cocaine also produces drug-induced sensitization, a form of neurobehavioral plasticity implicated in addiction. METHODS: Rats were given limited (1 hour/session) or extended access (6 hours/session) to self-administered cocaine. Following a period of abstinence, rats were selected at random for assessment of their psychomotor response to cocaine or drug-seeking during extinction or for anatomic studies. RESULTS: When re-exposed to cocaine, rats allowed extended drug access showed greater drug-seeking behavior and were hypersensitive (sensitized) to the psychomotor activating effects of cocaine compared with rats given limited access. Extended access to cocaine was also associated with a greater increase in the density of dendritic spines on neurons specifically in the core of the nucleus accumbens (and not in the shell or medial or orbital frontal cortex). CONCLUSIONS: The transition from stable to escalated cocaine use, a hallmark of addiction, is associated with especially robust behavioral sensitization and synaptic reorganization in the core of the nucleus accumbens.", "27468917": "The increase in dopamine (DA) neurotransmission stimulated by in vivo cocaine exposure is tempered by G protein-dependent inhibitory feedback mechanisms in DA  neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). G protein-gated inwardly rectifying  K+ (GIRK/Kir3) channels mediate the direct inhibitory effect of GABAB receptor (GABABR) and D2 DA receptor (D2R) activation in VTA DA neurons. Here we examined  the effect of the DA neuron-specific loss of GIRK channels on D2R-dependent regulation of VTA DA neuron excitability and on cocaine-induced, reward-related behaviors. Selective ablation of Girk2 in DA neurons did not alter the baseline excitability of VTA DA neurons but significantly reduced the magnitude of D2R-dependent inhibitory somatodendritic currents and blunted the impact of D2R activation on spontaneous activity and neuronal excitability. Mice lacking GIRK channels in DA neurons exhibited increased locomotor activation in response to acute cocaine administration and an altered locomotor sensitization profile, as well as increased responding for and intake of cocaine in an intravenous self-administration test. These mice, however, showed unaltered cocaine-induced conditioned place preference. Collectively, our data suggest that feedback inhibition to VTA DA neurons, mediated by GIRK channel activation, tempers the locomotor stimulatory effect of cocaine while also modulating the reinforcing effect of cocaine in an operant-based self-administration task.", "23100428": "The ventral tegmental area (VTA) has a central role in the neural processes that  underlie motivation and behavioral reinforcement. Although thought to contain only dopamine and GABA neurons, the VTA also includes a recently discovered population of glutamate neurons identified through the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2. A subset of VGLUT2(+) VTA neurons corelease dopamine with glutamate at terminals in the NAc, but others do not express dopaminergic markers and remain poorly characterized. Using transgenic mice that express fluorescent proteins in distinct cell populations, we now find  that both dopamine and glutamate neurons in the medial VTA exhibit a smaller hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) than more lateral dopamine neurons and less consistent inhibition by dopamine D(2) receptor agonists. In addition, VGLUT2(+) VTA neurons project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), lateral habenula, ventral pallidum (VP), and amygdala. Optical stimulation of VGLUT2(+) projections expressing channelrhodopsin-2 further reveals functional excitatory synapses in the VP as well as the NAc. Thus, glutamate neurons form a physiologically and anatomically distinct subpopulation of VTA projection neurons.", "21743470": "Dopamine (DA) D2 receptors expressed in DA neurons (D2 autoreceptors) exert a negative feedback regulation that reduces DA neuron firing, DA synthesis and DA release. As D2 receptors are mostly expressed in postsynaptic neurons, pharmacological and genetic approaches have been unable to definitively address the in vivo contribution of D2 autoreceptors to DA-mediated behaviors. We found that midbrain DA neurons from mice deficient in D2 autoreceptors (Drd2(loxP/loxP); Dat(+/IRES-cre), referred to as autoDrd2KO mice) lacked DA-mediated somatodendritic synaptic responses and inhibition of DA release. AutoDrd2KO mice displayed elevated DA synthesis and release, hyperlocomotion and  supersensitivity to the psychomotor effects of cocaine. The mice also exhibited increased place preference for cocaine and enhanced motivation for food reward. Our results highlight the importance of D2 autoreceptors in the regulation of DA  neurotransmission and demonstrate that D2 autoreceptors are important for normal  motor function, food-seeking behavior, and sensitivity to the locomotor and rewarding properties of cocaine.", "18617195": "Dopamine is involved in drug reinforcement but its role in addiction is less clear. Here we describe PET imaging studies that investigate dopamine's involvement in drug abuse in the human brain. In humans the reinforcing effects of drugs are associated with large and fast increases in extracellular dopamine,  which mimic those induced by physiological dopamine cell firing but are more intense and protracted. Since dopamine cells fire in response to salient stimuli, supraphysiological activation by drugs is experienced as highly salient (driving  attention, arousal, conditioned learning and motivation) and with repeated drug use may raise the thresholds required for dopamine cell activation and signaling. Indeed, imaging studies show that drug abusers have marked decreases in dopamine  D2 receptors and in dopamine release. This decrease in dopamine function is associated with reduced regional activity in orbitofrontal cortex (involved in salience attribution; its disruption results in compulsive behaviors), cingulate  gyrus (involved in inhibitory control; its disruption results in impulsivity) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (involved in executive function; its disruption results in impaired regulation of intentional actions). In parallel, conditioning triggered by drugs leads to enhanced dopamine signaling when exposed to conditioned cues, which then drives the motivation to procure the drug in part by activation of prefrontal and striatal regions. These findings implicate deficits  in dopamine activity-inked with prefrontal and striatal deregulation-in the loss  of control and compulsive drug intake that results when the addicted person takes the drugs or is exposed to conditioned cues. The decreased dopamine function in addicted individuals also reduces their sensitivity to natural reinforcers. Therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring brain dopaminergic tone and activity of cortical projection regions could improve prefrontal function, enhance inhibitory control and interfere with impulsivity and compulsive drug administration while helping to motivate the addicted person to engage in non-drug related behaviors.", "18355970": "Midbrain dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra and retrorubral field play key roles in reward processing, learning and memory, and movement. Within these midbrain regions and admixed with the dopamine neurons, are also substantial populations of GABAergic neurons that regulate dopamine neuron activity and have projection targets similar to those of dopamine neurons. Additionally, there is a small group of putative glutamatergic neurons within the ventral tegmental area whose function remains unclear. Although dopamine neurons  have been intensively studied and quantified, there is little quantitative information regarding the GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. We therefore used  unbiased stereological methods to estimate the number of dopaminergic, GABAergic  and glutamatergic cells in these regions in the rat. Neurons were identified using a combination of immunohistochemistry (tyrosine hydroxylase) and in situ hybridization (glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 mRNA). In substantia nigra pars compacta 29% of cells were glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA-positive, 58% in the retrorubral field and 35% in the ventral tegmental area. There were further differences in the relative sizes of the GABAergic populations in subnuclei of the ventral tegmental area. Thus, glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA-positive neurons represented 12% of cells in the interfascicular nucleus, 30% in the parabrachial nucleus, and 45% in the parainterfascicular nucleus. Vesicular glutamate transporter 2 mRNA-positive neurons were present in the ventral tegmental area, but not substantia nigra or retrorubral field. They were mainly confined to the rostro-medial region of the ventral tegmental area, and represented approximately 2-3% of the total neurons counted ( approximately 1600 cells). These results demonstrate that GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons represent large proportions of the neurons in what are traditionally considered as dopamine nuclei and that there are considerable heterogeneities in the proportions of cell types in the different dopaminergic midbrain regions.", "16829955": "Dopamine neurotransmission is associated with high susceptibility to cocaine abuse. Positron emission tomography was used in 12 rhesus macaques to determine if dopamine D2 receptor availability was associated with the rate of cocaine reinforcement, and to study changes in brain dopaminergic function during maintenance of and abstinence from cocaine. Baseline D2 receptor availability was negatively correlated with rates of cocaine self-administration. D2 receptor availability decreased by 15-20% within 1 week of initiating self-administration  and remained reduced by approximately 20% during 1 year of exposure. Long-term reductions in D2 receptor availability were observed, with decreases persisting for up to 1 year of abstinence in some monkeys. These data provide evidence for a predisposition to self-administer cocaine based on D2 receptor availability, and  demonstrate that the brain dopamine system responds rapidly following cocaine exposure. Individual differences in the rate of recovery of D2 receptor function  during abstinence were noted.", "19793986": "The principal components of neuronal excitability include synaptic and intrinsic  membrane parameters. While recent studies indicate that cocaine exposure can induce widespread changes in synaptic function in the neural circuits for reward, intrinsic firing properties have received much less attention. Using whole-cell recording in ex vivo brain slices from cocaine-treated mice, we studied the intrinsic firing characteristics of medium-spiny projection neurons of the nucleus accumbens--a key node in the circuit that controls reward-directed behavior. Our data demonstrate that repeated in vivo cocaine (5 x 15 mg/kg, i.p., once daily, 5 d) induces opposite changes in neurons of the two main subdivisions of the accumbens, the shell and the core. While shell neurons exhibit an initial  depression in firing capacity (1-3 d abstinence) that persists for at least 2 weeks, core neurons exhibit increased firing capacity during early abstinence (1-3 d) that declines to basal levels within 2 weeks. Shared adaptations between  addictive drugs may mediate core processes of addiction. We find that amphetamine exposure (5 x 5 mg/kg, i.p., once daily, 5 d) that induced a similar degree of locomotor sensitization as cocaine also induced an indistinguishable pattern of NAc intrinsic plasticity. Finally, we provided evidence that opposite regulation  of A-type potassium current is an important factor in this bidirectional intrinsic plasticity for both cocaine and amphetamine. We propose that a persistent disparity in core/shell excitability might be an important mediator of the changes in reward circuit activity that drive drug-seeking behavior in animal models of addiction.", "8278047": "The efferent projections of the ventral pallidum in the rat were studied using anterograde tracing of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and retrograde tracing  of choleratoxin subunit B. The main aim of this study was to determine the degree of topographical organization in the outputs of the ventral pallidum. In the telencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers reach the prefrontal cortex, the ventral striatum, the lateral septum, the basolateral, lateral, and central amygdaloid nuclei, and the lateral entorhinal area. Diencephalic targets of ventral pallidal fibers are the lateral hypothalamus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, the medial part of the parafascicular nucleus and the lateral habenula. In the mesencephalon, ventral pallidal fibers terminate in the ventral tegmental area, the substantia nigra, the retrorubral area, the median raphe nucleus, the nucleus raphe magnus, the peribrachial area, the ventromedial part of the central gray substance and the locus coeruleus. The results of the experiments in which retrograde tracers were injected in different nuclei in the mesencephalon allow the distinction of two main areas in the ventral pallidum. Deposits of retrograde tracers in the substantia nigra, pars reticulata result in labeling of cells in the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum, located immediately ventral to the anterior limb of the anterior commissure. Retrograde tracer injections in other targets of the ventral mesencephalon, i.e. the dopaminergic cell groups A10, A9 or A8, or nuclei in the peribrachial area result in labeling of neurons in an extensive ventromedial and ventrolateral zone of the ventral pallidum. The medial part of this ventral pallidal zone projects to the ventral tegmental area, whereas ventral and lateral parts connect with more lateral and caudal mesencephalic targets. The projections from the ventral pallidum to the ventral striatum, the subthalamic nucleus and adjacent lateral hypothalamic area, and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus are distinctly topographically organized. The ventral pallidostriatal projections preserve a medial-to-lateral, a dorsal-to-ventral and, to a lesser degree, a rostral-to-caudal topography. With respect to the subthalamic region, the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum  projects to the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus, whereas the ventromedial and ventrolateral parts of the ventral pallidum are topographically  connected with the area of the lateral hypothalamus medially adjacent to the subthalamic nucleus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "9182943": "The effects of electrical stimulation of the ventral subiculum/CA1 region of the  hippocampus on changes in dopamine oxidation current (corresponding to dopamine efflux) in the nucleus accumbens were examined using in vivo chronoamperometry with stearate-graphite paste electrodes in urethane-anaesthetized rats. Burst-patterned monophasic pulses (10-100 Hz/burst delivered at 0.8-4 Hz) evoked  a three-component change in dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens with an initial transient increase in the dopamine signal above baseline, followed by an  immediate decrease below baseline, and thereafter by a prolonged increase in the  dopamine signal above baseline. 6-Hydroxydopamine lesions of the mesoaccumbens dopamine pathway or transection of the fimbria-fornix blocked all of the evoked changes in the dopamine signal. Both the first and third components of enhanced dopamine efflux were blocked by microinfusion into the nucleus accumbens of the ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists (+/-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione and kynurenate. Burst stimulation-evoked decreases in the dopamine signal were abolished following microinfusions into the nucleus accumbens of the metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist (+)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine. These results suggest that ventral subiculum/CA1 glutamatergic inputs to the nucleus accumbens may presynaptically modulate dopamine efflux by synaptic activation of both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors in the nucleus accumbens. These glutamate-dopamine interactions may constitute part of the mechanisms by which hippocampal signals are integrated through selective modulation of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens in both physiological and pathological conditions.", "24270188": "Author information:  (1)1] Department of Pharmacology and Systems Therapeutics, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.

METHODS: To further investigate BDNF signaling in the mesolimbic dopamine system, we analyzed tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein  changes in the NAc and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in rats following 3 weeks of  cocaine self-administration. To study the role of BDNF-TrkB activity in the VTA and NAc in cocaine reward, we used localized viral-mediated Cre recombinase expression in floxed BDNF and floxed TrkB mice to knockdown BDNF or TrkB in the VTA and NAc in cocaine place conditioning tests and TrkB in the NAc in cocaine self-administration tests. RESULTS: We found that 3 weeks of active cocaine self-administration significantly increased TrkB protein levels in the NAc shell, while yoked (passive) cocaine exposure produced a similar increase in the VTA. Localized BDNF knockdown in either region reduced cocaine reward in place conditioning, whereas  only TrkB knockdown in the NAc reduced cocaine reward. In mice self-administering cocaine, TrkB knockdown in the NAc produced a downward shift in the cocaine self-administration dose-response curve but had no effect on the acquisition of cocaine or sucrose self-administration. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data suggest that BDNF synthesized in either VTA or  NAc neurons is important for maintaining sensitivity to cocaine reward but only BDNF activation of TrkB receptors in the NAc mediates this effect. In addition, up-regulation of NAc TrkB with chronic cocaine use could promote the transition to more addicted biological states.", "18551281": "BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in the survival  and function of midbrain DA neurons. BDNF action is mediated by the TrkB receptor-tyrosine kinase, and both BDNF and TrkB transcripts are widely expressed in the rat mesolimbic pathway, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmentum area (VTA). OBJECTIVE: BDNF was previously shown to be involved in cocaine reward and relapse, as assessed in rat models. The goal of this study is to explore the role of BDNF and TrkB in the rat nucleus accumbens (NAc) in cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization and in conditioned-place preference acquisition, expression, and reinstatement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo genetic manipulations of BDNF and TrkB were performed using a lentiviral gene delivery approach to over-express these genes in the NAc and siRNA-based technology to locally knockdown gene expression. Behavioral experiments consisted of locomotor activity monitoring or cocaine-induced conditioned-place preference (CPP). RESULTS: BDNF and/or its receptor TrkB in the NAc enhance drug-induced locomotor  activity and induce sensitization in rats. Furthermore, LV-BDNF- and LV-TrkB-treated rats display enhanced cocaine-induced CPP, delayed CPP-extinction upon repeated measurements, and increased CPP reinstatement. In contrast, expression of TrkT1 (truncated form of TrkB, acting as a dominant negative) inhibits these behavioral changes. This inhibition is also observed when rats are fed doxycycline (to block lentivirus-mediated gene expression) or when injected with siRNAs-expressing lentiviruses against TrkB. In addition, we investigate the establishment, maintenance, extinction, and reinstatement of cocaine-induced CPP. We show that BDNF and TrkB-induced CPP takes place during the learning period (conditioning), whereas extinction leads to the loss of CPP. Extinction is delayed when rats are injected LV-BDNF or LV-TrkB, and in turn, priming injections of 2 mg/kg of cocaine reinstates it. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the crucial function of BDNF-through its receptor TrkB-in the enhancement of locomotor activity, sensitization, conditioned-place preference, CPP-reinstatement, and rewarding effects of cocaine in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway.", "10234039": "The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system has been implicated in drug reward, locomotor sensitization, and responding for reward-related stimuli [termed conditioned reinforcers (CR)]. Here, we investigated the effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which enhances the survival and function of dopaminergic neurons,  on stimulant-induced locomotor sensitization and responding for CR. In experiment 1, BDNF was infused into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or ventral tegmental area over 2 weeks via chronically implanted minipumps (1-2.5 microgram/d), and the psychomotor stimulant effects of cocaine (5-15 mg/kg, i.p.) were studied. We found that BDNF enhanced the initial stimulant effects of cocaine and seemed to facilitate the development of sensitization to repeated cocaine doses. In experiment 2, we studied the effects of intra-NAc BDNF infusions on responding for CR. BDNF-treated rats showed twice as many CR responses compared with controls when saline was first administered. BDNF enhanced responding on the CR lever more than four times that seen in control animals after a cocaine injection (10 mg/kg, i.p.). The enhanced response to cocaine in BDNF-treated animals persisted for more than a month after the BDNF infusions had stopped, indicating  long-lasting changes in the mesolimbic DA system caused by BDNF administration. In experiment 3, we examined locomotor sensitization to cocaine in heterozygous BDNF knock-out mice and found that the development of sensitization was delayed compared with wild-type littermates. These results demonstrate the profound effects of BDNF on the enhancement of both cocaine-induced locomotion and facilitation of CR and suggest a possible role for BDNF in long-term adaptations  of the brain to cocaine.", "21123555": "Brain stimulation and imaging studies in humans have highlighted a key role for the prefrontal cortex in clinical depression; however, it remains unknown whether excitation or inhibition of prefrontal cortical neuronal activity is associated with antidepressant responses. Here, we examined cellular indicators of functional activity, including the immediate early genes (IEGs) zif268 (egr1), c-fos, and arc, in the prefrontal cortex of clinically depressed humans obtained  postmortem. We also examined these genes in the ventral portion of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice after chronic social defeat stress, a mouse model of depression. In addition, we used viral vectors to overexpress channel rhodopsin 2 (a light-activated cation channel) in mouse mPFC to optogenetically drive \"burst\" patterns of cortical firing in vivo and examine the behavioral consequences. Prefrontal cortical tissue derived from clinically depressed humans displayed significant reductions in IEG expression, consistent with a deficit in  neuronal activity within this brain region. Mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress exhibited similar reductions in levels of IEG expression in mPFC. Interestingly, some of these changes were not observed in defeated mice that escape the deleterious consequences of the stress, i.e., resilient animals. In those mice that expressed a strong depressive-like phenotype, i.e., susceptible animals, optogenetic stimulation of mPFC exerted potent antidepressant-like effects, without affecting general locomotor activity, anxiety-like behaviors, or social memory. These results indicate that the activity of the mPFC is a key determinant of depression-like behavior, as well as antidepressant responses.", "25241061": "The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a brain region processing salient sensory and emotional information, controlling motivated behaviors, natural or drug-related reward, reward-related learning, mood, and participating in their associated psychopathologies. Mostly studied for its dopamine neurons, the VTA also includes functionally important GABA and glutamate cell populations. Behavioral evidence supports the presence of functional differences between the anterior VTA (aVTA) and the posterior VTA (pVTA), which is the topic of this review. This antero-posterior heterogeneity concerns locomotor activity, conditioned place preference and intracranial self-administration, and can be seen in response to ethanol, acetaldehyde, salsolinol, opioids including morphine, cholinergic agonists including nicotine, cocaine, cannabinoids and after local manipulation of GABA and serotonin receptors. It has also been observed after viral-mediated manipulation of GluR1, phospholipase C\u03b3 (PLC\u03b3) and cAMP response element binding  protein (CREB) expression, with impact on reward and aversion-related responses,  on anxiety and depression-related behaviors and on pain sensitivity. In this review, the substrates potentially underlying these aVTA/pVTA differences are discussed, including the VTA sub-nuclei and the heterogeneity in connectivity, cell types and molecular characteristics. We also review the role of the tail of  the VTA (tVTA), or rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which may also participate to the observed antero-posterior heterogeneity of the VTA. This region, partly located within the pVTA, is an inhibitory control center for dopamine activity. It controls VTA and substantia nigra dopamine cells, thus exerting a major influence on basal ganglia functions. This review highlights the need for a more comprehensive analysis of VTA heterogeneity.", "23578393": "The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a heterogeneous brain structure that serves a central role in motivation and reward processing. Abnormalities in the function of VTA dopamine (DA) neurons and the targets they influence are implicated in several prominent neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction and depression.  Recent studies suggest that the midbrain DA system is composed of anatomically and functionally heterogeneous DA subpopulations with different axonal projections. These findings may explain a number of previously confusing observations that suggested a role for DA in processing both rewarding as well as aversive events. Here we will focus on recent advances in understanding the neural circuits mediating reward and aversion in the VTA and how stress as well as drugs of abuse, in particular cocaine, alter circuit function within a heterogeneous midbrain DA system.

For example, there is estrous cycle-dependent variation in basal extracellular concentration of striatal DA, in amphetamine (AMPH)-stimulated DA release, and in striatal DA-mediated behaviors. Ovariectomy attenuates basal extracellular DA, AMPH-induced striatal DA release, and behaviors mediated by the striatal DA system. Estrogen rapidly and directly acts on the striatum and accumbens, via a G-protein-coupled external membrane receptor, to enhance DA release and DA-mediated behaviors. In male rats, estrogen does not affect striatal DA release, and removal of testicular hormones is without effect. These effects of estrogen also result in gender differences in sensitization to psychomotor stimulants. The effects of the gonadal hormones on the striatum and ascending DA  systems projecting to the striatum and nucleus accumbens are hypothesized to occur as follows: estrogen induces a rapid change in neuronal excitability by acting on membrane receptors located in intrinsic striatal GABAergic neurons and  on DA terminals. The effect of these two actions results in enhanced stimulated DA release through modulation of terminal excitability. These effects of gonadal  hormones are postulated to have important implications for gender differences in  susceptibility to addiction to the psychomotor stimulants. It is suggested that hormonal modulation of the striatum may have evolved to facilitate reproductive success in female rats by enhancing pacing behavior.", "24810333": "Impulsivity is a multifactorial phenomenon, determined by deficits in decision-making (impulsive choice) and impulse control (impulsive action). Recent findings indicate that impulsive behaviour is not only top-down controlled by cortical areas, but also modulated at subcortical level. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) might be a key substrate in cortico-limbic-striatal circuits involved in impulsive behaviour. Dissociable effects of the NAc subregions in various behavioural paradigms point to a potential functional distinction between NAc core and shell concerning different types of impulsivity. The present study used  reversible inactivation of the rats' NAc core and shell via bilateral microinfusion of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (0.05\u03bcg/0.3\u03bcl) and fluorophore-conjugated muscimol (FCM, 0.27\u03bcg/0.3\u03bcl) in order to study their contribution to different aspects of impulse control in a 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) and impulsive choice in a delay-based decision-making T-maze task. Acute inactivation of NAc core as well as shell by muscimol increased impulsive choice, with higher impairments of the rats' waiting capacity in the T-maze following core injections compared to shell. Intra-NAc shell infusion of muscimol also induced specific impulse control deficits in the  5-CSRTT, while deactivation of the core caused severe general impairments in task performance. FCM did not affect animal behaviour. Our findings reveal clear involvement of NAc shell in both forms of impulsivity. Both subareas play a key role in the regulation of impulsive decision-making, but show functional dichotomy regarding impulse control with the core being more implicated in motivational and motor aspects.", "21940447": "AMPA receptor (AMPAR) plasticity at glutamatergic synapses in the mesoaccumbal dopaminergic pathway has been implicated in persistent cocaine-induced behavioral responses; however, the precise mechanism underlying these changes remains unknown. Utilizing cocaine psychomotor sensitization, we have examined phosphorylation of GluA1 at key residues serine 845 (S845) and S831, as well as GluA1 cell surface levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of cocaine-preexposed mice and the role of brain-specific Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 L-type Ca\u00b2\u207a channels (LTCCs), therein. We found higher basal levels of S845 phospho-GluA1 (P-GluA1) and cell surface GluA1 in the NAc following protracted withdrawal from cocaine exposure, changes that occur independently of LTCCs. In contrast, we found that a cocaine challenge that elicits expression of the cocaine-sensitized response increases S831 P-GluA1 that further increases surface GluA1 beyond the higher basal levels. Intra-NAc pharmacological manipulations indicate that the Ca(v)1.2-activated CaM kinase II (CaMKII) mediates cocaine-induced increase in S831 P-GluA1 and that both Ca(v)1.2-activated CaMKII and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) mediate the increase in GluA1 cell surface levels specific to the sensitized response. Experiments using adenoassociated viral vectors expressing Ca(v)1.3 and ERK2 siRNA further indicate that recruitment of the Ca(v)1.2 pathway in the NAc is dependent on ventral tegmental  area Ca(v)1.3 LTCCs and ERK2. Together, these results identify candidate pathways that mediate cocaine-induced AMPAR plasticity in the NAc and provide a mechanism  linking LTCCs and GluA1 plasticity to cocaine-induced persistent behavioral changes.", "18278040": "Increases in dopamine and glutamate transmission in the nucleus accumbens independently promote the reinstatement of cocaine seeking, an animal model of relapse. Here we have tested whether cocaine reinstatement in rats depends on interactions between accumbal dopamine and glutamate systems that are mediated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-mediated kinase II (CaMKII). We show that stimulation of D1-like dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell reinstates cocaine seeking by activating L-type Ca(2+) channels and CaMKII. Cocaine reinstatement is associated with D1-like dopamine receptor-dependent increases in accumbens shell  CaMKII phosphorylated on Thr286 and glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) phosphorylated on Ser831 (a known CaMKII phosphorylation site), in addition to increases in cell-surface expression of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors in the shell. Consistent with these findings, cocaine reinstatement is attenuated by intra-shell administration of AAV10-GluR1-C99, a vector that impairs the transport of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors. Thus, CaMKII may be an essential link between accumbens shell dopamine and glutamate systems involved in the neuronal plasticity underlying cocaine craving and relapse.", "28209979": "The ability to make decisions and act quickly without hesitation can be advantageous in many settings. However, when persistently expressed, impulsive decisions and actions are considered risky, maladaptive and symptomatic of such diverse brain disorders as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, drug addiction and affective disorders.

Herein, we review what is currently known about the neural and psychological mechanisms of impulsivity, and discuss the relevance and application of these new insights to various neuropsychiatric disorders.", "17982449": "Neuroimaging studies of decision-making have generally related neural activity to objective measures (such as reward magnitude, probability or delay), despite choice preferences being subjective. However, economic theories posit that decision-makers behave as though different options have different subjective values. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that neural activity in several brain regions--particularly the ventral striatum, medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex--tracks the revealed subjective  value of delayed monetary rewards. This similarity provides unambiguous evidence  that the subjective value of potential rewards is explicitly represented in the human brain.", "16307603": "The nucleus accumbens can be subdivided into at least two anatomically distinct subregions: a dorsolateral 'core' and a ventromedial 'shell', and this distinction may extend to a functional dissociation. Here, we contrasted the effects of selective excitotoxic core and medial shell lesions on impulsive-choice behaviour using a delayed reward choice paradigm and a differential reward for low rates of responding (DRL) test, against a form of salience learning known as latent inhibition (LI). Core lesions led to enhanced impulsive choices as evidenced by a more pronounced shift from choosing a continuously reinforced lever to a partially reinforced lever, when a delay between lever press and reward delivery was imposed selectively on the former. The core lesions also impaired performance on a DRL task that required withholding the response for a fixed period of time in order to earn a reward. Medial shell lesions had no effect on these two tasks, but abolished the LI effect, as revealed by the failure of stimulus pre-exposure to retard subsequent  conditioning to that stimulus in an active avoidance procedure in the lesioned animals. As expected, selective core lesions spared LI. The double dissociations  demonstrated here support a functional segregation between nucleus accumbens core and shell, and add weight to the hypothesis that the core, but not the shell, subregion of the nucleus accumbens is preferentially involved in the control of choice behaviour under delayed reinforcement conditions and in the inhibitory control of goal-directed behaviour.", "15486304": "When humans are offered the choice between rewards available at different points  in time, the relative values of the options are discounted according to their expected delays until delivery. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the neural correlates of time discounting while subjects made a series of choices between monetary reward options that varied by delay to delivery. We demonstrate that two separate systems are involved in such decisions. Parts of the limbic system associated with the midbrain dopamine system, including paralimbic cortex, are preferentially activated by decisions involving immediately available rewards. In contrast, regions of the lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex are engaged uniformly by intertemporal choices irrespective of delay. Furthermore, the relative engagement of the two systems is directly associated with subjects' choices, with greater relative fronto-parietal activity when subjects choose longer term options.", "12373437": "RATIONALE: The developmental history and application of the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT) for measuring effects of drugs and other manipulations on attentional performance (and stimulus control) in rats is reviewed. OBJECTIVES: The 5CSRTT has been used for measuring effects of systemic drug treatments and also central manipulations such as neurochemical lesions on various aspects of attentional control, including sustained, selective and divided attention--and is relevant to the definition of neural systems of attention and applications to human disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The 5CSRTT is implemented in a specially designed operant chamber with multiple response locations ('nine-hole box') using food reinforcers to maintain  performance on baseline sessions (about 100 trials) at criterion levels of accuracy and trials completed. The 5CSRTT can be used for measuring various aspects of attentional control over performance with its main measures of accuracy, premature responding, correct response latencies and latency to collect earned food pellets. RESULTS: The data reviewed include studies mainly of systemic and intra-cerebral  effects of adrenoceptor, dopamine receptor, serotoninergic receptor and cholinergic receptor agents. These are compared with investigations of effects of selective chemical neurotoxins and excitotoxins applied to discrete parts of the  forebrain, in order to define the neural and neurochemical substrates of attentional function. Furthermore, these results are integrated with findings from in vivo microdialysis in freely moving rats or metabolic studies. CONCLUSIONS: The monoaminergic and cholinergic systems appear to play separable roles in different aspects of performance controlled by the 5CSRTT, in neural systems centred on the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex and striatum. These conclusions are considered in the methodological and theoretical context of other psychopharmacological studies of attention in animals and humans.", "14551286": "Evidence suggests that CART (cocaine-amphetamine regulated transcript) peptides are mediators or modulators of the actions of psychostimulant drugs. In this study, the effects of intra-accumbal injections of rat long form (rl) CART 55-102 were examined. Injection of the peptide alone had no effect, but pretreatment with the peptide blunted or reduced the locomotor-inducing effects of cocaine after an i.p. injection. This effect was dose related and time limited, as expected. rlCART 1-27, a CART peptide fragment not active in other studies, was without effect on cocaine-induced locomotor activity. Because the actions of cocaine involve dopamine, the effect of rlCART 55-102 on dopamine-induced locomotor activity was examined. Intraaccumbal injection of dopamine produced a dose-related and time-limited increase in locomotor activity, as expected. Coinjection of rlCART 55-102 with dopamine blunted the effect. In summary, these  data suggest that CART peptides in the nucleus accumbens would tend to oppose the actions of cocaine.", "19794408": "Rats selectively bred based on high or low reactivity to a novel environment were characterized for other behavioral and neurobiological traits thought to be relevant to addiction vulnerability. The two lines of animals, which differ in their propensity to self-administer drugs, also differ in the value they attribute to cues associated with reward, in impulsive behavior, and in their dopamine system. When a cue was paired with food or cocaine reward bred high-responder rats (bHRs) learned to approach the cue, whereas bred low-responder rats (bLRs) learned to approach the location of food delivery, suggesting that bHRs but not bLRs attributed incentive value to the cue. Moreover, although less impulsive on a measure of 'impulsive choice', bHRs were more impulsive on a measure of 'impulsive action'- ie, they had difficulty withholding an action to receive a reward, indicative of 'behavioral disinhibition'. The dopamine agonist quinpirole caused greater psychomotor activation in bHRs relative to bLRs, suggesting dopamine supersensitivity. Indeed, relative to bLRs, bHRs also had a greater proportion of dopamine D2(high) receptors, the functionally active form of the receptor, in the striatum, in spite of lower D2 mRNA levels and comparable total D2 binding. In addition, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry revealed that bHRs had more spontaneous dopamine 'release events' in the core of the nucleus accumbens than bLRs. Thus, bHRs exhibit parallels to 'externalizing disorders' in humans, representing a genetic  animal model of addiction vulnerability associated with a propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward-related cues, behavioral disinhibition, and increased dopaminergic 'tone.'", "3317472": "A psychomotor stimulant theory of addiction.", "2893431": "Drugs of abuse have in common the fact that they serve as biological rewards. They presumably do so because of their ability to activate endogenous brain circuitry. By determining the brain circuitry activated by rewarding drug injections, much can be learned about the degree to which there is a common basis for the abuse liability of seemingly different drugs. The brain circuitry activated by two classes of abused drugs, psychomotor stimulants and opiates, is  now partially understood; the current evidence suggests a shared mechanism of stimulant reward and opiate reward. The identified portion of the circuitry involves dopamine-containing cells of the ventral tegmental area and their fiber  projections to the cells of the nucleus accumbens. Morphine activates these cells in the region of the cell bodies; it may have direct actions on receptors imbedded in the dopaminergic cell membrane, or it may act on afferent terminals that synapse on the dopaminergic cell bodies or dendrites. Cocaine and amphetamine act at the terminals of the dopaminergic fibers to nucleus accumbens  and perhaps other structures. The shared activation of the dopaminergic input to  nucleus accumbens accounts for the behaviorally activating and the rewarding effects of both stimulants and opiates (the opiate stimulant action is not widely known because it is usually masked by depressant actions of opiates in other, antagonistic, brain circuits). The activation of dopaminergic systems also accounts for amphetamine euphoria; it almost certainly accounts for cocaine euphoria and it probably accounts for opiate euphoria as well. Opiates and psychomotor stimulants clearly have many other actions which are not shared; nonshared actions must account for the well-known differences in the subjective effects of opiates and stimulants. One of the major nonshared actions is physical dependence. Opiates gain access to a major component of the circuitry mediating opiate physical dependence through opiate receptors in the periaqueductal gray matter. This receptor population is anatomically distinct from the population mediating the rewarding effects of opiates in nondependent animals. While both opiates and stimulants can activate (though by quite different mechanisms and at  quite different loci) the dopaminergic circuitry underlying reward phenomena, only opiates activate the separate circuitry underlying dependence phenomena.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "11606786": "Chronic exposure to cocaine causes long-lasting behavioral changes associated with cocaine reinforcement and addiction. An important neural substrate for cocaine addiction is the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which receives dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area. Although the neural circuit of the NAc is  controlled by several other neurotransmitters, their involvement in cocaine addiction remains elusive. In this investigation, we ablated cholinergic interneurons from the adult NAc with immunotoxin-mediated cell targeting and examined the role of acetylcholine transmitter in adaptive behavioral changes associated with cocaine reinforcement and addiction. Acute exposure to cocaine induced abnormal rotation in unilaterally cholinergic cell-eliminated mice. This  abnormal turning was enhanced by repeated exposure of cocaine. In bilaterally cholinergic cell-eliminated mice, chronic cocaine administration induced a prominent and progressive increase in locomotor activity. Moreover, these mice showed robust conditioned place preference with a lower dose of cocaine, compared with wild-type littermates. This investigation demonstrates that acetylcholine in the NAc plays a key role in both acute and chronic actions of cocaine.", "18535246": "Both impulsivity and novelty-seeking have been suggested to be behavioral markers of the propensity to take addictive drugs. However, their relevance for the vulnerability to compulsively seek and take drugs, which is a hallmark feature of addiction, is unknown. We report here that, whereas high reactivity to novelty predicts the propensity to initiate cocaine self-administration, high impulsivity predicts the development of addiction-like behavior in rats, including persistent or compulsive drug-taking in the face of aversive outcomes. This study shows experimental evidence that a shift from impulsivity to compulsivity occurs during the development of addictive behavior, which provides insights into the genesis and neural mechanisms of drug addiction.", "15078556": "A major goal of research on addiction is to identify the molecular mechanisms of  long-lasting behavioural alterations induced by drugs of abuse. Cocaine and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the striatum and blockade of the ERK pathway prevents establishment of conditioned place preference to these drugs. However, it is not known whether activation of ERK in the striatum is specific for these two drugs and/or this brain region. We studied the appearance of phospho-ERK immunoreactive neurons in  CD-1 mouse brain following acute administration of drugs commonly abused by humans, cocaine, morphine, nicotine and THC, or of other psychoactive compounds including caffeine, scopolamine, antidepressants and antipsychotics. Each drug generated a distinct regional pattern of ERK activation. All drugs of abuse increased ERK phosphorylation in nucleus accumbens, lateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central amygdala and deep layers of prefrontal cortex, through  a dopamine D1 receptor-dependent mechanism. Although some non-addictive drugs moderately activated ERK in a few of these areas, they never induced this combined pattern of strong activation. Antidepressants and caffeine activated ERK in hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Typical antipsychotics mildly activated ERK in dorsal striatum and superficial prefrontal cortex, whereas clozapine had no effect in the striatum, but more widespread effects in cortex and amygdala. Our results outline a subset of structures in which ERK activation might specifically contribute to the long-term effects of drugs of abuse, and suggest mapping ERK activation in brain as a way to identify potential sites of action of psychoactive drugs.", "26232228": "Dopamine (DA) neurons in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) integrate complex inputs to encode multiple signals that influence motivated behaviors via  diverse projections. Here, we combine axon-initiated viral transduction with rabies-mediated trans-synaptic tracing and Cre-based cell-type-specific targeting to systematically map input-output relationships of VTA-DA neurons. We found that VTA-DA (and VTA-GABA) neurons receive excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory input from diverse sources. VTA-DA neurons projecting to different forebrain regions exhibit specific biases in their input selection. VTA-DA neurons projecting to lateral and medial nucleus accumbens innervate largely non-overlapping striatal targets, with the latter also sending extensive extra-striatal axon collaterals. Using electrophysiology and behavior, we validated new circuits identified in our tracing studies, including a previously  unappreciated top-down reinforcing circuit from anterior cortex to lateral nucleus accumbens via VTA-DA neurons. This study highlights the utility of our viral-genetic tracing strategies to elucidate the complex neural substrates that  underlie motivated behaviors.", "23913271": "Predictions about future rewarding events have a powerful influence on behaviour. The phasic spike activity of dopamine-containing neurons, and corresponding dopamine transients in the striatum, are thought to underlie these predictions, encoding positive and negative reward prediction errors. However, many behaviours are directed towards distant goals, for which transient signals may fail to provide sustained drive. Here we report an extended mode of reward-predictive dopamine signalling in the striatum that emerged as rats moved towards distant goals. These dopamine signals, which were detected with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV), gradually increased or--in rare instances--decreased as the animals navigated mazes to reach remote rewards, rather than having phasic or steady tonic profiles. These dopamine increases (ramps) scaled flexibly with both the distance and size of the rewards. During learning, these dopamine signals showed spatial preferences for goals in different locations and readily changed in magnitude to reflect changing values of the distant rewards. Such prolonged dopamine signalling could provide sustained motivational drive, a control mechanism that may be important for normal behaviour and that can be impaired in  a range of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders.", "17459426": "Fast scan cyclic voltammetry is an electrochemical technique used to measure dynamics of transporter-mediated monoamine uptake in real time and provides a tool to evaluate the detailed effects of monoamine uptake inhibitors and releasers on dopamine and serotonin transporter function. We measured the effects of cocaine, methylphenidate, 2beta-propanoyl-3beta-(4tolyl) tropane (PTT), fluoxetine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), phentermine and fenfluramine on dopamine and serotonin uptake following electrically stimulated release in mouse caudate-putamen and substantia nigra pars reticulata slices. We determined rank orders of uptake inhibition effects based on two variables; increases in apparent K(m) for dopamine and serotonin uptake and inhibition constant (K(i)) values. For example, the rank order of uptake inhibition based on apparent K(m) values at the dopamine transporter was amphetamine>or=PTT>or=methylphenidate>>methamphetamine=phentermine=MDMA>cocaine>> fluoxetine=fenfluramine, and at the serotonin transporter was fluoxetine=methamphetamine=fenfluramine=MDMA > amphetamine=cocaine=PTT>or=methylphenidate>phentermine. Additionally, changes in  electrically stimulated release were documented. This is the first study using voltammetry to measure the effects of a wide range of monoamine uptake inhibitors and releasers on dopamine and serotonin uptake in mouse brain slices. These studies also highlight methodological considerations for comparison of effects between heterogeneous brain regions.", "14500617": "BACKGROUND: Dopamine is a potent neuromodulator in the brain, influencing a variety of motivated behaviors and involved in several neurologic diseases. Measurements of extracellular dopamine in the brains of experimental animals have traditionally focused on a tonic timescale (minutes to hours). However, dopamine  concentrations are now known to fluctuate on a phasic timescale (subseconds to seconds). APPROACH: Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry provides analytical chemical measurements  of phasic dopamine signals in the rat brain. CONTENT: Procedural aspects of the technique are discussed, with regard to appropriate use and in comparison with other methods. Finally, examples of data collected using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry are summarized, including naturally  occurring dopamine transients and signals arising from electrical stimulation of  dopamine neurons. SUMMARY: Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry offers real-time measurements of changes in extracellular dopamine concentrations in vivo. With its subsecond time resolution, micrometer-dimension spatial resolution, and chemical selectivity, it is the most suitable technique currently available to measure transient concentration changes of dopamine.", "10844017": "The activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulates the physiological activity of AMPA-type glutamate receptors. In this study, phosphorylation of the  AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 at Ser(845) was increased in neostriatal slices by activation of D1-type dopamine receptors and by inhibitors of protein phosphatase 1/protein phosphatase 2A. In contrast, Ser(831), a residue which, when phosphorylated by protein kinase C or calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, increases AMPA receptor channel conductance, was unaffected by either D1 or D2 receptor agonists in neostriatal slices. The phosphorylation of Ser(845), but not Ser(831), was strongly increased in neostriatum in vivo in response to the psychostimulants cocaine and methamphetamine. The effects of dopamine and psychostimulants on the phosphorylation of GluR1 were attenuated in dopamine and  cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein M(r) 32 kDa (DARPP-32) knock-out mice. These results identify DARPP-32 and AMPA-type glutamate receptors as likely essential cellular effectors for psychostimulant actions.", "23013293": "The nucleus accumbens is a forebrain region responsible for drug reward and goal-directed behaviors. It has long been believed that drugs of abuse exert their addictive properties on behavior by altering the strength of synaptic communication over long periods of time. To date, attempts at understanding the relationship between drugs of abuse and synaptic plasticity have relied on the high-frequency long-term potentiation model of T.V. Bliss & T. L\u00f8mo [(1973) Journal of Physiology, 232, 331-356]. We examined synaptic plasticity using spike-timing-dependent plasticity, a stimulation paradigm that reflects more closely the in vivo firing patterns of mouse core nucleus accumbens medium spiny  neurons and their afferents. In contrast to other brain regions, the same stimulation paradigm evoked bidirectional long-term plasticity. The magnitude of  spike-timing-dependent long-term potentiation (tLTP) changed with the delay between action potentials and excitatory post-synaptic potentials, and frequency, whereas that of spike-timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD) remained unchanged. We showed that tLTP depended on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, whereas tLTD relied on action potentials. Importantly, the intracellular calcium  signaling pathways mobilised during tLTP and tLTD were different. Thus, calcium-induced calcium release underlies tLTD but not tLTP. Finally, we found that the firing pattern of a subset of medium spiny neurons was strongly inhibited by dopamine receptor agonists. Surprisingly, these neurons were exclusively associated with tLTP but not with tLTD. Taken together, these data point to the existence of two subgroups of medium spiny neurons with distinct properties, each displaying unique abilities to undergo synaptic plasticity.", "19587272": "The glutamate receptor-associated protein Homer2 regulates alcohol-induced neuroplasticity within the nucleus accumbens (NAC), but the precise intracellular signaling cascades involved are not known. This study examined the role for NAC metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-Homer2-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in regulating excessive alcohol consumption within the context of the scheduled high alcohol consumption (SHAC) model of binge alcohol drinking. Repeated bouts of binge drinking ( approximately 1.5 g/kg per 30 min) elevated NAC Homer2a/b expression and increased PI3K activity in this region. Virus-mediated knockdown of NAC Homer2b expression attenuated alcohol intake, as  did an intra-NAC infusion of the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP [2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride] (0.1-1 microg/side) and the PI3K antagonist wortmannin (50 ng/side), supporting necessary roles for mGluR5/Homer2/PI3K in binge alcohol drinking. Moreover, when compared with wild-type littermates, transgenic mice with an F1128R point mutation in mGluR5 that markedly reduces Homer binding exhibited a 50% reduction in binge alcohol drinking, which was related to reduced NAC basal PI3K activity. Consistent with the hypothesis that mGluR5-Homer-PI3K signaling may be a mechanism governing excessive alcohol intake, the \"anti-binge\" effects of MPEP and wortmannin were not additive, nor were they observed in the mGluR5(F1128R) transgenic mice. Finally, mice genetically selected for a high versus low SHAC phenotype differed  in NAC mGluR, Homer2, and PI3K activity, consistent with the hypothesis that augmented NAC mGluR5-Homer2-PI3K signaling predisposes a high binge alcohol-drinking phenotype. Together, these data point to an important role for NAC mGluR5-Homer2-PI3K signaling in regulating binge-like alcohol consumption that has relevance for our understanding of the neurobiology of alcoholism and its pharmacotherapy.", "24107942": "Sirtuins (SIRTs), class III histone deacetylases, are well characterized for their control of cellular physiology in peripheral tissues, but their influence in brain under normal and pathological conditions remains poorly understood. Here, we establish an essential role for SIRT1 and SIRT2 in regulating behavioral responses to cocaine and morphine through actions in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region. We show that chronic cocaine administration increases  SIRT1 and SIRT2 expression in the mouse NAc, while chronic morphine administration induces SIRT1 expression alone, with no regulation of all other sirtuin family members observed. Drug induction of SIRT1 and SIRT2 is mediated in part at the transcriptional level via the drug-induced transcription factor \u0394FosB and is associated with robust histone modifications at the Sirt1 and Sirt2 genes. Viral-mediated overexpression of SIRT1 or SIRT2 in the NAc enhances the rewarding effects of both cocaine and morphine. In contrast, the local knockdown of SIRT1 from the NAc of floxed Sirt1 mice decreases drug reward. Such behavioral effects  of SIRT1 occur in concert with its regulation of numerous synaptic proteins in NAc as well as with SIRT1-mediated induction of dendritic spines on NAc medium spiny neurons. These studies establish sirtuins as key mediators of the molecular and cellular plasticity induced by drugs of abuse in NAc, and of the associated behavioral adaptations, and point toward novel signaling pathways involved in drug action.", "22072694": "Chronic exposure to addictive drugs enhances cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-regulated gene expression in nucleus accumbens (NAc), and these effects are thought to reduce the positive hedonic effects of passive cocaine administration. Here, we used viral-mediated gene transfer to produce short- and  long-term regulation of CREB activity in NAc shell of rats engaging in volitional cocaine self-administration. Increasing CREB expression in NAc shell markedly enhanced cocaine reinforcement of self-administration behavior, as indicated by leftward (long-term) and upward (short-term) shifts in fixed ratio dose-response  curves. CREB also increased the effort exerted by rats to obtain cocaine on more  demanding progressive ratio schedules, an effect highly correlated with viral-induced modulation of BDNF protein in the NAc shell. CREB enhanced cocaine  reinforcement when expressed either throughout acquisition of self-administration or when expression was limited to postacquisition tests, indicating a direct effect of CREB independent of reinforcement-related learning. Downregulating endogenous CREB in NAc shell by expressing a short hairpin RNA reduced cocaine reinforcement in similar tests, while overexpression of a dominant-negative CREB(S133A) mutant had no significant effect on cocaine self-administration. Finally, increasing CREB expression after withdrawal from self-administration enhanced cocaine-primed relapse, while reducing CREB levels facilitated extinction of cocaine seeking, but neither altered relapse induced by cocaine cues or footshock stress. Together, these findings indicate that CREB activity in NAc shell increases the motivation for cocaine during active self-administration  or after withdrawal from cocaine. Our results also highlight that volitional and  passive drug administration can lead to substantially different behavioral outcomes.", "1604710": "Drugs of abuse are very powerful reinforcers, and even in conditions of limited access (where the organism is not dependent) these drugs will motivate high rates of operant responding. This presumed hedonic property and the drugs' neuropharmacological specificity provide a means of studying the neuropharmacology and neuroanatomy of brain reward. Three major brain systems appear to be involved in drug reward--dopamine, opioid and GABA. Evidence suggests a midbrain-forebrain-extrapyramidal circuit with its focus in the nucleus accumbens. Data implicating dopamine and opioid systems in indirect sympathomimetic and opiate reward include critical elements in both the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental areas. Ethanol reward appears to depend on an interaction with the GABAA receptor complex but may also involve common elements  such as dopamine and opioid peptides in this midbrain-forebrain-extrapyramidal circuit. These results suggest that brain reward systems have a multidetermined neuropharmacological basis that may involve some common neuroanatomical elements.", "27046646": "Epigenetic consequences of exposure to psychostimulants are substantial but the relationship of these changes to compulsive drug taking and abstinence is not clear. Here, we used a paradigm that helped to segregate rats that reduce or stop their methamphetamine (METH) intake (nonaddicted) from those that continue to take the drug compulsively (addicted) in the presence of footshocks. We used that model to investigate potential alterations in global DNA hydroxymethylation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) because neuroplastic changes in the NAc may participate in the development and maintenance of drug-taking behaviors. We found that METH-addicted rats did indeed show differential DNA hydroxymethylation in comparison with both control and nonaddicted rats. Nonaddicted rats also showed differences from control rats. Differential DNA hydroxymethylation observed in addicted rats occurred mostly at intergenic sites located on long and short interspersed elements. Interestingly, differentially hydroxymethylated regions in genes encoding voltage (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kvb1 and Kv2.2)- and calcium (Kcnma1, Kcnn1 and Kcnn2)-gated potassium channels observed in the NAc of nonaddicted rats were  accompanied by increased mRNA levels of these potassium channels when compared with mRNA expression in METH-addicted rats. These observations indicate that changes in differentially hydroxymethylated regions and increased expression of specific potassium channels in the NAc may promote abstinence from drug-taking behaviors. Thus, activation of specific subclasses of voltage- and/or calcium-gated potassium channels may provide an important approach to the beneficial treatment for METH addiction.", "25596492": "Stimulation of D1-like dopamine receptors (D1DRs) or D2-like dopamine receptors (D2DRs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell reinstates cocaine seeking in rats,  an animal model of relapse. D2DRs and D1DRs activate protein kinase C (PKC) and recent studies indicate that activation of PKC in the NAc plays an important role in the reinstatement of drug seeking induced by a systemic cocaine priming injection. In the present study, pharmacological inhibition of PKC in the NAc shell attenuated cocaine seeking induced by intra-accumbens shell microinjection  of a D2DR agonist, but not a D1DR agonist. D1DRs and D2DRs are primarily expressed on different accumbens medium spiny (MSN) neurons. Neuronal signaling and activity were assessed in these two populations of NAc neurons with transgenic mice expressing fluorescent labels under the control of D1DR and D2DR  promoters. Following the extinction of cocaine self-administration, bath application of a PKC inhibitor produced similar effects on single evoked excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic currents in D1DR- and D2DR-positive MSNs  in the NAc shell. However, inhibition of PKC preferentially improved the ability  of excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses to sustain responding to brief train  of stimuli specifically in D2DR-positive MSNs. This effect did not appear to involve modulation of presynaptic release mechanisms. Taken together, these findings indicate that the reinstatement of cocaine seeking is at least partially due to D2DR-dependent increases in PKC signaling in the NAc shell, which reduce excitatory synaptic efficacy in D2DR-expressing MSNs.", "25516281": "In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of  systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html webcite.", "20223203": "The cellular mechanisms underlying pathological alcohol seeking remain poorly understood. Here, we show an enhancement of nucleus accumbens (NAcb) core action  potential firing ex vivo after protracted abstinence from alcohol but not sucrose self-administration. Increased firing is associated with reduced small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK) currents and decreased SK3 but not SK2 subunit protein expression. Furthermore, SK activation ex vivo produces greater firing suppression in NAcb core neurons from alcohol- versus sucrose-abstinent rats. Accordingly, SK activation in the NAcb core significantly reduces alcohol but not sucrose seeking after abstinence. In contrast, NAcb shell and lateral dorsal striatal firing ex vivo are not altered after abstinence from  alcohol, and SK activation in these regions has little effect on alcohol seeking. Thus, decreased NAcb core SK currents and increased excitability represents a critical mechanism that facilitates motivation to seek alcohol after abstinence.", "17761777": "The nucleus accumbens is involved in the modulation of motivated behaviour by reward-associated sensory information. However, little is known about the specific nature of the nucleus accumbens' contribution to generating movement. We investigated motor encoding by nucleus accumbens neurons in rats performing a delayed response task that allowed us to dissociate the effects of sensory and motor events on firing. In a subset of neurons, firing in the delay period preceding movement was highly selective; this selectivity was tightly correlated  with the direction of the subsequent movement, but not with the sensory properties of the instructive cue. Direction selectivity in this population of neurons developed over the course of the delay period, with the strongest selectivity apparent just prior to movement onset. Selectivity was also apparent  in nucleus accumbens neurons during movement, such that firing showed a tight correlation with movement direction, but not the instructive cue presented nor the spatial destination of the movement. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a subpopulation of nucleus accumbens neurons contributes to the selection and execution of specific motivated behaviours.", "16885524": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a forebrain area in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system that regulates many aspects of drug addiction. Neuronal activity in the NAc is modulated by different subtypes of DA receptors. Although DA signaling has received considerable attention, the mechanisms underlying D(2)-class receptor (D(2)R) modulation of firing in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) localized within the NAc remain ambiguous. In the present study, we performed whole cell current-clamp recordings in rat brain slices to determine whether and how D(2)R modulation of K(+) channel activity regulates the intrinsic excitability of NAc neurons in the core region. D(2)R stimulation by quinpirole or DA significantly and dose-dependently decreased evoked Na(+) spikes. This D(2)R effect on inhibiting evoked firing was abolished by antagonism of D(2)Rs, reversed by blockade of voltage-sensitive, slowly inactivating A-type K(+) currents (I(As)),  or eliminated by holding membrane potentials at levels in which I(As) was inactivated. It was also mimicked by inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase  (PKA) activity, but not phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) activity. Moreover, D(2)R stimulation also reduced the inward rectification and depolarized the resting membrane potentials (RMPs) by decreasing \"leak\" K(+) currents. However, the D(2)R effects on inward rectification and RMP were blocked by inhibition of PI-PLC, but not PKA activity. These findings indicate that, with facilitated intracellular Ca(2+) release and activation of the D(2)R/G(q)/PLC/PIP(2) pathway, the D(2)R-modulated changes in the NAc excitability are dynamically regulated and integrated by multiple K(+) currents,  including but are not limited to I(As), inwardly rectifying K(+) currents (I(Kir)), and \"leak\" currents (I(K-2P)).", "12832531": "Dopamine in the nucleus accumbens modulates both motivational and addictive behaviors. Dopamine D1 and D2 receptors are generally considered to exert opposite effects at the cellular level, but many behavioral studies find an apparent cooperative effect of D1 and D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens. Here, we show that a dopamine-induced enhancement of spike firing in nucleus accumbens neurons in brain slices required both D1 and D2 receptors. One intracellular mechanism that might underlie cooperativity of D1 and D2 receptors  is activation of specific subtypes of adenylyl cyclases by G-protein betagamma subunits (Gbetagamma) released from the Gi/o-linked D2 receptor in combination with Galpha(s)-like subunits from the D1 receptor. In this regard, dopaminergic enhancement of spike firing was prevented by inhibitors of protein kinase A or Gbetagamma. Furthermore, intracellular perfusion with Gbetagamma enabled D1 receptor activation but not D2 receptor activation to enhance spike firing. Finally, our data suggest that these pathways may increase spike firing by inhibition of a slow A-type potassium current. These results provide evidence for a novel cellular mechanism through which cooperative action of D1 and D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens could mediate dopamine-dependent behaviors.", "10357457": "This study investigated the areas of the nucleus accumbens shell involved in the  modulation of feeding behavior by GABAergic stimulation and characterized this response using macronutrient diets as well as saline, sucrose, and saccharin solutions. The GABA agonist muscimol induced a pronounced feeding response when infused in the medial nucleus accumbens shell but not in the ventral or lateral accumbens shell. In the macronutrient preference study, muscimol increased the intake of both high fat and high carbohydrate diets when presented separately. When both diets were available simultaneously, muscimol stimulated feeding of both diets to the same degree. Muscimol elicited a robust increase in the consumption of sucrose solution. However, no effect of muscimol was demonstrated  for water, saline, or saccharin intake. These findings provide evidence for a selective role for GABA-sensitive neurons in the medial accumbens shell in the regulation of ingestive behavior and further suggest that GABA(A) receptors in this region do not modulate palatability, macronutrient selection, or rewarding properties of food.", "9475619": "The corticostriatal pathway is believed to utilize the excitatory amino acid glutamate as its transmitter, and the striatum contains high levels of all glutamate receptor subtypes. It has recently been demonstrated that blockade of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate glutamate receptors in the medial part of the accumbens, corresponding to the medial shell subregion, results in a pronounced feeding response. In order to more precisely localize this response, a microinfusion mapping study was conducted. Bilateral microinfusions of 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX, 0, 50, 250, 750 ng/0.5 microl), an antagonist that blocks AMPA and kainate receptors, were carried out in eight striatal subregions in different groups of animals. In non-deprived rats, food intake (normal chow), feeding duration, and several other behavioral measures were assessed during a 30 min test session. DNQX significantly and potently enhanced food intake when injected into the accumbens shell, but not into any other region examined, including accumbens core, anterior dorsal, posterior dorsal, ventromedial, dorsomedial, and ventrolateral striatum. The most sensitive site within the accumbens was found to be the posterior aspects of the shell, in which the lowest dose (50 ng DNQX) augmented feeding. These results suggest that a circumscribed region within the nucleus accumbens has a unique role in the control of feeding. It is postulated that removal of tonic excitatory inputs to this region with DNQX results in disinhibition of brain circuits critical for ingestive behavior.", "19457367": "Anhedonia, the reduced propensity to experience pleasure, is a promising endophenotype and vulnerability factor for several psychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. In the present study, we used resting electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and volumetric analyses to probe putative associations between anhedonia and individual differences in key nodes of the brain's reward system in a non-clinical sample. We found that anhedonia, but not other symptoms of depression or anxiety, was correlated with reduced nucleus accumbens (NAcc) responses to rewards (gains in a monetary incentive delay task), reduced NAcc volume, and increased resting delta  current density (i.e., decreased resting activity) in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), an area previously implicated in positive subjective experience. In addition, NAcc reward responses were inversely associated with rACC resting delta activity, supporting the hypothesis that delta might be lawfully related to activity within the brain's reward circuit. Taken together, these results help elucidate the neural basis of anhedonia and strengthen the argument for anhedonia as an endophenotype for depression.", "19325164": "The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has been one of the most enduring ideas  in psychiatry. Initially, the emphasis was on a role of hyperdopaminergia in the  etiology of schizophrenia (version I), but it was subsequently reconceptualized to specify subcortical hyperdopaminergia with prefrontal hypodopaminergia (version II). However, these hypotheses focused too narrowly on dopamine itself,  conflated psychosis and schizophrenia, and predated advances in the genetics, molecular biology, and imaging research in schizophrenia. Since version II, there have been over 6700 articles about dopamine and schizophrenia. We selectively review these data to provide an overview of the 5 critical streams of new evidence: neurochemical imaging studies, genetic evidence, findings on environmental risk factors, research into the extended phenotype, and animal studies. We synthesize this evidence into a new dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia-version III: the final common pathway. This hypothesis seeks to be  comprehensive in providing a framework that links risk factors, including pregnancy and obstetric complications, stress and trauma, drug use, and genes, to increased presynaptic striatal dopaminergic function. It explains how a complex array of pathological, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging,  and other findings, such as frontotemporal structural and functional abnormalities and cognitive impairments, may converge neurochemically to cause psychosis through aberrant salience and lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The hypothesis has one major implication for treatment approaches. Current treatments are acting downstream of the critical neurotransmitter abnormality. Future drug development and research into etiopathogenesis should focus on identifying and manipulating the upstream factors that converge on the dopaminergic funnel point.", "21471379": "During abstinence, memories of drug-associated cues persist for many months, and  exposure to these cues often provokes relapse to drug use. The mechanisms underlying the maintenance of these memories are unknown. A constitutively active atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isozyme, protein kinase M \u03b6 (PKM\u03b6), is required for maintenance of spatial memory, conditioned taste aversion, and other memory forms. We used conditioned place preference (CPP) and conditioned place aversion  (CPA) procedures to study the role of nucleus accumbens PKM\u03b6 in the maintenance of drug reward and aversion memories in rats. Morphine CPP training (10 mg/kg, 4  pairings) increased PKM\u03b6 levels in accumbens core but not shell. Injections of the PKM\u03b6 inhibitor \u03b6 inhibitory peptide (ZIP) into accumbens core but not shell after CPP training blocked morphine CPP expression for up to 14 d after injections. This effect was mimicked by the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, which inhibits PKM\u03b6, but not by the conventional and novel PKC inhibitor staurosporine, which does not effectively inhibit PKM\u03b6. ZIP injections into accumbens core after training also blocked the expression of cocaine (10 mg/kg) and high-fat food CPP  but had no effect on CPA induced by naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. Accumbens core injections of Tat-GluR2(3Y), which inhibits GluR2-dependent AMPA receptor endocytosis, prevented the impairment in morphine CPP induced by local ZIP injections, indicating that the persistent effect of PKM\u03b6 is on GluR2-containing AMPA receptors. Results indicate that PKM\u03b6 activity in accumbens core is a critical cellular substrate for the maintenance of memories of relapse-provoking reward cues during prolonged abstinence periods.", "26844834": "Dendritic spines are the sites of most excitatory synapses in the CNS, and opposing alterations in the synaptic structure of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of  the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a primary brain reward region, are seen at early versus late time points after cocaine administration. Here we investigate the time-dependent molecular and biochemical processes that regulate this bidirectional synaptic structural plasticity of NAc MSNs and associated changes in cocaine reward in response to chronic cocaine exposure. Our findings reveal key roles for the bidirectional synaptic expression of the Rap1b small GTPase and an associated local synaptic protein translation network in this process. The transcriptional mechanisms and pathway-specific inputs to NAc that regulate Rap1b expression are also characterized. Collectively, these findings provide a precise mechanism by which nuclear to synaptic interactions induce \"metaplasticity\" in NAc MSNs, and we reveal the specific effects of this plasticity on reward behavior in a brain circuit-specific manner.", "21867882": "Substance abuse increases an individual's vulnerability to stress-related illnesses, which is presumably mediated by drug-induced neural adaptations that alter subsequent responses to stress. Here, we identify repressive histone methylation in nucleus accumbens (NAc), an important brain reward region, as a key mechanism linking cocaine exposure to increased stress vulnerability. Repeated cocaine administration prior to subchronic social defeat stress potentiated depressive-like behaviors in mice through decreased levels of histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation in NAc. Cre-mediated reduction of the histone methyltransferase, G9a, in NAc promoted increased susceptibility to social stress, similar to that observed with repeated cocaine. Conversely, G9a overexpression in NAc after repeated cocaine protected mice from the consequences of subsequent stress. This resilience was mediated, in part, through repression of BDNF-TrkB-CREB signaling, which was induced after repeated cocaine or stress.  Identifying such common regulatory mechanisms may aid in the development of new therapies for addiction and depression.", "23986236": "Drug-associated cues can acquire powerful motivational control over the behavior  of addicts, and can contribute to relapse via multiple, dissociable mechanisms. Most preclinical models of relapse focus on only one of these mechanisms: the ability of drug cues to reinforce drug-seeking actions following a period of extinction training. However, in addicts, drug cues typically do not follow seeking actions; they precede them. They often produce relapse by evoking a conditioned motivational state (\"wanting\" or \"craving\") that instigates and/or invigorates drug-seeking behavior. Here we used a conflict-based relapse model to ask whether individual variation in the propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues predicts variation in the ability of a cocaine cue to produce conditioned motivation (craving) for cocaine. Following self-administration training, responding was curtailed by requiring rats to cross an electrified floor to take cocaine. The subsequent response-independent presentation of a cocaine-associated cue was sufficient to reinstate drug-seeking behavior, despite the continued presence of the adverse consequence. Importantly, there were large individual differences in the motivational properties of the cocaine cue, which were predicted by variation in the propensity to attribute incentive salience to a food cue. Finally, a dopamine antagonist injected into the nucleus accumbens core attenuated, and amphetamine facilitated, cue-evoked cocaine seeking, implicating dopamine signaling in cocaine cue-evoked craving. These data provide a promising preclinical approach for studying sources of individual variation in susceptibility to relapse due to conditioned craving and  implicate mesolimbic dopamine in this process.", "16443285": "Mesostriatal dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and striatal cholinergic neurons (tonically active neurons, TANs) participate in signalling the behavioural or reward-related significance of stimuli in the environment. An antagonistic balance between dopamine (DA) and ACh is well known to regulate postsynaptic signal integration in the striatum. Recent findings have revealed additional presynaptic ACh-DA interactions of previously unappreciated sophistication. Striatal ACh acts presynaptically to polarize powerfully how opposing DAN activities are transduced into DA release. Furthermore, characteristic reward-related activities of TANs and DANs are temporally coincident but differently variant with reward probability. Reward-related DA signals could therefore be governed by the concomitant activity in TANs. This article discusses the dynamic implications for DA signalling when these phenomena act in concert. TAN pauses might powerfully enhance the contrast, or salience, of DA signals offered by reward-related bursts, and even by reward omission-related pauses, in  DANs. Through such mechanisms, TAN-DAN interactions would be functionally cooperative.", "17408758": "Dopamine shapes a wide variety of psychomotor functions. This is mainly accomplished by modulating cortical and thalamic glutamatergic signals impinging  upon principal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the striatum. Several lines of evidence suggest that dopamine D1 receptor signaling enhances dendritic excitability and glutamatergic signaling in striatonigral MSNs, whereas D2 receptor signaling exerts the opposite effect in striatopallidal MSNs. The functional antagonism between these two major striatal dopamine receptors extends to the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Recent studies, using transgenic mice in which cells express D1 and D2 receptors, have uncovered unappreciated differences between MSNs that shape glutamatergic signaling and the influence of  DA on synaptic plasticity. These studies have also shown that long-term alterations in dopamine signaling produce profound and cell-type-specific reshaping of corticostriatal connectivity and function.", "15464136": "The nucleus accumbens (Acb) is a key neural substrate underlying goal-directed behaviors for both drugs of abuse as well as 'natural' rewards. Here, I review electrophysiological and electrochemical studies completed in our laboratory that examined Acb cell firing and rapid dopamine signaling during behaviors directed toward reward procurement. Electrophysiological studies are reviewed showing that Acb neurons exhibit patterned discharges relative to operant responding for intravenous self-administration of cocaine versus 'natural' reinforcement in rodents. Importantly, subsequent studies showed that discrete subsets of Acb neurons are selectively activated during multiple schedules for a natural reward  (water or food) versus cocaine self-administration. These later findings indicate that separate neural circuits selectively process information about goal-directed behaviors for cocaine versus natural reward. In addition, recent findings are reviewed showing that reinforcer selective firing of Acb neurons is not a direct  consequence of chronic drug exposure. Next, electrochemical studies are summarized that used fast scan cyclic voltammetry to measure rapid (subsecond) changes in dopamine in the Acb during cocaine self-administration as well as 'natural' reinforcement in rodents. These findings are considered with respect to the role of dopamine in modulating the activity of Acb neurons that encode goal-directed behaviors, the functional organization of the Acb on a microcircuit level, and proposed directions for future studies.", "23664810": "In recent years, neuroscientists have produced profound conceptual and mechanistic advances on the neurocircuitry of reward and substance use disorders. Here, we will provide a brief review of intracranial drug self-administration and optogenetic self-stimulation studies that identified brain regions and neurotransmitter systems involved in drug- and reward-related behaviors. Also discussed is a theoretical framework that helps to understand the functional properties of the circuitry involved in these behaviors. The circuitry appears to be homeostatically regulated and mediate anticipatory processes that regulate behavioral interaction with the environment in response to salient stimuli. That  is, abused drugs or, at least, some may act on basic motivation and mood processes, regulating behavior-environment interaction. Optogenetics and related  technologies have begun to uncover detailed circuit mechanisms linking key brain  regions in which abused drugs act for rewarding effects.

The error signal is bidirectional, reflects well the higher order prediction error described by temporal difference learning models, is compatible  with model-free and model-based reinforcement learning, reports the subjective rather than physical reward value during temporal discounting and reflects subjective stimulus perception rather than physical stimulus aspects. Dopamine activations are primarily driven by reward, and to some extent risk, whereas punishment and salience have only limited activating effects when appropriate controls are respected. The signal is homogeneous in terms of time course but heterogeneous in many other aspects. It is essential for synaptic plasticity and  a range of behavioural learning situations.", "22153370": "Currently there is no general approach for achieving specific optogenetic control of genetically defined cell types in rats, which provide a powerful experimental  system for numerous established neurophysiological and behavioral paradigms. To overcome this challenge we have generated genetically restricted recombinase-driver rat lines suitable for driving gene expression in specific cell types, expressing Cre recombinase under the control of large genomic regulatory regions (200-300 kb). Multiple tyrosine hydroxylase (Th)::Cre and choline acetyltransferase (Chat)::Cre lines were produced that exhibited specific opsin expression in targeted cell types. We additionally developed methods for utilizing optogenetic tools in freely moving rats and leveraged these technologies to clarify the causal relationship between dopamine (DA) neuron firing and positive reinforcement, observing that optical stimulation of DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of Th::Cre rats is sufficient to support vigorous intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). These studies complement existing targeting approaches by extending the generalizability of optogenetics to traditionally non-genetically-tractable but vital animal models.", "19162544": "In recent years significant progress has been made delineating the psychological  components of reward and their underlying neural mechanisms. Here we briefly highlight findings on three dissociable psychological components of reward: 'liking' (hedonic impact), 'wanting' (incentive salience), and learning (predictive associations and cognitions). A better understanding of the components of reward, and their neurobiological substrates, may help in devising  improved treatments for disorders of mood and motivation, ranging from depression to eating disorders, drug addiction, and related compulsive pursuits of rewards.", "12185211": "The development of addiction involves a transition from casual to compulsive patterns of drug use. This transition to addiction is accompanied by many drug-induced changes in the brain and associated changes in psychological functions. In this article we present a critical analysis of the major theoretical explanations of how drug-induced alterations in psychological function might cause a transition to addiction. These include: (a) the traditional hedonic view that drug pleasure and subsequent unpleasant withdrawal  symptoms are the chief causes of addiction; (b) the view that addiction is due to aberrant learning, especially the development of strong stimulus-response habits; (c) our incentive-sensitization view, which suggests that sensitization of a neural system that attributes incentive salience causes compulsive motivation or  \"wanting\" to take addictive drugs; and (d) the idea that dysfunction of frontal cortical systems, which normally regulate decision making and inhibitory control  over behavior, leads to impaired judgment and impulsivity in addicts.", "16473939": "Repeated association of drugs of abuse with context leads to long-lasting behavioral responses that reflect reward-controlled learning and participate in the establishment of addiction. Reactivation of consolidated memories is known to produce a reconsolidation process during which memories undergo a labile state. We investigated whether reexposure to drugs had similar effects. Cocaine administration activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the striatum, and ERK activation is required for the acquisition of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). When mice previously conditioned for cocaine-place preference were reexposed to cocaine in the drug-paired compartment after systemic administration of SL327, an inhibitor of ERK activation, CPP response was abolished 24 h later. This procedure also abolished the phosphorylation of ERK and glutamate receptor-1 observed in the ventral and dorsal striatum, 24 h later, during CPP test. Erasure of CPP by SL327 required the combination of cocaine administration and drug-paired context and did not result from enhanced extinction. Similarly, reexposure to morphine in the presence of SL327 long-lastingly abolished response of previously learned morphine-CPP. The effects of SL327 on cocaine- or morphine-CPP were reproduced by protein synthesis inhibition. In contrast, protein synthesis inhibition did not alter previously acquired locomotor sensitization to cocaine. Our findings show that an established CPP can be disrupted when reactivation associates both the conditioned context and drug administration. This process involves ERK, and systemic treatment preventing ERK activation during reexposure erases the previously learned behavioral response. These results suggest potential therapeutic strategies to explore in the context of addiction.", "1632593": "Repetitive use of psychoactive drugs produces a variety of learned behaviors. These can be classified in the laboratory according to an operant/classical paradigm, but in vivo the two types of learning overlap. The classically conditioned responses produced by drugs are complex and bi-directional. There has been progress in classifying and predicting the types of conditioned responses, but little is known of mechanisms. New techniques for understanding brain function such as micro-dialysis probes in animals and advanced imaging techniques (PET and SPECT) in human subjects may be utilized in conditioning paradigms to \"open the black box.\" Because the existence of conditioned responses in drug users is now well established, clinical studies have been instituted to determine whether modification of conditioned responses can influence clinical outcome. A recently completed study in cocaine addicts has produced evidence that outcome can be improved by a passive extinction technique over an 8-week outpatient treatment program.", "20513432": "Genome-scale studies have revealed extensive, cell type-specific colocalization of transcription factors, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions  associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which  drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell  types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs.", "16541082": "The cocaine-addicted phenotype can be modeled in rats based on individual differences in preferred levels of cocaine intake and a propensity for relapse in withdrawal. These cocaine-taking and -seeking behaviors are strongly but differentially regulated by postsynaptic D1 and D2 receptors in the mesolimbic dopamine system. Thus, we determined whether addiction-related differences in cocaine self-administration would be related to differential sensitivity in functional D1 and D2 receptor responses. Using a population of 40 outbred Sprague-Dawley rats trained to self-administer cocaine for 3 weeks, we found that animals with higher preferred levels of cocaine intake exhibited a vertical and rightward shift in the self-administration dose-response function, and were more  resistant to extinction from cocaine self-administration, similar to phenotypic changes reported in other models of cocaine addiction. After 3 weeks of withdrawal from cocaine self-administration, high intake rats were subsensitive to the ability of the D1 agonist SKF 81297 to inhibit cocaine-seeking behavior elicited by cocaine priming, but supersensitive to cocaine seeking triggered by the D2 agonist quinpirole, when compared to low intake rats. Additionally, high intake rats developed profound increases in locomotor responses to D2 receptor challenge from early to late withdrawal times, whereas low intake rats developed  increased responsiveness to D1 receptor challenge. In a second experiment, responses to the mixed D1/D2 agonist apomorphine and the NMDA glutamate receptor  antagonist MK-801 failed to differ between low and high intake rats. These findings suggest that cocaine addiction is related specifically to differential alterations in functional D1 and D2 receptors and their ability to modulate cocaine-seeking behavior.", "25242218": "Striatal dopamine transmission underlies numerous goal-directed behaviors. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are a major target of dopamine in the striatum. However, as  dopamine does not directly evoke a synaptic event in MSNs, the time course of dopamine signaling in these cells remains unclear. To examine how dopamine release activates D2-receptors on MSNs, G protein activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK2; Kir 3.2) channels were virally overexpressed in the striatum, and the resulting outward currents were used as a sensor of D2-receptor activation. Electrical and optogenetic stimulation of dopamine terminals evoked robust D2-receptor inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in GIRK2-expressing MSNs that occurred in under a second. Evoked D2-IPSCs could be driven by repetitive stimulation and were not occluded by background dopamine tone. Together, the results indicate that D2-receptors on MSNs exhibit functional low affinity and suggest that striatal D2-receptors can encode both tonic and phasic  dopamine signals.", "24893316": "In comparison to men, women exhibit enhanced responsiveness to the stimulating and addictive properties of cocaine. A growing body of evidence implicates the steroid hormone estradiol in mediating this sex difference, yet the mechanisms underlying estradiol enhancement of behavioral responses to cocaine in females are not known. Recently, we have found that estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) functionally couples with the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) to mediate the effects of estradiol on both cellular activation as well as dendritic spine plasticity in brain regions involved in cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization. Thus, we sought to determine whether mGluR5 activation is required for the facilitative effects of estradiol on locomotor responses to cocaine. To test this hypothesis, ovariectomized (OVX) female rats were tested for locomotor  activity on the first and fifth days of daily systemic injections of cocaine. For the 2 days prior to each locomotor test, animals were injected with the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (or vehicle) and estradiol (or oil). MPEP treatment blocked the facilitative effects of estradiol on cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization, without affecting acute responses to cocaine or the inhibitory actions of estradiol on weight gain. Considered together, these data indicate that mGluR5 activation is critical for the actions of estradiol on cocaine-induced behavioral sensitization.", "15920500": "Men and women differ in their response to cocaine, and a woman's response varies  with the menstrual cycle. For example, women have greater subjective responses to cocaine in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle when estradiol is predominant, than they do during the luteal phase when both estradiol and progesterone are elevated. Similarly, female rats show significantly more cocaine-induced locomotor behavior and cocaine self-administration during behavioral estrus, shortly after estradiol peaks, than during other stages of the cycle, and estradiol administration to ovariectomized (OVX) females enhances the  acquisition of cocaine self-administration. The purpose of this study was to expand upon these findings by studying the effects of progesterone administration to females, and estradiol administration to males, on acquisition of cocaine self-administration. We report here that there are both sex differences in and effects of circulating ovarian hormones on acquisition of cocaine self-administration. We demonstrate that although estradiol administration enhances acquisition of cocaine self-administration in OVX female rats, concurrent administration of progesterone with estradiol inhibits this effect of  estradiol. In a separate experiment, we demonstrate that estradiol administration does not enhance acquisition of cocaine self-administration in castrated male rats. We conclude that (1) there is a sex difference in the effects of estradiol  on cocaine self-administration: it facilitates acquisition in female, but not male rats; and that (2) in females concurrent progesterone treatment counteracts  the facilitory effect of estradiol on cocaine self-administration.", "10322190": "The circuitry mediating the integration of reward perception and adaptive behavioral responses has been further refined. Recent developments indicate that  the nucleus accumbens has a primary role in motivational circuitry, whereas afferents to the nucleus accumbens, in part, subserve distinct functions. Dopaminergic afferents serve to signal changes in rewarding stimuli, whereas glutamatergic input from the amygdala serves to cue behavior to conditioned reward, and afferents from the prefrontal cortex integrate information from short-term memory into behavioral responses.", "21264647": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been implicated in mediating different forms of decision making in humans and animals. In the present study, we observed that inactivation of the rat NAc, via infusion of GABA agonists, reduced preference for a large/risky option and increased response latencies on a probabilistic discounting task. Discrete inactivations of the NAc shell and core revealed further differences between these regions in mediating choice and response latencies, respectively. The effect on choice was attributable to reduced win-stay performance (i.e., choosing risky after a being rewarded for a risky choice on a preceding trial). Moreover, NAc inactivation altered choice only when the large/risky option had greater long-term value, in terms of the amount of food that could be obtained over multiple trials relative to the small/certain option. Inactivation of the NAc or the shell subregion also slightly reduced preference for larger rewards on a reward magnitude discrimination. Thus, the NAc seems to play a small role in biasing choice toward larger rewards, but its contribution to behavior is amplified when delivery of these rewards is uncertain, helping to direct response selection toward more favorable outcomes.", "20452572": "BACKGROUND: Optimal decision-making requires that organisms correctly evaluate both the costs and benefits of potential choices. Dopamine transmission within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been heavily implicated in reward-learning and decision-making, but it is unclear how dopamine release might contribute to decisions that involve costs. METHODS: Cost-based decision-making was examined in rats trained to associate visual cues with either immediate or delayed rewards (delay manipulation) or low-effort or high-effort rewards (effort manipulation). After training, dopamine concentration within the NAc was monitored on a rapid time scale with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. RESULTS: Animals exhibited a preference for immediate or low-effort rewards over  delayed or high-effort rewards of equal magnitude. Reward-predictive cues but not response execution or reward delivery evoked increases in NAc dopamine concentration. When only one response option was available, cue-evoked dopamine release reflected the value of the future reward, with larger increases in dopamine signaling higher-value rewards. In contrast, when both options were presented simultaneously, dopamine signaled the better of two options, regardless of the future choice. CONCLUSIONS: Phasic dopamine signals in the NAc reflect two different types of reward cost and encode potential rather than chosen value under choice situations.", "14599436": "The prefrontal cortex in rats can be distinguished anatomically from other frontal cortical areas both in terms of cytoarchitectonic characteristics and neural connectivity, and it can be further subdivided into subterritories on the  basis of such criteria. Functionally, the prefrontal cortex of rats has been implicated in working memory, attention, response initiation and management of autonomic control and emotion. In humans, dysfunction of prefrontal cortical areas with which the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat is most likely comparable is related to psychopathology including schizophrenia, sociopathy, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and drug abuse. Recent literature points to the relevance of conducting a functional analysis of prefrontal subregions and supports the idea that the area of the medial prefrontal cortex in rats is characterized by its own functional heterogeneity, which may be related to neuroanatomical and neurochemical dissociations. The present review covers recent findings with the intent of correlating these distinct functional differences in the dorso-ventral axis of the rat medial prefrontal cortex with anatomical and neurochemical patterns.", "10700608": "Double-immunolabelling experiments for the combinations, calretinin (CR)-calbindin, CR-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and calbindin-TH, were performed in  rhesus monkeys to compare the chemical organization of the nucleus accumbens (ACC) in primates and rodents. Additionally, the soma sizes and numbers of primary dendrites of cholinergic neurons in the subregions of ACC were compared with those of caudate-putamen. Our findings subserve the shell-core concept also  in the primate ACC, as like in the rat, CR immunoreactivity (-ir) due to intense  neuropil labelling is very strong in the shell of rhesus monkey, but poor in the  core. The staining intensity of this marker decreases in dorsoventral direction.  An almost complementary pattern was noted in sections of the monkey ACC immunostained for both calbindin and TH. The cholinergic interneurons of the nucleus caudatus-putamen are clearly distinguished from those of the ACC and insula Calleja magna by their much bigger soma sizes and higher numbers of primary dendrites. Cholinergic neurons of the shell were found to be slightly, but significantly, larger than those of the core that also subserves subdivision  of the primate ACC into shell and core. A low proportion of tyrosine-hydroxylase-immunostained cells, already previously described below the  rostral ACC, co-expressed CR but not calbindin. A CR-immunoreactive neuronal population, intermingled with these cells, extends as a stripe medially to the ACC along the septal part of corpus callosum into the lateral septal area. The presumed origin of CR-immunoreactive fibres in the shell of ACC is discussed.", "2418171": "The hippocampal input to the nucleus accumbens was studied by correlative electrophysiological and anatomical techniques in acutely prepared rabbits. Field and extracellular unitary potentials were recorded in the nucleus accumbens following ipsilateral fimbria stimulation. Analysis of the components of the field response was based on the relevant correlations with extracellular unitary  activity. The cellular types that are the recipients of the hippocampal projection were determined by combined intracellular horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and Golgi analyses. The distribution of the hippocampal input was determined by combined field potential and current source density analyses. It was found that the ipsilateral fimbria projection was distributed to the dorsal two-thirds of the nucleus, with the projection being heaviest in the more caudal portions of the nucleus. The negative (N) component of the field response was studied by correlating its behavior with the appropriate extracellular unitary recordings. It was concluded that the N-component represented an envelope of monosynaptically activated action potentials. The positive (P) component of the field response throughout the nucleus accumbens was studied pharmacologically with the iontophoretic administration of bicuculline. The P-components, in both the dorsal and ventral regions of the nucleus, were diminished by bicuculline application, indicating that this potential results from the activation of gamma-aminobutyric  acid (GABA) mechanisms. The cell populations that are the targets for the hippocampal projections were studied by the technique of intracellular staining with HRP. These results were correlated with the findings of a Golgi analysis. Two distinct cell types were found to respond in a monosynaptic manner to ipsilateral fimbria stimulation. The most common of the two were the small-to medium-sized spiny neurons, and they were distributed throughout the nucleus. These cells have a spherical dendritic arrangement. The second, and most distinctive, of the cell types were the large aspiny neurons. These cells were distributed medially and caudally in the nucleus. Two of the outstanding features of these cells were the expanse of their dendritic domains and the fact that axons originated from relatively remote portions of the dendrites.", "17318502": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The idea that nucleus accumbens (Acb) dopamine transmission contributes to the neural mediation of reward, at least in a general sense, has achieved wide acceptance. Nevertheless, debate remains over the precise nature of dopamine's role in reward and even over the nature of reward itself. In the present article, evidence is reviewed from studies of food intake, feeding microstructure, instrumental responding for food reinforcement, and dopamine efflux associated with feeding, which suggests that reward processing in the Acb is best understood as an interaction among distinct processes coded by discrete neurotransmitter systems. RESULTS: In agreement with several theories of Acb dopamine function, it is proposed here that allocation of motor effort in seeking food or food-associated  conditioned stimuli can be dissociated from computations relevant to the hedonic  evaluation of food during the consummatory act. The former appears to depend upon Acb dopamine transmission and the latter upon striatal opioid peptide release. Moreover, dopamine transmission may play a role in 'stamping in' associations between motor acts and goal attainment and perhaps also neural representations corresponding to rewarding outcomes. Finally, evidence is reviewed that amino acid transmission specifically in the Acb shell acts as a central 'circuit breaker' to flexibly enable or terminate the consummatory act, via descending connections to hypothalamic feeding control systems. CONCLUSIONS: The heuristic framework outlined above may help explain why dopamine-compromising manipulations that strongly diminish instrumental goal-seeking behaviors leave consummatory activity relatively unaffected.", "17031710": "BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE: More than two decades ago, Wise proposed his \"anhedonia hypothesis\" to explain the role of dopamine in motivated behaviors. The hypothesis posits that dopamine mediates the pleasure experienced by reward obtainment. However, some experimental findings have contested this hypothesis and several authors have proposed alternative functions for dopamine with regard  to motivation. Brain dopamine has been suggested to rather code for the preparatory aspects of behavior, while brain opioids seem to mediate the perception of the hedonic properties of rewards. OBJECTIVES: The main goal of this review is to reexamine dopamine and opioids involvement in feeding when different aspects such as the anticipatory, motivational and consummatory components of this behavior are taken into account, but also when the physiologic state of the organism and the palatability of the food are considered. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the data presented point out for an implication of dopamine in the anticipatory/preparatory aspects of feeding more than on the motivational and consummatory aspects. However, dopamine involvement  in the anticipatory/preparatory component of feeding seems specifically related to very relevant stimuli, such as highly palatable foods. On the other hand, our  data, as well as those present in the literature, strongly suggest a role for opioids in food intake through their modulation of the hedonic perception of food. As a consequence, opioids are involved in those aspects of motivation driven by food palatability rather than by food homeostatic need.", "24120118": "BACKGROUND: Cocaine addiction is characterized by a progressive increase in drug  intake and a persistent craving for the drug during prolonged abstinence. Whether these two prominent features of cocaine addiction are related to each other and are mediated by similar or different neuronal processes is currently unknown. METHODS: Rats were first allowed to self-administer cocaine under long-access (6-hour) conditions to induce escalation of cocaine intake. Self-administration sessions were designed to measure both drug seeking and drug taking. After escalation, rats underwent a 1-month period of forced abstinence after which they were re-exposed to cocaine to induce re-escalation of cocaine intake. In vivo electrophysiologic recordings were conducted in the core and shell subregions of  the nucleus accumbens (NAc) during cocaine intake escalation, after abstinence and during re-escalation. RESULTS: After abstinence, escalated levels of cocaine taking decreased toward pre-escalation levels, whereas cocaine seeking increased persistently. These opposite postabstinence changes were uncorrelated. At the neuronal level, the postabstinence decrease in cocaine taking was correlated with a normalization of  depressed neuronal activity in the NAc shell that had developed during escalation of cocaine intake. In contrast, the incubation-like increase in cocaine seeking was selectively correlated with a persistent increase in the proportion of neurons in the NAc core that phasically fire during cocaine seeking. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that cocaine taking and cocaine seeking evolve differently during abstinence from extended drug use and depend on dissociable neuronal processes in different subregions of the nucleus accumbens.", "28053327": "Dopamine-releasing neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have central roles in reward-related and goal-directed behaviours. VTA dopamine-releasing neurons are heterogeneous in their afferent and efferent connectivity and, in some cases, release GABA or glutamate in addition to dopamine. Recent findings show that motivational signals arising from the VTA can also be carried by non-dopamine-releasing projection neurons, which have their own specific connectivity. Both dopamine-releasing and non-dopamine-releasing VTA neurons integrate afferent signals with local inhibitory or excitatory inputs to generate particular output firing patterns. Various individual inputs, outputs and local connections have been shown to be sufficient to generate reward- or aversion-related behaviour, indicative of the impressive contribution of this small population of neurons to behaviour.", "23495790": "Pavlovian cues [conditioned stimulus (CS+)] often trigger intense motivation to pursue and consume related reward [unconditioned stimulus (UCS)]. But cues do not always trigger the same intensity of motivation. Encountering a reward cue can be more tempting on some occasions than on others. What makes the same cue trigger more intense motivation to pursue reward on a particular encounter? The answer may be the level of incentive salience ('wanting') that is dynamically generated  by mesocorticolimbic brain systems, influenced especially by dopamine and opioid  neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) at that moment. We tested the ability of dopamine stimulation (by amphetamine microinjection) vs. mu opioid stimulation [by d-Ala, nMe-Phe, Glyol-enkephalin (DAMGO) microinjection] of either the core or shell of the NAc to amplify cue-triggered levels of motivation to pursue sucrose reward, measured with a Pavlovian-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) procedure, a relatively pure assay of incentive salience. Cue-triggered 'wanting' in PIT was enhanced by amphetamine or DAMGO microinjections equally, and also equally at nearly all sites throughout the entire core and medial shell (except for a small far-rostral strip of shell). NAc dopamine/opioid stimulations specifically enhanced CS+ ability to trigger phasic peaks of 'wanting' to obtain  UCS, without altering baseline efforts when CS+ was absent. We conclude that dopamine/opioid stimulation throughout nearly the entire NAc can causally amplify the reactivity of mesocorticolimbic circuits, and so magnify incentive salience or phasic UCS 'wanting' peaks triggered by a CS+. Mesolimbic amplification of incentive salience may explain why a particular cue encounter can become irresistibly tempting, even when previous encounters were successfully resisted before.", "21613494": "The midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is implicated in motivation and reinforcement. A significant number of NAc  medium spiny neurons (MSNs) project back to the VTA, although the nature of this  projection is essentially unknown. For example, do NAc MSNs directly target accumbens-projecting dopamine neurons and do they act via the GABA(A) or GABA(B)  receptor? To address these issues, we expressed the light-sensitive channel rhodopsin-2 in the rat NAc and made electrophysiological recordings from VTA neurons ex vivo. We found that the NAc directly targets non-dopaminergic VTA neurons, including some that project back to the NAc. These MSN GABAergic terminals are opioid sensitive and act via GABA(A) receptors.", "21427783": "Mesostriatal dopaminergic neurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons participate in signaling the motivational significance of environmental stimuli and regulate striatal plasticity. Dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) have potent interactions within the striatum at multiple levels that include presynaptic regulation of neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic effects in target cells (including ACh neurons). These interactions may be highly variable given the dynamic changes in the firing activities of parent DA and ACh neurons.  Here, we consider how striatal ACh released from cholinergic interneurons acting  at both nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors powerfully modulates DA transmission. This ACh-DA interaction varies in a manner that depends on the frequency of presynaptic activation, and will thus strongly influence how DA synapses convey discrete changes in DA neuron activity that are known to signal events of motivational salience. Furthermore, this ACh modulation of DA transmission within striatum occurs via different profiles of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in caudate-putamen compared to nucleus accumbens, which may  ultimately enable region-specific targeting of striatal function.", "12907414": "The nucleus accumbens shell region (sNAcc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are two major nodes in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, which mediates reward for various survival behaviors, including feeding. Opioids increase and maintain food intake when injected peripherally and centrally. Opioids in the VTA cause increased release of dopamine in the sNAcc, and when injected into either site, cause an increase in food intake. Animals in this study were double cannulated in the VTA and in the sNAcc and injected with various combinations of naltrexone (NTX) (2.5, 5, and 25 microg/side) and Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-(Me)Phe-Gly-ol (DAMGO) (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 5 nmol/side) in both sites. DAMGO was found to dose dependently increase intake to an equal extent when injected into either site. DAMGO-induced  increases in food intake when injected into the VTA were blocked to control levels with the highest dose of NTX injected bilaterally into the sNAcc; however, increases in intake when injected into the sNAcc were blocked only partially by the highest dose of NTX injected bilaterally into the VTA. These results indicate opioid-opioid communication between the two sites; however, the communication may be quite indirect, requiring other sites and transmitters to elicit a change in behavior.", "3026557": "The nucleus accumbens (ACC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), two areas believed  to subserve reinforcement and increases in locomotor activity produced by opioid  microinjections, were examined for their involvement in opioid-produced changes in ingestive behavior. Opioids were infused bilaterally, and food and water intakes were measured for 1 h thereafter. Different morphine doses were administered and, with placements in globus pallidus and lateral ventricles as controls for diffusion, it was found that only ACC and VTA microinjections (0.1-10 nmol) produced dose-related increases in food intake. In both the ACC and VTA low doses of morphine also produced increases in water intake while in ACC high doses produced a decrease. Administration of morphine and an enkephalin analogue (Tyr-D-Met-Gly-Phe(4-NO2)-Pro-NH2) at different depths in the ACC indicated that the increase in food intake occurred at a site separate from that  of the decrease in water intake. Using levorphanol, dextrorphan and morphine mixed with naloxone, it was shown that the effects were due to activation of opioid receptors. Additional experiments demonstrated that food intake is increased by ACC morphine under different levels of deprivation, with different times of testing and with availabilities of various goal objects in addition to food. The effect also did not appear to undergo development of tolerance or sensitization. It was concluded that there are sites in the ACC and VTA where increased activity of endogenous opioid peptide systems reliably increase food intake and it was hypothesized that these sites may contribute to changes in ingestive behavior after systemic morphine administration. Also, together with other effects produced by opioid microinjections into the ACC and VTA, the present findings suggest that increased opioid activity in these areas produce a  pattern of behaviors similar to that produced in normal animals by food conditioned stimuli.", "25698746": "Previous studies have shown that chronic cocaine administration induces SIRT1, a  Class III histone deacetylase, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region, and that such induction influences the gene regulation and place conditioning effects of cocaine. To determine the mechanisms by which SIRT1 mediates cocaine-induced plasticity in NAc, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq), 1 d after 7 daily cocaine (20 mg/kg) or saline injections, to map SIRT1 binding genome-wide in mouse NAc. Our unbiased results revealed two modes of SIRT1 action. First, despite its induction in NAc, chronic cocaine causes depletion of SIRT1 from most affected gene promoters in concert with enrichment of H4K16ac (itself a deacetylation target of SIRT1), which is associated with increased expression of these genes. Second, we deduced the forkhead transcription factor (FOXO) family to be a downstream mechanism through which SIRT1 regulates cocaine action. We proceeded to demonstrate that SIRT1 induction causes the deacetylation and activation of FOXO3a in NAc, which leads to the induction of several known FOXO3a gene targets  in other systems. Finally, we directly establish a role for FOXO3a in promoting cocaine-elicited behavioral responses by use of viral-mediated gene transfer: we  show that overexpressing FOXO3a in NAc enhances cocaine place conditioning. The discovery of these two actions of SIRT1 in NAc in the context of behavioral adaptations to cocaine represents an important step forward in advancing our understanding of the molecular adaptations underlying cocaine action.", "24758366": "BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence supports a role for altered gene expression in mediating the lasting effects of cocaine on the brain, and recent work has demonstrated the involvement of chromatin modifications in these alterations. However, all such studies to date have been restricted by their reliance on microarray technologies that have intrinsic limitations. RESULTS: We use next generation sequencing methods, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq for RNA  polymerase II and several histone methylation marks, to obtain a more complete view of cocaine-induced changes in gene expression and associated adaptations in  numerous modes of chromatin regulation in the mouse nucleus accumbens, a key brain reward region. We demonstrate an unexpectedly large number of pre-mRNA splicing alterations in response to repeated cocaine treatment. In addition, we identify combinations of chromatin changes, or signatures, that correlate with cocaine-dependent regulation of gene expression, including those involving pre-mRNA alternative splicing. Through bioinformatic prediction and biological validation, we identify one particular splicing factor, A2BP1(Rbfox1/Fox-1), which is enriched at genes that display certain chromatin signatures and contributes to drug-induced behavioral abnormalities. Together, this delineation  of the cocaine-induced epigenome in the nucleus accumbens reveals several novel modes of regulation by which cocaine alters the brain. CONCLUSIONS: We establish combinatorial chromatin and transcriptional profiles in mouse nucleus accumbens after repeated cocaine treatment. These results serve as  an important resource for the field and provide a template for the analysis of other systems to reveal new transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of neuronal regulation.", "22649236": "The molecular mechanism underlying induction by cocaine of \u0394FosB, a transcription factor important for addiction, remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate a necessary role for two transcription factors, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)  and serum response factor (SRF), in mediating this induction within the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region. CREB and SRF are both activated in NAc by cocaine and bind to the fosB gene promoter. Using viral-mediated Cre recombinase expression in the NAc of single- or double-floxed  mice, we show that deletion of both transcription factors from this brain region  completely blocks cocaine induction of \u0394FosB in NAc, whereas deletion of either factor alone has no effect. Furthermore, deletion of both SRF and CREB from NAc renders animals less sensitive to the rewarding effects of moderate doses of cocaine when tested in the conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure and also  blocks locomotor sensitization to higher doses of cocaine. Deletion of CREB alone has the opposite effect and enhances both cocaine CPP and locomotor sensitization. In contrast to \u0394FosB induction by cocaine, \u0394FosB induction in NAc  by chronic social stress, which we have shown previously requires activation of SRF, is unaffected by the deletion of CREB alone. These surprising findings demonstrate the involvement of distinct transcriptional mechanisms in mediating \u0394FosB induction within this same brain region by cocaine versus stress. Our results also establish a complex mode of regulation of \u0394FosB induction in response to cocaine, which requires the concerted activities of both SRF and CREB.", "18635399": "Changes in gene expression in brain reward regions are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis and persistence of drug addiction. Recent studies have begun to  focus on the molecular mechanisms by which drugs of abuse and related environmental stimuli, such as drug-associated cues or stress, converge on the genome to alter specific gene programs. Increasing evidence suggests that these stable gene expression changes in neurons are mediated in part by epigenetic mechanisms that alter chromatin structure on specific gene promoters.

However, most of these approaches are still limited by the fact that organs and tissues are composed of  multiple cell types that are each unique in their patterns of gene expression. To identify the transcriptome from a single cell type in a complex tissue, investigators have relied upon physical methods to separate cell types or in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Here, we describe a strategy to rapidly and efficiently isolate ribosome-associated mRNA transcripts from any cell type in vivo. We have created a mouse line, called RiboTag, which carries an Rpl22 allele with a floxed wild-type C-terminal exon followed by an identical C-terminal exon that has three copies of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope inserted  before the stop codon. When the RiboTag mouse is crossed to a cell-type-specific  Cre recombinase-expressing mouse, Cre recombinase activates the expression of epitope-tagged ribosomal protein RPL22(HA), which is incorporated into actively translating polyribosomes. Immunoprecipitation of polysomes with a monoclonal antibody against HA yields ribosome-associated mRNA transcripts from specific cell types.

As a corollary, dysfunction in reward circuits might contribute to the recent rise of obesity and eating disorders. Here we assess brain mechanisms known to generate \"liking\" and \"wanting\" for foods and evaluate their interaction with regulatory mechanisms of  hunger and satiety, relevant to clinical issues. \"Liking\" mechanisms include hedonic circuits that connect together cubic-millimeter hotspots in forebrain limbic structures such as nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum (where opioid/endocannabinoid/orexin signals can amplify sensory pleasure). \"Wanting\" mechanisms include larger opioid networks in nucleus accumbens, striatum, and amygdala that extend beyond the hedonic hotspots, as well as mesolimbic dopamine  systems, and corticolimbic glutamate signals that interact with those systems.

Despite the known role of the nucleus accumbens in directing appetitive and consummatory behavior, there has been little examination of the influences that serotonin receptors may play in modulating feeding within nucleus accumbens circuitry. In these experiments, the  authors examined the effects of bilateral nucleus accumbens infusions of the 5-HT1/7 receptor agonist 5-CT (at 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, or 4.0 microg/0.5 microl/side),  the 5-HT receptor agonist EMD 386088 (at 0.0, 1.0, and 4.0 microg/0.5 microl/side), or the 5-HT2C preferential agonist RO 60-0175 (at 0.0, 2.0, or 5.0  microg/0.5 microl/side) on food intake and locomotor activity in the rat. Intra-accumbens infusions of 5-CT caused a dose-dependent reduction of food intake and rearing behavior, both in food-restricted animals given 2-hr free access to Purina Protab RMH 3000 Chow, as well as in nondeprived rats offered 2-hr access to a highly palatable fat/sucrose diet. In contrast, stimulation of 5-HT receptors with EMD 386088 caused a dose-dependent increase of intake under both feeding conditions, without affecting measures of locomotion. Infusions of the moderately selective 5-HT2C receptor agonist RO 60-0175 had no effects on feeding or locomotor measures in food-restricted animals, but did reduce intake of the fat/sucrose in nonrestricted animals at the 2.0 microg, but not the 5.0 microg dose. Intra-accumbens infusions of selective antagonists for the 5-HT (SB  269970), 5-HT (SB 252585), and 5-HT2C (RS 102221) receptors did not affect locomotion, and demonstrated no lasting changes in feeding for any of the groups  tested. These data are the first to suggest that the activation of different serotonin receptor subtypes within the feeding circuitry of the medial nucleus accumbens differentially influence consummatory behavior.", "17913892": "Anorexia nervosa is a growing concern in mental health, often inducing death. The potential neuronal deficits that may underlie abnormal inhibitions of food intake, however, remain largely unexplored. We hypothesized that anorexia may involve altered signaling events within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain structure involved in reward. We show here that direct stimulation of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) 4 receptors (5-HT(4)R) in the NAc reduces the physiological drive to eat and increases CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) mRNA levels in fed and food-deprived mice. It further shows that injecting 5-HT(4)R antagonist or siRNA-mediated 5-HT(4)R knockdown into the NAc induced hyperphagia only in fed mice. This hyperphagia was not associated with changes in CART mRNA expression in the NAc in fed and food-deprived mice. Results include that 5-HT(4)R control CART mRNA expression into the NAc via a cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Considering that CART may interfere with food- and drug-related rewards, we tested whether the appetite suppressant properties of 3,4-N-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) involve the 5-HT(4)R. Using 5-HT(4)R knockout mice, we demonstrate that 5-HT(4)R are required for the anorectic effect of MDMA as well as for the MDMA-induced enhancement of CART mRNA expression in the NAc. Directly injecting CART peptide or CART siRNA into the NAc reduces or increases food consumption, respectively. Finally, stimulating 5-HT(4)R- and MDMA-induced anorexia were both reduced by injecting CART siRNA into the NAc. Collectively, these results demonstrate that 5-HT(4)R-mediated up-regulation of CART in the NAc triggers the appetite-suppressant effects of ecstasy.", "15301600": "These experiments tested whether nucleus accumbens muscarinic or nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation is required for rats to learn to lever press for sucrose. Muscarinic blockade with scopolamine (1.0 microg/side or 10.0 microg/side), but not nicotinic antagonism with mecamylamine (10.0 microg/side),  inhibited learning and performance when applied to the core or shell. Further experiments showed that acute accumbens scopolamine treatment increased locomotor activity and reduced sucrose consumption. However, microanalyses of behavioral events in the instrumental chamber revealed that reductions of lever press performance during muscarinic blockade were not due to gross motor dysfunction. Accumbens core scopolamine was subsequently shown to reduce the amount of work rats would expend under a progressive ratio paradigm.

To help characterize the contribution of the LH to the expression of AcbSh-mediated feeding, we used the immunohistochemical detection of the nuclear protein Fos to determine whether inhibition of AcbSh cells results in an activation of LH neurons. Injections of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol into the AcbSh greatly increased the number of cells exhibiting Fos-like immunoreactivity in the LH, as well as in the lateral septum, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars compacta, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Blocking activation of LH neurons with the selective NMDA receptor blocker D(-)-AP-5 is known to suppress deprivation-induced feeding. We found that injections of D(-)-AP5 into the LH also dose-dependently suppressed AcbSh-mediated feeding. It is likely that inhibition of GABAergic neurons in the AcbSh is responsible for eliciting this feeding. If a behaviorally relevant GABAergic projection terminates in the LH, we should be able to mimic the effects seen after inhibition of the projection neurons by applying a GABA receptor blocker to the area. However, injections of the GABA(A) receptor blocker bicuculline or the GABA(B) receptor blocker saclofen did not significantly affect food intake. Thus, it appears that the expression of the feeding response depends on an NMDA-preferring receptor-mediated activation of LH neurons and is not the result of disinhibiting LH cells by disrupting transmission at GABA synapses.", "24441680": "Although the prefrontal cortex influences motivated behavior, its role in food intake remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate a role for D1-type dopamine receptor-expressing neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the regulation of feeding. Food intake increases activity in D1 neurons of the mPFC in mice, and optogenetic photostimulation of D1 neurons increases feeding. Conversely, inhibition of D1 neurons decreases intake. Stimulation-based mapping  of prefrontal D1 neuron projections implicates the medial basolateral amygdala (mBLA) as a downstream target of these afferents. mBLA neurons activated by prefrontal D1 stimulation are CaMKII positive and closely juxtaposed to prefrontal D1 axon terminals. Finally, photostimulating these axons in the mBLA is sufficient to increase feeding, recapitulating the effects of mPFC D1 stimulation. These data describe a new circuit for top-down control of food intake.", "22445344": "Salient but aversive stimuli inhibit the majority of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and cause conditioned place aversion (CPA).

We also observe that GABA neurons increase their firing in response to a footshock and provide evidence that driving GABA neurons with optogenetic effectors is sufficient to affect behavior. Taken together, our data demonstrate that synaptic inhibition of DA neurons drives place aversion.", "14634645": "Conditional mutant techniques that allow spatial and temporal control over gene expression can be used to create mice with restricted genetic modifications. These mice serve as powerful disease models in which gene function in adult tissues can be specifically dissected. Current strategies for conditional genetic manipulation are inefficient, however, and often lack sufficient spatial control. Here we use viral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) to generate a specific knockdown of Th, the gene encoding the dopamine synthesis enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, within midbrain neurons of adult mice. This localized gene knockdown resulted in behavioral changes, including a motor performance deficit and reduced response to a psychostimulant. These results underscore the potential of using viral-mediated RNAi for the rapid production and testing of new genetic disease models.

We especially focus on the transitions in striatal control over drug seeking behaviour that underlie these transitions since functional heterogeneity of the striatum was a key area of Ann Kelley's research interests and one in which she made enormous contributions. We also discuss the hypothesis in light of recent data that the emergence of a compulsive drug seeking habit both reflects a shift to dorsal striatal control over behaviour and impaired prefontal cortical inhibitory control mechanisms. We further discuss aspects of the vulnerability to compulsive drug use and in particular the impact of impulsivity.

Importantly, these distinct features of DA function are due in large part to separate neural circuits involving connections arising from different DA-releasing nuclei and projections to separate afferent targets. Emerging data has suggested that this same principle of separate neural circuits may be applicable within structural subregions, such as the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Further, DA may act selectively on smaller ensembles of cells (or, microcircuits) via differential DA receptor density and distinct inputs and outputs of the microcircuits, thus enabling new learning about Pavlovian cues, instrumental responses, subjective reward processing and decision-making. In this review, by taking advantage of studies using subsecond voltammetric techniques in behaving animals to study how rapid changes in DA levels affect behavior, we examine the spatial and temporal features of DA release and how it relates to both normal learning and similarities to pathological learning in the form of addiction.", "19364532": "Numerous biochemical as well as electrophysiological techniques require tissue that must be retrieved very quickly following death in order to preserve the physiological integrity of the neuronal environment. Therefore, the ability to accurately predict the precise locations of brain regions of interest (ROI) and to retrieve those areas as quickly as possible following the brain harvest is critical for subsequent analyses. One way to achieve this objective is the utilization of high-resolution MRI to guide the subsequent dissections. In the present study, individual MRI images of the brains of rhesus and cynomolgus macaques that had chronically self-administered ethanol were employed in order to determine which blocks of dissected tissue contained specific ROIs. MRI-guided brain dissection of discrete brain regions was completely accurate in 100% of the cases. In comparison, approximately 60-70% accuracy was achieved in dissections that relied on external landmarks alone without the aid of MRI.

While ethanol (EtOH) is a drug of abuse which has been widely studied, the properties of ethanol which contribute to its abuse potential are not known. We have developed a brain slice preparation of the VTA in order to study the action  of EtOH on putative dopamine neurons. Concentrations of EtOH from 20 to 320 mM produce a dose-dependent excitation of the dopamine-type neurons of the VTA. About 89% of neurons which have electrophysiological characteristics established  for presumed dopamine-containing neurons were excited by ethanol in the pharmacologically relevant concentration range. This excitation persists in low-calcium, high-magnesium medium, which suggests a direct excitatory action of  EtOH on dopamine-type cells in the VTA slice.", "28123032": "We recently developed a rat model of incubation of methamphetamine craving after  choice-based voluntary abstinence. Here, we studied the role of dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and dorsomedial striatum (DMS) in this incubation. We trained rats to self-administer palatable food pellets (6 d, 6 h/d) and methamphetamine (12 d, 6 h/d). We then assessed relapse to methamphetamine seeking under extinction conditions after 1 and 21 abstinence days. Between tests, the rats underwent voluntary abstinence (using a discrete choice procedure between methamphetamine and food; 20 trials/d) for 19 d. We used in situ hybridization to measure the colabeling of the activity marker Fos with Drd1 and Drd2 in DMS and DLS after the tests. Based on the in situ hybridization colabeling results, we tested the causal role of DMS D1 and D2 family receptors, and DMS neuronal ensembles in \"incubated\" methamphetamine seeking, using selective dopamine receptor antagonists (SCH39166 or raclopride) and the Daun02 chemogenetic inactivation procedure, respectively. Methamphetamine seeking was higher after 21 d of voluntary abstinence than after 1 d (incubation of methamphetamine craving). The  incubated response was associated with increased Fos expression in DMS but not in DLS; Fos was colabeled with both Drd1 and Drd2 DMS injections of SCH39166 or raclopride selectively decreased methamphetamine seeking after 21 abstinence days. In Fos-lacZ transgenic rats, selective inactivation of relapse test-activated Fos neurons in DMS on abstinence day 18 decreased incubated methamphetamine seeking on day 21. Results demonstrate a role of DMS dopamine D1  and D2 receptors in the incubation of methamphetamine craving after voluntary abstinence and that DMS neuronal ensembles mediate this incubation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In human addicts, abstinence is often self-imposed and relapse can be  triggered by exposure to drug-associated cues that induce drug craving. We recently developed a rat model of incubation of methamphetamine craving after choice-based voluntary abstinence.

We determined whether this incubation is associated with alterations in candidate genes in dorsal striatum (DS), a brain area implicated in cue- and context-induced drug relapse. We first measured mRNA expression of 24 candidate genes in whole DS extracts after short (2 d) or prolonged (1 month) withdrawal in rats following extended-access methamphetamine or saline (control condition) self-administration (9 h/d, 10 d). We found minimal changes. Next, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we compared gene expression in Fos-positive dorsal striatal neurons, which were activated during \"incubated\" cue-induced drug-seeking tests after prolonged withdrawal, with nonactivated Fos-negative neurons. We found significant increases in mRNA expression of immediate early genes (Arc, Egr1), Bdnf and its receptor (Trkb), glutamate receptor subunits (Gria1, Gria3, Grm1), and epigenetic enzymes (Hdac3, Hdac4, Hdac5, GLP, Dnmt3a, Kdm1a) in the Fos-positive neurons only. Using RNAscope to determine striatal subregion and cell-type specificity of the activated neurons,  we measured colabeling of Fos with Drd1 and Drd2 in three DS subregions. Fos expression was neither subregion nor cell-type specific (52.5 and 39.2% of Fos expression colabeled with Drd1 and Drd2, respectively). Finally, we found that DS injections of SCH23390 (C17H18ClNO), a D1-family receptor antagonist known to block cue-induced Fos induction, decreased incubated cue-induced methamphetamine  seeking after prolonged withdrawal. Results demonstrate a critical role of DS in  incubation of methamphetamine craving and that this incubation is associated with selective gene-expression alterations in cue-activated D1- and D2-expressing DS neurons.", "25855177": "Context-induced reinstatement of drug seeking is a well established animal model  for assessing the neural mechanisms underlying context-induced drug relapse, a major factor in human drug addiction. Neural activity in striatum has previously  been shown to contribute to context-induced reinstatement of heroin, cocaine, and alcohol seeking, but not yet for methamphetamine seeking. In this study, we found that context-induced reinstatement of methamphetamine seeking increased expression of the neural activity marker Fos in dorsal but not ventral striatum.  Reversible inactivation of neural activity in dorsolateral but not dorsomedial striatum using the GABA agonists muscimol and baclofen decreased context-induced  reinstatement. Based on our previous findings that Fos-expressing neurons play a  critical role in conditioned drug effects, we assessed whether context-induced reinstatement was associated with molecular alterations selectively induced within context-activated Fos-expressing neurons. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate reinstatement-activated Fos-positive neurons from Fos-negative neurons in dorsal striatum and used quantitative PCR to assess gene  expression within these two populations of neurons. Context-induced reinstatement was associated with increased expression of the immediate early genes Fos and FosB and the NMDA receptor subunit gene Grin2a in only Fos-positive neurons. RNAscope in situ hybridization confirmed that Grin2a, as well as Grin2b, expression were increased in only Fos-positive neurons from dorsolateral, but not dorsomedial, striatum. Our results demonstrate an important role of dorsolateral  striatum in context-induced reinstatement of methamphetamine seeking and that this reinstatement is associated with unique gene alterations in Fos-expressing neurons.", "22470541": "Methamphetamine (METH) addiction is associated with several neuropsychiatric symptoms. Little is known about the effects of METH on gene expression and epigenetic modifications in the rat nucleus accumbens (NAC). Our study investigated the effects of a non-toxic METH injection (20 mg/kg) on gene expression, histone acetylation, and the expression of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT), ATF2, and of the histone deacetylases (HDACs), HDAC1 and HDAC2, in that structure. Microarray analyses done at 1, 8, 16 and 24 hrs after the METH injection identified METH-induced changes in the expression of genes previously implicated in the acute and longterm effects of psychostimulants, including immediate early genes and corticotropin-releasing factor (Crf). In contrast, the METH injection caused time-dependent decreases in the expression of other genes including Npas4 and cholecystokinin (Cck). Pathway analyses showed that genes with altered expression participated in behavioral performance, cell-to-cell signaling, and regulation of gene expression. PCR analyses confirmed the changes in the expression of c-fos, fosB, Crf, Cck, and Npas4 transcripts. To determine if the METH injection caused post-translational changes in histone markers, we used western blot analyses and identified METH-mediated decreases in  histone H3 acetylated at lysine 9 (H3K9ac) and lysine 18 (H3K18ac) in nuclear sub-fractions. In contrast, the METH injection caused time-dependent increases in acetylated H4K5 and H4K8. The changes in histone acetylation were accompanied by  decreased expression of HDAC1 but increased expression of HDAC2 protein levels. The histone acetyltransferase, ATF2, showed significant METH-induced increased in protein expression. These results suggest that METH-induced alterations in global gene expression seen in rat NAC might be related, in part, to METH-induced changes in histone acetylation secondary to changes in HAT and HDAC expression. The causal role that HATs and HDACs might play in METH-induced gene expression needs to be investigated further.", "21697359": "Based on earlier gene expression and chromatin array data, we identified the protein, dishevelled (DVL)-2, as being regulated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc),  a key brain reward region, in the mouse social defeat model of depression. Here,  we validate these findings by showing that DVL2 mRNA and protein levels are downregulated in NAc of mice susceptible to social defeat stress, effects not seen in resilient mice. Other DVL isoforms, DVL1 and DVL3, show similar patterns  of regulation. Downregulation of DVL was also demonstrated in the NAc of depressed humans examined postmortem. Interestingly, several members of the WNT (Wingless)-DVL signaling cascade, including phospho-GSK3\u03b2 (glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2), also show significant downregulation in the NAc of susceptible, but not resilient, mice, demonstrating concerted regulation of this pathway in the NAc due to social defeat stress. By using viral-mediated gene transfer to overexpress a dominant-negative mutant of DVL in NAc, or by using a pharmacological inhibitor of DVL administered into this brain region, we show that blockade of DVL function renders mice more susceptible to social defeat stress and promotes depression-like behavior in other assays. Similar prodepression-like effects were induced upon overexpressing GSK3\u03b2 in the NAc, while overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of GSK3\u03b2 promoted resilience to social defeat stress. These findings are consistent with the knowledge that downregulation of DVL and phospho-GSK3\u03b2 reflects an increase in GSK3\u03b2 activity. These studies reveal a novel role for the DVL-GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathway, acting within the brain's reward circuitry, in regulating susceptibility to chronic stress.", "11931738": "Current treatments for depression are inadequate for many individuals, and progress in understanding the neurobiology of depression is slow. Several promising hypotheses of depression and antidepressant action have been formulated recently. These hypotheses are based largely on dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and hippocampus and implicate corticotropin-releasing factor, glucocorticoids, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and CREB. Recent work has looked beyond hippocampus to other brain areas  that are also likely involved. For example, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and certain hypothalamic nuclei are critical in regulating motivation, eating, sleeping, energy level, circadian rhythm, and responses to rewarding and aversive stimuli, which are all abnormal in depressed patients. A neurobiologic understanding of depression also requires identification of the genes that make individuals vulnerable or resistant to the syndrome. These advances will fundamentally improve the treatment and prevention of depression.", "11164755": "BACKGROUND: Studies in experimental animals have implicated the mesolimbic dopaminergic projections into the ventral striatum in the neural processes underlying behavioral reinforcement and motivated behavior; however, understanding the relationship between subjective emotional experience and ventral striatal dopamine (DA) release has awaited human studies. Using positron  emission tomography (PET), we correlated the change in endogenous dopamine concentrations following dextroamphetamine (AMPH) administration with the associated hedonic response in human subjects and compared the strength of this correlation across striatal subregions. METHODS: We obtained PET measures of [(11)C]raclopride specific binding to DA D2/D3 receptors before and after AMPH injection (0.3 mg/kg IV) in seven healthy subjects. The change in [(11)C]raclopride binding potential (DeltaBP) induced by  AMPH pretreatment and the correlation between DeltaBP and the euphoric response to AMPH were compared between the anteroventral striatum (AVS; comprised of accumbens area, ventromedial caudate, and anteroventral putamen) and the dorsal caudate (DCA) using an MRI-based region of interest analysis of the PET data. RESULTS: The mean DeltaBP was greater in the AVS than in the DCA (p <.05). The AMPH-induced changes in euphoria analog scale scores correlated inversely with DeltaBP in the AVS (r = -.95; p <.001), but not in the DCA (r =.30, ns). Post hoc assessments showed that changes in tension-anxiety ratings correlated positively  with DeltaBP in the AVS (r =.80; p [uncorrected] <.05) and that similar relationships may exist between DeltaBP and emotion ratings in the ventral putamen (as were found in the AVS). CONCLUSIONS: The preferential sensitivity of the ventral striatum to the DA releasing effects of AMPH previously demonstrated in experimental animals extends to humans. The magnitude of ventral striatal DA release correlates positively with the hedonic response to AMPH.", "25662840": "Small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (KCa2) channels control neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity, and have been implicated in substance abuse.

In the present study, an integrative functional genomics approach shows that genetic datasets for alcohol, nicotine, and illicit drugs contain the family of KCNN genes. Alcohol preference and dependence QTLs contain KCNN2 and KCNN3, and Kcnn3 transcript levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of genetically diverse BXD strains of mice predicted voluntary alcohol consumption. Transcript levels of Kcnn3 in the NAc negatively correlated with alcohol intake levels in BXD strains, and alcohol dependence enhanced the strength of this association. Microinjections of the KCa2 channel inhibitor apamin into the NAc increased alcohol intake in control C57BL/6J mice,  while spontaneous seizures developed in alcohol-dependent mice following apamin injection. Consistent with this finding, alcohol dependence enhanced the intrinsic excitability of medium spiny neurons in the NAc core and reduced the function and protein expression of KCa2 channels in the NAc. Altogether, these data implicate the family of KCNN genes in alcohol, nicotine, and drug addiction, and identify KCNN3 as a mediator of voluntary and excessive alcohol consumption.  KCa2.3 channels represent a promising novel target in the pharmacogenetic treatment of alcohol and drug addiction.", "24584329": "In a rat model of drug craving and relapse, cue-induced drug seeking progressively increases after withdrawal from methamphetamine and other drugs, a  phenomenon termed 'incubation of drug craving'. However, current experimental procedures used to study incubation of drug craving do not incorporate negative consequences of drug use, which is a common factor promoting abstinence in humans. Here, we studied whether incubation of methamphetamine craving is observed after suppression of drug seeking by adverse consequences (punishment).  We trained rats to self-administer methamphetamine or palatable food for 9 h per  day for 14 days; reward delivery was paired with a tone-light cue. Subsequently,  for one group within each reward type, 50% of the lever-presses were punished by  mild footshock for 9-10 days, whereas for the other group lever-presses were not  punished. Shock intensity was gradually increased over time. Next, we assessed cue-induced reward seeking in 1-h extinction sessions on withdrawal days 2 and 21. Response-contingent punishment suppressed extended-access methamphetamine or  food self-administration; surprisingly, food-trained rats showed greater resistance to punishment than methamphetamine-trained rats. During the relapse tests, both punished and unpunished methamphetamine- and food-trained rats showed significantly higher cue-induced reward seeking on withdrawal day 21 than on day  2. These results demonstrate that incubation of both methamphetamine and food craving occur after punishment-induced suppression of methamphetamine or palatable food self-administration. Our procedure can be used to investigate mechanisms of relapse to drug and palatable food seeking under conditions that more closely approximate the human condition.", "24475032": "Methamphetamine (METH) is a widely abused amphetamine analog. Few studies have investigated the molecular effects of METH exposure in adult animals. Herein, we  determined the consequences of an injection of METH (10 mg/kg) on transcriptional effects of a second METH (2.5 mg/kg) injection given one month later. We thus measured gene expression by microarray analyses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of 4 groups of rats euthanized 2 hours after the second injection: saline-pretreated followed by saline-challenged (SS) or METH-challenged (SM); and METH-pretreated followed by saline-challenged (MS) or METH-challenged (MM). Microarray analyses revealed that METH (2.5 mg/kg) produced acute changes (1.8-fold; P<0.01) in the expression of 412 (352 upregulated, 60 down-regulated) transcripts including cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript, corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh), oxytocin (Oxt), and vasopressin (Avp) that were upregulated. Injection of  METH (10 mg/kg) altered the expression of 503 (338 upregulated, 165 down-regulated) transcripts measured one month later (MS group). These genes also included Cart and Crh. The MM group showed altered expression of 766 (565 upregulated, 201 down-regulated) transcripts including Avp, Cart, and Crh. The METH-induced increased Crh expression was enhanced in the MM group in comparison  to SM and MS groups. Quantitative PCR confirmed the METH-induced changes in mRNA  levels. Therefore, a single injection of METH produced long-lasting changes in gene expression in the rodent NAc. The long-term increases in Crh, Cart, and Avp  mRNA expression suggest that METH exposure produced prolonged activation of the endogenous stress system. The METH-induced changes in oxytocin expression also suggest the possibility that this neuropeptide might play a significant role in the neuroplastic and affiliative effects of this drug.", "21056409": "BACKGROUND: Small conductance calcium-activated potassium type 2 channels (SK2) control excitability and contribute to plasticity by reducing excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Recent evidence suggests that SK2 channels form a calcium-dependent negative-feedback loop with synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Addiction to alcohol and other drugs of abuse induces plastic changes in glutamatergic synapses that include the targeting of NMDA receptors to synaptic sites; however, the role of SK2 channels in alcohol-associated homeostatic plasticity is unknown. METHODS: Electrophysiology, Western blot, and behavioral analyses were used to quantify changes in hippocampal small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channel function and expression using well-characterized in vitro and in vivo models of chronic alcohol exposure. RESULTS: Chronic ethanol reduced apamin-sensitive SK currents in cornu ammonis 1  pyramidal neurons that were associated with a downregulation of surface SK2 channels. Blocking SK channels with apamin potentiated excitatory postsynaptic potentials in control but not ethanol-treated cornu ammonis 1 pyramidal neurons,  suggesting that chronic ethanol disrupts the SK channel-NMDA receptor feedback loop. Alcohol reduced expression of SK2 channels and increased expression of NMDA receptors at synaptic sites in a mouse model. Positive modulation of SK function  by 1-EBIO decreased alcohol withdrawal hyperexcitability and attenuated ethanol withdrawal neurotoxicity in hippocampus. The 1-EBIO also reduced seizure activity in mice undergoing withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence that SK2 channels contribute to alcohol-associated adaptive plasticity of glutamatergic synapses and that positive modulation of SK channels reduces the severity of withdrawal-related hyperexcitability. Therefore, SK2 channels appear to be critical regulators of alcohol-associated plasticity and may be novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of addiction.", "23583616": "Mesolimbic dopamine (DA) is a critical component of the brain circuitry regulating behavioral activation and effort-related processes. Although nucleus accumbens (NAc) DA depletions or antagonism leave aspects of appetite and primary food motivation intact, rats with impaired DA transmission reallocate their instrumental behavior away from food-reinforced tasks with high response requirements, and instead select less effortful food-seeking behaviors. Previous  work showed that adenosine A2A antagonists can reverse the effects of DA D2 antagonists on effort-related choice, and that stimulation of adenosine A2A receptors produces behavioral effects that are similar to those induced by DA antagonism. The present review summarizes the literature on the role of NAc DA and adenosine in effort-related processes, and also presents original data on the effects of local stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in NAc core. Local injections of the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine directly into NAc core produces shifts in effort-related choice behavior similar to those induced by DA  antagonism or A2A receptor stimulation, decreasing lever pressing but increasing  chow intake in rats responding on a concurrent fixed ratio/chow feeding choice task. In contrast, injections into a neostriatal control site dorsal to the NAc were ineffective. The actions of pilocarpine on this task were attenuated by co-administration of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine. Thus, drugs that act  on DA, adenosine A2A, and muscarinic receptors regulate effort-related choice behavior, which may have implications for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms such as psychomotor slowing, fatigue or anergia that can be observed in depression and other disorders.", "24269937": "Neuromedin U (NMU) is a highly conserved neuropeptide which regulates food intake and body weight. Transgenic mice lacking NMU are hyperphagic and obese, making NMU a novel target for understanding and treating obesity. Neuromedin U receptor  2 (NMUR2) is a high-affinity receptor for NMU found in discrete regions of the central nervous system, in particular the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), where it may be responsible for mediating the anorectic effects of NMU. We hypothesized that selective knock down of NMUR2 in the PVN of  rats would increase their sensitivity to the reinforcing properties of food resulting in increased intake and preference for high-fat obesogenic food. To this end, we used viral-mediated RNAi to selectively knock down NMUR2 gene expression in the PVN. In rats fed a standard chow, NMUR2 knockdown produced no significant effect on food intake or body weight. However, when the same rats were fed a high-fat diet (45% fat), they consumed significantly more food, gained more body weight, and had increased feed efficiency relative to controls. Furthermore, NMUR2 knockdown rats demonstrated significantly greater binge-type food consumption of the high-fat diet and showed a greater preference for higher-fat food. These results demonstrate that NMUR2 signaling in the PVN regulates consumption and preference for high-fat foods without disrupting feeding behavior associated with non-obesogenic standard chow.", "23374642": "Our brains are hardwired to respond and seek immediate rewards. Thus, it is not surprising that many people overeat, which in some can result in obesity, whereas others take drugs, which in some can result in addiction. Though food intake and  body weight are under homeostatic regulation, when highly palatable food is available, the ability to resist the urge to eat hinges on self-control. There is no homeostatic regulator to check the intake of drugs (including alcohol); thus,  regulation of drug consumption is mostly driven by self-control or unwanted effects (i.e., sedation for alcohol). Disruption in both the neurobiological processes that underlie sensitivity to reward and those that underlie inhibitory  control can lead to compulsive food intake in some individuals and compulsive drug intake in others. There is increasing evidence that disruption of energy homeostasis can affect the reward circuitry and that overconsumption of rewarding food can lead to changes in the reward circuitry that result in compulsive food intake akin to the phenotype seen with addiction. Addiction research has produced new evidence that hints at significant commonalities between the neural substrates underlying the disease of addiction and at least some forms of obesity. This recognition has spurred a healthy debate to try and ascertain the extent to which these complex and dimensional disorders overlap and whether or not a deeper understanding of the crosstalk between the homeostatic and reward systems will usher in unique opportunities for prevention and treatment of both obesity and drug addiction.", "19336238": "What brain reward systems mediate motivational 'wanting' and hedonic 'liking' for food rewards? And what roles do those systems play in eating disorders?

It also considers brain 'wanting' or incentive salience systems important to appetite, such as mesolimbic dopamine systems and opioid motivation circuits that extend beyond the hedonic hotspots. Finally, it considers some potential ways in which 'wanting' and 'liking' might relate to eating disorders.", "21182572": "The present study used conventional and quantitative microdialysis to assess glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in the hippocampal CA3 area of the  rat following a moderate-dose ethanol treatment regimen. Male Wistar rats received 3.4 g/kg of ethanol or water for 6 days via gastric gavage. Microdialysis experiments commenced 2 days later. Basal and depolarization-induced glutamate overflow were significantly elevated in ethanol-treated animals. Basal and depolarization-induced gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) overflow were unaltered. Quantitative no-net-flux microdialysis was used to determine if changes in dialysate glutamate levels following ethanol administration are due to an increase in release or a decrease in uptake. To confirm the validity of this method for quantifying basal glutamate dynamics, extracellular concentrations of glutamate and the extraction fraction, which reflects changes in analyte clearance, were quantified in response to retro-dialysis of the glutamate uptake blocker trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (tPDC). tPDC significantly decreased the extraction fraction for glutamate,  resulting in augmented extracellular glutamate concentrations. Repeated ethanol administration did not alter the glutamate extraction fraction. However, extracellular glutamate concentrations were significantly elevated, indicating that glutamate release is increased as a consequence of repeated ethanol administration. These data demonstrate that repeated bouts of moderate ethanol consumption alter basal glutamate dynamics in the CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus. Basal glutamate release is augmented, whereas glutamate uptake is unchanged. Furthermore, they suggest that dysregulation of glutamate transmission in this region may contribute to the previously documented deficits in cognitive  function associated with moderate dose ethanol use.", "18671810": "BACKGROUND: There has been some difficulty getting standard laboratory rats to voluntarily consume large amounts of ethanol without the use of initiation procedures. It has previously been shown that standard laboratory rats will voluntarily consume high levels of ethanol if given intermittent-access to 20% ethanol in a 2-bottle-choice setting [Wise, Psychopharmacologia 29 (1973), 203].  In this study, we have further characterized this drinking model. METHODS: Ethanol-na\u00efve Long-Evans rats were given intermittent-access to 20% ethanol (three 24-hour sessions per week). No sucrose fading was needed and water was always available ad libitum. Ethanol consumption, preference, and long-term drinking behaviors were investigated. Furthermore, to pharmacologically validate  the intermittent-access 20% ethanol drinking paradigm, the efficacy of acamprosate and naltrexone in decreasing ethanol consumption were compared with those of groups given continuous-access to 10 or 20% ethanol, respectively. Additionally, ethanol consumption was investigated in Wistar and out-bred alcohol preferring (P) rats following intermittent-access to 20% ethanol. RESULTS: The intermittent-access 20% ethanol 2-bottle-choice drinking paradigm led standard laboratory rats to escalate their ethanol intake over the first 5 to 6 drinking sessions, reaching stable baseline consumption of high amounts of ethanol (Long-Evans: 5.1 +/- 0.6; Wistar: 5.8 +/- 0.8 g/kg/24 h, respectively). Furthermore, the cycles of excessive drinking and abstinence led to an increase in ethanol preference and increased efficacy of both acamprosate and naltrexone in Long-Evans rats. P-rats initiate drinking at a higher level than both Long-Evans and Wistar rats using the intermittent-access 20% ethanol paradigm and showed a trend toward a further escalation in ethanol intake over time (mean ethanol intake: 6.3 +/- 0.8 g/kg/24 h). CONCLUSION: Standard laboratory rats will voluntarily consume ethanol using the intermittent-access 20% ethanol drinking paradigm without the use of any initiation procedures. This model promises to be a valuable tool in the alcohol research field.", "11826141": "Cocaine addiction is a chronically relapsing brain disease, but its neural basis  is not yet well understood. Clinical reports underscore the possible importance of associative processes for regulating at least some aspects of cocaine addiction. The present study reports the effects of reversible lidocaine-induced  inactivation of rostral basolateral amygdala (rBLA) and caudal basolateral amygdala (cBLA) regions on the maintenance and reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior in rats trained to self-administer 1 mg/kg cocaine under a second order  schedule of drug delivery. Both regions of the basolateral amygdala were investigated because they have dissociable effects on cognitive task performance. Results demonstrated that after self-administration training and a period of extinction and abstinence, lidocaine inactivation of the rBLA and cBLA attenuated the reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior induced by cocaine-associated cues examined in conjunction with a single priming injection of cocaine. In contrast,  lidocaine inactivation of only the rBLA blocked reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior induced by cocaine-associated cues examined alone. Additional differences were shown during cocaine maintenance testing where inactivation of only the cBLA attenuated drug-seeking behavior. Drug intake was not altered. Thus, the rBLA and cBLA appear to selectively and dissociably regulate drug-seeking behavior under conditions of cocaine abstinence (cue-induced reinstatement) and repeated cocaine use (maintenance), respectively. These findings suggest that the basolateral amygdala may be more functionally heterogeneous than commonly thought for regulating drug-seeking behavior. The basis for this dissociation might be related to neuroanatomical connections of the rBLA and cBLA with segregated, but parallel, corticostriatalpallidothalamic circuits.", "10875899": "Comparative studies have implicated striatal and mesial forebrain circuitry in the generation of autonomic, endocrine, and behavioral responses for incentives.  Using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging, we sought to visualize functional activation of these regions in 12 normal volunteers as they anticipated and responded for monetary incentives. Both individual and group analyses of time-series data revealed significant activation of striatal and mesial forebrain structures (including insula, caudate, putamen,  and mesial prefrontal cortex) during trials involving both monetary rewards and punishments. In addition to these areas, during trials involving punishment, group analysis revealed activation foci in the anterior cingulate and thalamus. These results corroborate comparative studies which implicate striatal and mesial forebrain circuitry in the elaboration of incentive-driven behavior. This report  also introduces a new paradigm for probing the functional integrity of this circuitry in humans.", "23248274": "The basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry plays a central role in selecting actions that achieve reward-seeking outcomes and avoid aversive ones. Inputs of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in this circuitry are transmitted through two parallel pathways: the striatonigral direct pathway and the striatopallidal indirect pathway. In the NAc, dopaminergic (DA) modulation of the direct and the  indirect pathways is critical in reward-based and aversive learning and cocaine addiction. To explore how DA modulation regulates the associative learning behavior, we developed an asymmetric reversible neurotransmission-blocking technique in which transmission of each pathway was unilaterally blocked by transmission-blocking tetanus toxin and the transmission on the intact side was pharmacologically manipulated by local infusion of a receptor-specific agonist or antagonist. This approach revealed that the activation of D1 receptors and the inactivation of D2 receptors postsynaptically control reward learning/cocaine addiction and aversive learning in a direct pathway-specific and indirect pathway-specific manner, respectively. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that  aversive learning is elicited by elaborate actions of NMDA receptors, adenosine A2a receptors, and endocannabinoid CB1 receptors, which serve as key neurotransmitter receptors in inducing long-term potentiation in the indirect pathway. Thus, reward and aversive learning is regulated by pathway-specific neural plasticity via selective transmitter receptors in the NAc circuit.", "23403696": "The upregulation of glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmission is thought to be partly responsible for the acute withdrawal symptoms and craving experienced by alcohol-dependent patients. Most physiological evidence supporting this hypothesis is based on data from animal studies. In addition, clinical data show  that GABAergic and anti-glutamatergic drugs ameliorate withdrawal symptoms, offering indirect evidence indicative of glutamatergic hyperexcitability in alcohol-dependent subjects. We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify the glutamate (Glu) levels in healthy control subjects and in alcohol-dependent patients immediately after detoxification. The volumes of interest were located in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the anterior cingulate  cortex (ACC), which are two brain areas that have important functions in reward circuitry. In addition to Glu, we quantified the levels of combined Glu and glutamine (Gln), N-acetylaspartate, choline-containing compounds, and creatine. The Glu levels in the NAcc were significantly higher in patients than in controls. Craving, which was measured using the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale, correlated positively with levels of combined Glu and Gln in the NAcc and  in the ACC. The levels of all other metabolites were not significantly different  between patients and controls. The increased Glu levels in the NAcc in alcohol-dependent patients shortly after detoxification confirm the animal data and suggest that striatal glutamatergic dysfunction is related to ethanol withdrawal. The positive correlation between craving and glutamatergic metabolism in both key reward circuitry areas support the hypothesis that the glutamatergic  system has an important role in the later course of alcohol dependence with respect to abstinence and relapse.", "7946359": "Following chronic cocaine treatment, we have found a long-lasting increase in AP-1 binding in the rat nucleus accumbens and striatum, two important targets of  the behavioral effects of cocaine. This increase develops gradually over several  days and remains at 50% of maximal levels 7 days after the last cocaine exposure. Supershift experiments, along with one- and two-dimensional Western blots, indicate that this chronic AP-1 complex contains at least four Fos-related antigens (FRAs), some of which display delta FosB-like immunoreactivity, that are induced selectively by chronic, but not acute, cocaine treatment. The same chronic FRAs were also induced by several different types of chronic treatments in a region-specific manner in the brain. Thus, the chronic FRAs and associated chronic AP-1 complex could mediate some of the long-term changes in gene expression unique to the chronic-treated state as opposed to the acute-treated and normal states.", "26865020": "Environmental stimuli and objects, including rewards, are often processed sequentially in the brain. Recent work suggests that the phasic dopamine reward prediction-error response follows a similar sequential pattern. An initial brief, unselective and highly sensitive increase in activity unspecifically detects a wide range of environmental stimuli, then quickly evolves into the main response  component, which reflects subjective reward value and utility. This temporal evolution allows the dopamine reward prediction-error signal to optimally combine speed and accuracy.", "22676718": "In this review we propose that there are sex differences in how men and women enter onto the path that can lead to addiction. Males are more likely than females to engage in risky behaviors that include experimenting with drugs of abuse, and in susceptible individuals, they are drawn into the spiral that can eventually lead to addiction. Women and girls are more likely to begin taking drugs as self-medication to reduce stress or alleviate depression. For this reason women enter into the downward spiral further along the path to addiction,  and so transition to addiction more rapidly. We propose that this sex difference  is due, at least in part, to sex differences in the organization of the neural systems responsible for motivation and addiction. Additionally, we suggest that sex differences in these systems and their functioning are accentuated with addiction. In the current review we discuss historical, cultural, social and biological bases for sex differences in addiction with an emphasis on sex differences in the neurotransmitter systems that are implicated.", "26822352": "High rates of relapse to drug use during abstinence is a defining feature of drug addiction. In abstinent drug users, drug relapse is often precipitated by acute exposure to the self-administered drug, drug-associated cues, stress, as well as  by short-term and protracted withdrawal symptoms. In this review, we discuss different animal models that have been used to study behavioral and neuropharmacological mechanisms of these relapse-related phenomena. In the first  part, we discuss relapse models in which abstinence is achieved through extinction training, including the established reinstatement model, as well as the reacquisition and resurgence models. In the second part, we discuss recent animal models in which drug relapse is assessed after either forced abstinence (e.g., the incubation of drug craving model) or voluntary (self-imposed) abstinence achieved either by introducing adverse consequences to ongoing drug self-administration (e.g., punishment) or by an alternative nondrug reward using  a discrete choice (drug vs. palatable food) procedure. We conclude by briefly discussing the potential implications of the recent developments of animal models of drug relapse after voluntary abstinence to the development of medications for  relapse prevention.", "15856078": "Cocaine addiction in humans is characterized by cycles of abstinence from drug-taking and relapse. Here, electrophysiological recording procedures were used to determine whether nucleus accumbens (Acb) neuronal firing properties are  altered following interruption and resumption of cocaine self-administration. Rats (n = 12) were trained to self-administer cocaine (2 h daily sessions) then divided into two groups. Acb activity was recorded for Group 1 (controls) during  two additional self-administration sessions completed over the next 2 days (test  sessions 1 and 2). Acb activity was recorded for Group 2 (1-month) during one self-administration session completed the next day (test 1), and during a second  self-administration session 1 month later (test 2). As in prior reports, a subset of Acb neurons exhibited patterned discharges (short duration and/or long-term cyclic alterations, termed 'phasically active') relative to cocaine-reinforced responding during test session 1. Remarkably, the percentage of phasically active cells dramatically increased (nearly two-fold) following 1-month abstinence, in the core but not the shell of the Acb. Likewise, the strength of the neural correlates (determined via signal-to-baseline ratios) also increased as a function of abstinence. Extinction experiments in another set of rats (n = 12) revealed an increased motivational state for the drug following abstinence. The results show that abstinence from cocaine self-administration causes a dramatic increase in the number and strength of Acb neurons that encode cocaine-related information, thus representing the first neurophysiological correlate of heightened activation of the 'brain reward system' following abstinence and resumption (relapse) of cocaine consumption.", "22915104": "In humans, exposure to cues previously associated with heroin use often provokes  relapse after prolonged withdrawal periods. In rats, cue-induced heroin seeking progressively increases after withdrawal (incubation of heroin craving). Here, we examined the role of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) neuronal ensembles in the enhanced response to heroin cues after prolonged withdrawal or the expression of  incubation of heroin craving. We trained rats to self-administer heroin (6 h/d for 10 d) and assessed cue-induced heroin seeking in extinction tests after 1 or  14 withdrawal days. Cue-induced heroin seeking increased from 1 to 14 d and was accompanied by increased Fos expression in \u223c12% of OFC neurons. Nonselective inactivation of OFC neurons with the GABA agonists baclofen + muscimol decreased  cue-induced heroin seeking on withdrawal day 14 but not day 1. We then used the Daun02 inactivation procedure to assess a causal role of the minority of selectively activated Fos-expressing OFC neurons (that presumably form cue-encoding neuronal ensembles) in cue-induced heroin seeking after 14 withdrawal days. We trained c-fos-lacZ transgenic rats to self-administer heroin  and 11 d later reexposed them to heroin-associated cues or novel cues for 15 min  (induction day), followed by OFC Daun02 or vehicle injections 90 min later; we then tested the rats in extinction tests 3 d later. Daun02 selectively decreased  cue-induced heroin seeking in rats previously reexposed to the heroin-associated  cues on induction day but not in rats exposed previously to novel cues. Results suggest that heroin-cue-activated OFC neuronal ensembles contribute to the expression of incubation of heroin craving.", "19420249": "Stable brain function relies on homeostatic maintenance of the functional output  of individual neurons. In general, neurons function by converting synaptic input  to output as action potential firing. To determine homeostatic mechanisms that balance this input-output/synapse-membrane interaction, we focused on nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons and demonstrated a novel form of synapse-to-membrane homeostatic regulation, homeostatic synapse-driven membrane plasticity (hSMP). Through hSMP, NAc neurons adjusted their membrane excitability to functionally compensate for basal shifts in excitatory synaptic input. Furthermore, hSMP was triggered by synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and expressed by the modification of SK-type Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels. Moreover, hSMP in NAc neurons was abolished in rats during a short- (2 d) or long- (21 d) term withdrawal from repeated intraperitoneal injections of cocaine (15 mg/kg/d, 5 d). These results suggest that hSMP is a novel form of synapse-to-membrane homeostatic plasticity and dysregulation of hSMP may contribute to cocaine-induced cellular alterations  in the NAc.", "12511956": "Cocaine addiction is thought to involve persistent neurobiological changes that facilitate relapse to drug use despite efforts to abstain. But the propensity for relapse may be reduced by extinction training--a form of inhibitory learning that progressively reduces cocaine-seeking behaviour in the absence of cocaine reward. Here we show that extinction training during withdrawal from chronic cocaine self-administration induces experience-dependent increases in the GluR1 and GluR2/3 subunits of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate)  glutamate receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell, a brain region that is critically involved in cocaine reward. Increases in the GluR1 subunit are positively associated with the level of extinction achieved during training, suggesting that GluR1 may promote extinction of cocaine seeking. Indeed, viral-mediated overexpression of both GluR1 and GluR2 in nucleus accumbens shell  neurons facilitates extinction of cocaine- but not sucrose-seeking responses. A single extinction training session, when conducted during GluR subunit overexpression, attenuates stress-induced relapse to cocaine seeking even after GluR overexpression declines. Our findings indicate that extinction-induced plasticity in AMPA receptors may facilitate control over cocaine seeking by restoring glutamatergic tone in the nucleus accumbens, and may reduce the propensity for relapse under stressful situations in prolonged abstinence.", "11177523": "The question of addiction concerns the process by which drug-taking behavior, in  certain individuals, evolves into compulsive patterns of drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior that take place at the expense of most other activities, and the inability to cease drug-taking, that is, the problem of relapse. In this paper we summarize one view of this process, the \"incentive-sensitization\" view,  which we first proposed in 1993. Four major tenets of the incentive-sensitization view are discussed. These are: (1) potentially addictive drugs share the ability  to alter brain organization; (2) the brain systems that are altered include those normally involved in the process of incentive motivation and reward; (3) the critical neuroadaptations for addiction render these brain reward systems hypersensitive (\"sensitized\") to drugs and drug-associated stimuli; and (4) the brain systems that are sensitized do not mediate the pleasurable or euphoric effects of drugs (drug \"liking\"), but instead they mediate a subcomponent of reward we have termed incentive salience (drug \"wanting\").", "15688093": "Forebrain serotonergic lesions attenuate the ability of d-amphetamine to decrease impulsivity in a delay-discounting paradigm, potentially through interactions between the serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) systems. Nucleus accumbens (NAC) lesions increase impulsivity, but the extent to which accumbal DA is involved in  regulating impulsive choice is unknown. In the current study, the effects of intra-accumbal infusions of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) on impulsive choice were evaluated, in combination with d-amphetamine and serotonergic drugs, in order to  investigate the importance of 5-HT : DA interactions in the control of impulsive  behavior. Following training on a delay-discounting task, animals received intra-NAC 6-OHDA or sham surgery. Postoperatively, subjects received systemic injections of d-amphetamine (0, 0.3, 1.0, 1.5 mg/kg) and the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 mg/kg). Intra-NAC 6-OHDA, which reduced local DA and NA levels by 70-75%, had no effect on delay-discounting, but transiently potentiated the d-amphetamine-induced decrease in impulsive choice. 8-OH-DPAT (1.0 mg/kg) increased impulsivity in sham-operated controls, an effect which was  blocked by the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY 100635. However, 8-OH-DPAT had no effect on impulsivity in 6-OHDA NAC lesioned rats. 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg), which did not itself alter task performance, blocked the effect of d-amphetamine in sham-operated controls, while WAY 100635 augmented the effect of amphetamine in all subjects. In an additional experiment, intracerebroventricular administration of the selective serotonergic toxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, which decreased forebrain 5-HT levels by 85-90%, did not block 8-OH-DPAT's ability to increase impulsive choice. These data suggest a significant role for 5-HT : DA interactions within the NAC in the control of impulsivity, and in the mechanism by which amphetamine decreases impulsive choice.", "8956377": "Impulsive behaviour is an important component of many psychiatric syndromes. It is often expressed as aggressive or violent behaviour, but may also be non-violent. One important factor which might lead to aggression or violence is an inability to tolerate a delay of gratification, leading to frustration and aggressive outbursts. In animals and in man, tolerance to delay of gratification  can be studied using delay of reinforcement (also known as self-control) procedures. Experiments with delay of reinforcement in rats show that serotonergic mechanisms may be involved in this form of impulsive behaviour, which seems to support clinical findings in this area. The present experiment examined the effects of a series of psychoactive drugs on delays of reinforcement using a steady state operant procedure involving lever-pressing by rats. Rats were trained to choose between one food pellet delivered immediately and three or five pellets delivered after varying delays which increased during the course of  the session. Using this procedure the rats remained sensitive to within-and between-session variations in delay of reinforcement even after long periods of testing. It was used to demonstrate an increase in impulsivity (after d-amphetamine) and a reduction in impulsivity (after diazepam and metergoline), indicated by shifts in the choice/delay function. The other drugs tested, imipramine, citalopram, haloperidol and carbamazepine, had no consistent effects  although tested at doses which are active in other procedures. This method has proved to be a useful way of examining the effects of drugs on choice of delay of reinforcement in the rat. Although the behavioural basis of tolerance to delay of reinforcement (self-control) has received considerable attention, little is yet known about the biological basis. The present data indicate that the procedure described here can be used to elucidate the pharmacological basis of this aspect  of impulsive behaviour.", "26063926": "Epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone modifications, regulate responsiveness to  drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, but relatively little is known about the regulation of addictive-like behaviors by DNA methylation. To investigate the influence of DNA methylation on the locomotor-activating effects of cocaine and on drug-seeking behavior, rats receiving methyl supplementation via chronic l-methionine (MET) underwent either a sensitization regimen of intermittent cocaine injections or intravenous self-administration of cocaine, followed by cue-induced and drug-primed reinstatement. MET blocked sensitization to the locomotor-activating effects of cocaine and attenuated drug-primed reinstatement, with no effect on cue-induced reinstatement or sucrose self-administration and reinstatement. Furthermore, upregulation of DNA methyltransferase 3a and 3b and global DNA hypomethylation were observed in the nucleus accumbens core (NAc), but not in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), of cocaine-pretreated rats. Glutamatergic projections from the mPFC to the NAc are critically involved in the regulation of cocaine-primed reinstatement, and activation of both brain regions  is seen in human addicts when reexposed to the drug. When compared with vehicle-pretreated rats, the immediate early gene c-Fos (a marker of neuronal activation) was upregulated in the NAc and mPFC of cocaine-pretreated rats after  cocaine-primed reinstatement, and chronic MET treatment blocked its induction in  both regions. Cocaine-induced c-Fos expression in the NAc was associated with reduced methylation at CpG dinucleotides in the c-Fos gene promoter, effects reversed by MET treatment. Overall, these data suggest that drug-seeking behaviors are, in part, attributable to a DNA methylation-dependent process, likely occurring at specific gene loci (e.g., c-Fos) in the reward pathway.", "24721195": "One of the major challenges in preclinical studies of alcohol abuse and dependence remains the development of paradigms that will elicit high ethanol intake and mimic the progressive transition from low or moderate social drinking  to excessive alcohol consumption. Exposure of outbred rats to repeated cycles of  free-choice ethanol intake and withdrawal with the use of intermittent access to  20% ethanol in a 2-bottle choice procedure (IA2BC) has been shown to induce a gradual escalation of voluntary ethanol intake and preference, eventually reaching ethanol consumption levels of 5-6\u00a0g/kg/24\u00a0h, and inducing pharmacologically relevant blood ethanol concentrations (BECs). This procedure has recently been gaining popularity due to its simplicity, high validity, and reliable outcomes. Here we review experimental and methodological data related to IA2BC, and discuss the usefulness and advantages of this procedure as a valuable  pre-training method for initiating operant ethanol self-administration of high ethanol intake, as well as conditioned place preference (CPP). Despite some limitations, we provide evidence that IA2BC and related operant procedures provide the possibility to operationalize multiple aspects of alcohol abuse and addiction in a rat model, including transition from social-like drinking to excessive alcohol consumption, binge drinking, alcohol seeking, relapse, and neuroadaptations related to excessive alcohol intake. Hence, IA2BC appears to be  a useful and relevant procedure for preclinical evaluation of potential therapeutic approaches against alcohol abuse disorders.", "25449839": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been found to play roles in many types of plasticity including drug addiction. Here, we focus on rodent studies over the past two decades that have demonstrated diverse roles of BDNF in models  of cocaine addiction. First, we will provide an overview of studies showing that  cocaine exposure alters (and generally increases) BDNF levels in reward-related regions including the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. Then we will review evidence that BDNF contributes to behavioral changes in animal models of cocaine addiction, focusing on conditioned place preference, behavioral sensitization, maintenance and reinstatement of self-administration, and incubation of cocaine craving. Last, we will review the  role of BDNF in synaptic plasticity, particularly as it relates to plasticity of  AMPA receptor transmission after cocaine exposure. We conclude that BDNF regulates cocaine-induced behaviors in a highly complex manner that varies depending on the brain region (and even among different cell types within the same brain region), the nature of cocaine exposure, and the \"addiction phase\" examined (e.g., acquisition vs maintenance; early vs late withdrawal). These complexities make BDNF a daunting therapeutic target for treating cocaine addiction. However, recent clinical evidence suggests that the serum BDNF level may serve as a biomarker in cocaine addicts to predict future relapse, providing  an alternative direction for exploring BDNF's potential relevance to treating cocaine addiction.", "2572241": "The hippocampal input to the nucleus accumbens was interrupted by an electrolytic lesion of the fimbria-fornix. Boutons degenerating as a result of this lesion were found in asymmetric synaptic contact with dendritic spines and shafts in the medial part of the nucleus accumbens. Dopaminergic fibres and terminals in this area, identified using an antibody to tyrosine hydroxylase, established symmetrical synaptic contacts with dendritic shafts, spines and somata. In material where neurons in the nucleus accumbens had been Golgi-impregnated, it was found that the hippocampal and dopaminergic inputs converge onto the same neurons, and that the post-synaptic targets could be either spiny or aspiny neurons. It has been suggested that hippocampal dysfunction is involved in schizophrenia and this convergence of input from the hippocampus onto the same neurons that are post-synaptic to the dopaminergic input, which presumably originates from neurons in the ventral tegmental area, may provide an anatomical  basis for the therapeutic effects of neuroleptic drugs which are dopamine antagonists.", "23423476": "The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a critical brain region involved in many reward-related behaviors. The NAc comprises major compartments the core and the shell, which encompass several subterritories. GABAergic medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) constitute the output neurons of the NAc core and shell. While the functional organization of the NAc core outputs resembles the one described for the dorsal striatum, a simple classification of the NAc shell neurons has been difficult to define due to the complexity of the compartmental segregation of cells. We used a variety of BAC transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescence (EGFP) or the Cre-recombinase (Cre) under the control of the promoter of dopamine D1, D2, and D3 receptors and of adenosine A2a receptor to dissect the microanatomy of the NAc. Moreover, using various immunological markers we characterized in detail the distribution of MSNs in the mouse NAc. In  addition, cell-type specific extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in the NAc subterritories was analyzed following acute administration of SKF81297 (a D1R-like agonist), quinpirole (a D2 receptors (D2R)-like agonist), apomorphine (a non-selective DA receptor agonist), raclopride (a D2R-like antagonist), and psychostimulant drugs, including cocaine  and d-amphetamine. Each drug generated a unique topography and cell-type specific activation of ERK in the NAc. Our results show the existence of marked differences in the receptor expression pattern and functional activation of MSNs  within the shell subterritories. This study emphasizes the anatomical and functional heterogeneity of the NAc, which will have to be considered in its further study.", "18248891": "Disturbances of the orbitofrontal-striatal pathways in humans have been associated with several psychopathologies including obsessive-compulsive disorder and drug addiction. In nonhuman primates, different subareas of the orbitofrontal cortex project topographically to central and ventromedial parts of the striatum. Relatively little is known about the anatomical organization of the rat orbital cortex while there is a growing interest in this cortical area from a functional  and behavioral point of view. The aim of the present neuroanatomical tracing study was to determine in rats the striatal target area of the projections of the orbital cortex as well as the topographical organization within these projections. To this end, anterograde tracers were injected in the different cytoarchitectonically distinct subareas of the orbital cortex. The results show that the individual orbital areas, i.e. medial orbital area, ventral orbital area, ventrolateral orbital area and lateral orbital area, project to central parts of the caudate-putamen, exhibiting a mediolateral and, to a lesser degree,  rostrocaudal topographical arrangement. Orbital projections avoid the most dorsal, as well as rostral and caudal parts of the caudate-putamen. Terminal fields from cytoarchitectonically different areas show a considerable overlap. Superficial cortical layers project preferentially to the striatal matrix, deep layers to the patch compartment. The projections from the ventrolateral orbital area are strongest and occupy the most extensive striatal area. In addition to projections to the caudate-putamen, the ventrolateral, lateral and dorsolateral orbital areas have a scarce projection to the most lateral part of the nucleus accumbens shell in the ventral striatum. In contrast to nonhuman primates, the remainder of the rat nucleus accumbens is virtually free of orbital projections.", "16420431": "Although increases in dopamine transmission in the brain are clearly involved in  the reinstatement of cocaine seeking, the role of nucleus accumbens dopamine in cocaine priming-induced reinstatement remains controversial. The goal of these experiments was to evaluate the relative contributions of D1-like and D2-like dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens core and shell in the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviour. Initially, rats were trained to press a lever for cocaine (0.25 mg, i.v.) using a fixed-ratio 5 (FR5) schedule of reinforcement. Responding was then extinguished by substituting saline for cocaine. During the reinstatement phase, subtype-specific dopamine receptor agonists were microinjected into the nucleus accumbens core or medial shell in order to assess  their ability to induce cocaine seeking. Administration of the D1/D5 dopamine receptor agonist SKF-81297 (1.0 microg) into the nucleus accumbens shell, but not core, reinstated drug-seeking behaviour. Similarly, microinjection of quinpirole  (3.0 microg), a D2/D3 dopamine receptor agonist, into the nucleus accumbens shell and not core reinstated drug-seeking behaviour. In contrast, administration of the D3- or D4-preferring dopamine receptor agonists PD 128,907 (1.5 and 3.0 microg) and PD 168,077 (0.3 and 3.0 microg), respectively, did not promote reinstatement when administered into either the core or the shell. Taken together, these results indicate that activation of D1/D5 or D2 dopamine receptors, in the limbic shell subregion of the nucleus accumbens but not the basal ganglia-orientated accumbens core, promotes the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviour.", "11458536": "When ovariectomized female rats receive estrogen, the response to the psychomotor stimulants amphetamine or cocaine is enhanced. Estrous cycle-dependent differences in amphetamine-stimulated behaviors and striatal dopamine release are also noted. Intact female rats exhibit a greater behavioral response to amphetamine on estrus than they do on other days of the cycle. Ovariectomy results in attenuation of amphetamine-induced behavior and the striatal dopamine  response to amphetamine. Physiological doses of estrogen given to ovariectomized  rats reinstate both of these responses to a level comparable to that in estrous females. Furthermore, a sex difference is noted, in that females tend to exhibit  a greater behavioral response to the psychomotor stimulants, and estrogen enhances this sex difference. Repeated treatment with amphetamine or cocaine produces a progressive increase in behavioral responsiveness with subsequent drug administration, a process known as sensitization. In rodents, behavioral sensitization results in increases in both frequency and duration of psychomotor  behaviors such as rotational behavior, stereotyped grooming, headbobs, and forelimb movements. Interestingly, females display greater sensitization of behaviors in response to psychomotor stimulants than do males. Previous research  results are summarized, and new results are presented, demonstrating that estrogen selectively enhances components of behavior that exhibit sensitization in female rats. Results also indicate gender differences in sensitization independent of gonadal hormones, suggesting that the neural systems that undergo  sensitization are sexually dimorphic.", "15555492": "Both clinical and rodent studies show sexually dimorphic patterns in the behavioral response to cocaine in all phases of the addiction process (induction, maintenance, and relapse). Clinical and rodent studies also indicate that hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual/estrous cycle modulate cocaine-induced subjective effects in women and locomotor activity in female rats. Evidence suggests that gonadal hormones underlie these observed differences and could be the biological basis of sex-specific differences in cocaine addiction. To study the effects of gonadal hormones on cocaine-induced activity, two approaches have  been used. First, studies have examined the role of endogenous hormones through gonadectomy (GDX) and side-by-side comparisons with intact rats. Second, the individual contributions of testosterone, progesterone, and estrogen have been determined by hormone replacement in GDX rats. In this review, we discuss gonadal hormones as the biological basis for the behavioral responses to cocaine, and the clinical implications of these findings.", "24559678": "Midbrain dopamine neurons fire in bursts conveying salient information. Bursts are associated with pauses in tonic firing of striatal cholinergic interneurons.  Although the reciprocal balance of dopamine and acetylcholine in the striatum is  well known, how dopamine neurons control cholinergic neurons has not been elucidated. Here, we show that dopamine neurons make direct fast dopaminergic and glutamatergic connections with cholinergic interneurons, with regional heterogeneity. Dopamine neurons drive a burst-pause firing sequence in cholinergic interneurons in the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens, mixed actions in the accumbens core, and a pause in the dorsal striatum. This heterogeneity is due mainly to regional variation in dopamine-neuron glutamate cotransmission. A single dose of amphetamine attenuates dopamine neuron connections to cholinergic interneurons with dose-dependent regional specificity. Overall, the present data indicate that dopamine neurons control striatal circuit function via discrete, plastic connections with cholinergic interneurons.", "20484653": "Recent evidence suggests the intriguing possibility that midbrain dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons may use fast glutamatergic transmission to communicate with their postsynaptic targets. Because of technical limitations, direct demonstration of the existence of this signaling mechanism has been limited to experiments using cell culture preparations that often alter neuronal function including neurotransmitter phenotype. Consequently, it remains uncertain whether  glutamatergic signaling between DAergic neurons and their postsynaptic targets exists under physiological conditions. Here, using an optogenetic approach, we provide the first conclusive demonstration that mesolimbic DAergic neurons in mice release glutamate and elicit excitatory postsynaptic responses in projection neurons of the nucleus accumbens. In addition, we describe the properties of the  postsynaptic glutamatergic responses of these neurons during experimentally evoked burst firing of DAergic axons that reproduce the reward-related phasic population activity of the mesolimbic projection. These observations indicate that, in addition to DAergic mechanisms, mesolimbic reward signaling may involve  glutamatergic transmission.", "17600522": "Many lesion studies report an amazing variety of deficits in behavioral functions that cannot possibly be encoded in great detail by the relatively small number of midbrain dopamine neurons. Although hoping to unravel a single dopamine function  underlying these phenomena, electrophysiological and neurochemical studies still  give a confusing, mutually exclusive, and partly contradictory account of dopamine's role in behavior. However, the speed of observed phasic dopamine changes varies several thousand fold, which offers a means to differentiate the behavioral relationships according to their time courses. Thus dopamine is involved in mediating the reactivity of the organism to the environment at different time scales, from fast impulse responses related to reward via slower changes with uncertainty, punishment, and possibly movement to the tonic enabling of postsynaptic motor, cognitive, and motivational systems deficient in Parkinson's disease.", "16917821": "Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1, -2, and -3) mediate the accumulation of transmitter glutamate into synaptic vesicles in glutamatergic neurons. VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are more reliable glutamatergic neuron markers, since VGLUT3 also exists in other neuron types. To study whether the dopaminergic neuron uses glutamate as a cotransmitter, we analyzed VGLUTs expression in dopamine neurons of adult male  rats by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In the ventral midbrain,  in situ hybridization analysis revealed no VGLUT1 mRNA expression, a widespread but discrete pattern of VGLUT2 mRNA expression, and a highly limited expression of VGLUT3 mRNA. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis detected full-length VGLUT2 gene transcripts in the ventral midbrain. Using in situ hybridization combined with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunostaining, only VGLUT2 signals were detectable in some TH-labeled neurons of A10 dopamine neuron groups, with the highest incidence (20%) in the rostral linear nucleus of the ventral tegmental area. In the forebrain, VGLUT2 signals were demonstrated in half of the A11 TH-labeled neurons in the hypothalamus. Double-label immunostaining for VGLUT2 and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 or TH showed that double-labeled varicosities are rarely observed in any target regions examined of A10 and A11 dopamine neuron groups. These results indicate that VGLUT2 is expressed in subsets of A10 and A11 dopamine neurons, which might release dopamine and glutamate separately from different varicosities in the majority of their single  axons.", "15970218": "Latent inhibition (LI) is the proactive interference of repeated nonreinforced preexposure to a stimulus with subsequent performance on a learning task involving that stimulus. The present experiments investigated the role of the nucleus accumbens (NAC) in LI. LI was measured in a thirst motivated conditioned  emotional response procedure with low or high number of conditioning trials, and  in two-way active avoidance procedure with the stages of preexposure and conditioning taking place in the same or different contexts. Sham-lesioned rats showed LI with low but not high number of conditioning trials and if preexposure  and conditioning took place in the same context but not if the context was changed between the stages. Lesion to the shell subregion of the NAC disrupted LI but LI was preserved in rats with a combined lesion to the NAC shell and core subregions. Moreover, rats with a combined shell-core lesion persisted in showing LI in spite of high number of conditioning trials and in spite of context change. These results show that the NAC is not essential for the acquisition of LI but rather plays a key role in regulating the expression of LI. Moreover, they suggest that the two subregions of the NAC contribute competitively and cooperatively to this process, selecting the response appropriate to the stimulus-no event or the stimulus-reinforcement association in conditioning.", "12445722": "Two anatomically and neurochemically distinguishable regions of the nucleus accumbens (Acb), the core and the shell, have been shown to differentially regulate feeding behavior. Nevertheless, despite the well-known role of Acb dopamine in the modulation of motivated behaviors, there have been no studies directly comparing the effects of acute dopamine receptor blockade in the Acb core versus the Acb shell on feeding. In this study, D1- or D2-selective dopamine receptor antagonists were infused bilaterally into the Acb core or shell of hungry rats, whereupon feeding, drinking, and spontaneous motor activity were monitored. Both the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 (0, 1, and 2 microg/0.5 microl) and the D2 antagonist raclopride (0, 1, and 2 microg/0.5 microl) markedly suppressed  ambulation and rearing when infused into either the Acb core or shell. Total food intake and latency to begin feeding were unaffected by either drug in either site. SCH 23390 in the Acb shell, and raclopride in the Acb core or shell, significantly decreased the total number of feeding bouts. In the Acb core, raclopride produced a small but statistically significant increase in overall feeding duration. Dopamine receptor blockade in either site tended to increase mean feeding bout duration. Measures of drinking behavior were generally unaffected. Hence, dopamine receptor blockade in either the Acb core or shell of  hungry rats suppressed spontaneous motor activity and shifted the structure of feeding towards longer bout durations, but did not alter the total amount of food consumed. In the Acb shell, the effects of D1 receptor blockade tended to be of greater magnitude than the effects of D2 receptor blockade, although major differences between core and shell effects were not observed. These results are discussed with regard to current theories of dopaminergic control of feeding behavior, and with reference to the functional heterogeneity of Acb subregions.", "10594666": "We have previously shown in non-deprived rats that feeding of an unfamiliar palatable food (Fonzies(R)) phasically stimulates in vivo dopamine (DA) transmission in the medial nucleus accumbens (NAc) and this effect undergoes habituation after a previous (24 h) Fonzies meal (Bassareo & Di Chiara 1997, J. Neurosci., 17, 851-861). The present study shows that an unfamiliar food (Kinder(R)) with a taste and composition (milk chocolate) different from that of  Fonzies, also induces a release of DA in the NAc subjected to one-trial habituation. Habituation was taste specific as no cross-habituation was observed  between Fonzies and Kinder. In undeprived rats, a 40-min exposure to an intrinsic appetitive stimulus (food smell arising from a Fonzies-filled plastic box) also prevented the increase in dialysate DA associated with Fonzies feeding, and this  effect was partially reversed by food deprivation. Food deprivation also prevented habituation of Fonzies-induced increase of dialysate DA in the NAc. Predictive association of an empty plastic box to Fonzies feeding resulted in the acquisition of appetitive properties by the box and in facilitation (rather than  inhibition) of the phasic responsiveness of DA transmission to Fonzies feeding. A 10-min pre-exposure to appetitive olfactory stimuli intrinsic to Fonzies still prevented, like a 40-min pre-exposure, the NAc DA response to Fonzies feeding; however, a 5-min pre-exposure to these appetitive stimuli did not prevent the DA  response in the NAc. These results show that the phasic responsiveness of NAc DA  transmission to an unfamiliar palatable food is under strong modulatory control by primary (consummatory) and secondary (appetitive) stimuli, and that the sign and extent of this control depends on the nature of the appetitive stimulus, delay of reward and motivational state (deprivation).", "1577988": "The anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin was used to examine the topographical organization of the projections to the striatum arising from the various cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex in the rat. The relationship of the prefrontal cortical fibres with the compartmental organization of the ventral striatum was assessed by combining PHA-L tracing and  enkephalin-immunohistochemistry. The prefrontal cortex projects bilaterally with  an ipsilateral predominance to the striatum, sparing only the lateral part of the caudate-putamen complex. Each of the cytoarchitectonic subfields of the prefrontal cortex has a longitudinally oriented striatal terminal field that overlaps slightly with those of adjacent prefrontal areas. The projections of the medial subdivision of the prefrontal cortex distribute to rostral and medial parts of the striatum, whereas the lateral prefrontal subdivision projects to more caudal and lateral striatal areas. The terminal fields of the orbital prefrontal areas involve midventral and ventromedial parts of the caudate-putamen complex. The projection of the ventral orbital area overlaps with that of the prelimbic area in the ventromedial part of the caudate-putamen. In the \"shell\" region of the nucleus accumbens, fibres arising from the prelimbic area concentrate in areas of high cell density that are weakly enkephalin-immunoreactive, whereas fibres from the infralimbic area avoid such areas. Rostrolaterally in the \"core\" region of the nucleus accumbens, fibres from deep layer V and layer VI of the dorsal part of the prelimbic area avoid the enkephalin-positive areas surrounding the anterior commissure and distribute in an inhomogeneous way over the intervening moderately enkephalin-immunoreactive compartment. The other prefrontal afferents show only a preference for, but are not restricted to, the latter compartment. In the border region between the nucleus accumbens and the ventromedial part of the caudate-putamen complex, patches of strong enkephalin immunoreactivity receive prefrontal cortical input from deep layer V and layer VI, whereas fibres from more superficial cortical layers project to the surrounding matrix. Individual cytoarchitectonic subfields  of the prefrontal cortex thus have circumscribed terminal domains in the striatum. In combination with data on the organization of the midline and intralaminar thalamostriatal and thalamoprefrontal projections, the present results establish that the projections of the prefrontal cortical subfields converge in the striatum with those of their midline and intralaminar afferent nuclei. The present findings further demonstrate that the relationship of the prefrontal corticostriatal fibres with the neurochemical compartments of the ventral striatum can be influenced by both the areal and the laminar origin of the cortical afferents, depending on the particular ventral striatal region under consideration.", "19560604": "Alcohol consumption has been identified as an important risk factor for chronic disease and injury. In the first paper in this Series, we quantify the burden of  mortality and disease attributable to alcohol, both globally and for ten large countries. We assess alcohol exposure and prevalence of alcohol-use disorders on  the basis of reviews of published work. After identification of other major disease categories causally linked to alcohol, we estimate attributable fractions by sex, age, and WHO region. Additionally, we compare social costs of alcohol in  selected countries. The net effect of alcohol consumption on health is detrimental, with an estimated 3.8% of all global deaths and 4.6% of global disability-adjusted life-years attributable to alcohol. Disease burden is closely related to average volume of alcohol consumption, and, for every unit of exposure, is strongest in poor people and in those who are marginalised from society. The costs associated with alcohol amount to more than 1% of the gross national product in high-income and middle-income countries, with the costs of social harm constituting a major proportion in addition to health costs. Overall, we conclude that alcohol consumption is one of the major avoidable risk factors,  and actions to reduce burden and costs associated with alcohol should be urgently increased.", "19782055": "Stress is most often associated with aversive states. It rapidly induces the release of hormones and neuropeptides including dynorphin, which activates kappa  opioid receptors (KORs) in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In animal  models, many aversive effects of stress are mimicked or exacerbated by stimulation of KORs in limbic brain regions. Although KOR signaling during acute  stress may increase physical ability (by producing analgesia) and motivation to escape a threat (by producing aversion), prolonged KOR signaling in response to chronic or uncontrollable stress can lead to persistent expression of behavioral  signs that are characteristic of human depressive disorders (i.e., \"prodepressive-like\" signs). Accumulating evidence suggests that KORs contribute  to the progressive amplification (sensitization) of stress-induced behaviors that occurs with repeated exposure to stress. Many of the aversive effects of stress are blocked by KOR antagonists, suggesting that these agents may have potential as therapeutics for stress-related conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. This review summarizes current data on how KOR systems contribute to the acute (rapid), delayed, and cumulative molecular and behavioral effects of stress. We focus on behavioral paradigms that provide insight on interactions between stress and KOR function within each of these temporal categories. Using a simplified model, we consider the time course and mechanism of KOR-mediated effects in stress and suggest future directions that may be useful in determining whether KOR antagonists exert their therapeutic effects by preventing the development of stress-induced behaviors, the expression of stress-induced behaviors, or both.", "24904339": "The mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) systems play a key role in the physiology of reward seeking, motivation and motor control. Importantly, they are also involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, schizophrenia and addiction. Control of DA release in the striatum is tightly linked to firing of DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra (SN). However, local influences in the striatum affect release by exerting their action directly on axon terminals. For example, endogenous glutamatergic and cholinergic activity is sufficient to trigger striatal DA release independently of cell body firing. Recent developments involving genetic  manipulation, pharmacological selectivity or selective stimulation have allowed for better characterization of these phenomena. Such termino-terminal forms of control of DA release transform considerably our understanding of the mesolimbic  and nigrostriatal systems, and have strong implications as potential mechanisms to modify impaired control of DA release in the diseased brain. Here, we review these and related mechanisms and their implications in the physiology of ascending DA systems.", "21544206": "The neurotransmitter glutamate is released by excitatory projection neurons throughout the brain. However, non-glutamatergic cells, including cholinergic and monoaminergic neurons, express markers that suggest that they are also capable of vesicular glutamate release. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) express the Type-3 vesicular glutamate transporter (VGluT3), although whether they form functional glutamatergic synapses is unclear. To examine this possibility, we utilized mice expressing Cre-recombinase under control of the endogenous choline  acetyltransferase locus and conditionally expressed light-activated Channelrhodopsin2 in CINs. Optical stimulation evoked action potentials in CINs and produced postsynaptic responses in medium spiny neurons that were blocked by  glutamate receptor antagonists. CIN-mediated glutamatergic responses exhibited a  large contribution of NMDA-type glutamate receptors, distinguishing them from corticostriatal inputs. CIN-mediated glutamatergic responses were insensitive to  antagonists of acetylcholine receptors and were not seen in mice lacking VGluT3.  Our results indicate that CINs are capable of mediating fast glutamatergic transmission, suggesting a new role for these cells in regulating striatal activity.", "18987203": "Midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DANs) typically increase their discharge rate in response to appetitive predictive cues and outcomes, whereas striatal cholinergic tonically active interneurons (TANs) decrease their rate. This may indicate that  the activity of TANs and DANs is negatively correlated and that TANs can broaden  the basal ganglia reinforcement teaching signal, for instance by encoding worse than predicted events. We studied the activity of 106 DANs and 180 TANs of two monkeys recorded during the performance of a classical conditioning task with cues predicting the probability of food, neutral, and air puff outcomes. DANs responded to all cues with elevations of discharge rate, whereas TANs depressed their discharge rate. Nevertheless, although dopaminergic responses to appetitive cues were larger than their responses to neutral or aversive cues, the TAN responses were more similar. Both TANs and DANs responded faster to an air puff than to a food outcome; however, DANs responded with a discharge elevation, whereas the TAN responses included major negative and positive deflections. Finally, food versus air puff omission was better encoded by TANs. In terms of the activity of single neurons with distinct responses to the different behavioral events, both DANs and TANs were more strongly modulated by reward than by aversive related events and better reflected the probability of reward than aversive outcome. Thus, TANs and DANs encode the task episodes differentially. The DANs encode mainly the cue and outcome delivery, whereas the TANs mainly encode outcome delivery and omission at termination of the behavioral trial episode.", "17442245": "Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) activates the neural pathways that mediate reward, including dopaminergic terminal areas such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, a direct role of dopamine in ICSS-mediated reward has been questioned. Here, simultaneous voltammetric and electrophysiological recordings from the same electrode reveal that, at certain sites, the onset of anticipatory  dopamine surges and changes in neuronal firing patterns during ICSS are coincident, whereas sites lacking dopamine changes also lack patterned firing. Intrashell microinfusion of a D1, but not a D2 receptor antagonist, blocks ICSS.  An iontophoresis approach was implemented to explore the effect of dopamine antagonists on firing patterns without altering behavior. Similar to the microinfusion experiments, ICSS-related firing is selectively attenuated following D1 receptor blockade. This work establishes a temporal link between anticipatory rises of dopamine and firing patterns in the NAc shell during ICSS and suggests that they may play a similar role with natural rewards and during drug self-administration.", "11596051": "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) are widely distributed in the central nervous system, where they exert a modulatory influence on synaptic transmission. For the striatum, pharmacological evidence supports the presence of presynaptic alpha3beta2* and alpha4beta2* nAChR that modulate dopamine release from nigrostriatal terminals. The objective of this study was to examine the precise subcellular distribution of the nAChR beta2 subunit in these neurones and its localisation at presynaptic sites. Double immunolabelling with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) at the confocal level revealed that the cell bodies and axon terminals (synaptosomes) of nigrostriatal neurones were also immunoreactive for the nAChR beta2 subunit. Double-preembedding electron microscopy confirmed that beta2-immunogold labelling was enriched in TH-positive terminals in the dorsal striatum. Quantitative analysis of doubly immunogold-labelled sections in postembedding electron microscopy showed that 86% of TH-positive axonal boutons are also labelled for the nAChR beta2 subunit, whereas 45% of beta2 subunit-immunolabeled boutons do not contain TH. Thus the beta2 subunit is localised within at least two populations of axon terminals in the dorsal striatum. In these structures, 15% of beta2 subunit immunoreactivity was at the plasma membrane but was rarely associated with synapses. These findings are compatible with functional presynaptic beta2-containing nAChR that may be stimulated physiologically by acetylcholine that diffuses from synaptic or nonsynaptic sites of acetylcholine release. These results demonstrate the presynaptic localisation of an nAChR subunit in nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones, providing morphological evidence for the presynaptic nicotinic modulation of dopamine release.", "10714382": "The hedonic impact of taste is reflected in affective facial reactions made by human infants, other primates, and even rats. Originally studied in human infants, affective reactions to taste have also been used by affective neuroscience to identify hedonic brain systems in studies of animals (via application of neural stimulation, pharmacological activation, and neural lesion  manipulations). The chief limitation of measuring affective reactions is that it  is difficult for experimenters to know how to interpret them, and therefore how to interpret changes produced by brain manipulations. This paper notes guidelines to interpretation. It examines the phylogenetic continuity between humans, other  primates, and rats in terms of the microstructure of taste-elicited affective reactions. It reviews evidence that affective taste reactivity patterns truly reflect a 'core hedonic process' of palatability or affect, rather than being an  ingestion measure, consummatory behavior measure, or a sensory reflex measure. It reviews affective neuroscience studies of taste reactivity that have identified true hedonic brain substrates, and discriminated them from false hedonic brain substrates. It considers the neural bases of incentive 'wanting' versus 'liking'. Finally, it notes the difference between human subjective affective ratings of pleasure and 'core hedonic processes' reflected by behavioral affective reactions.", "22738383": "Convergent data from rodents and human studies have led to the development of models describing the neural mechanisms of fear extinction. Key components of the now well-characterized fear extinction network include the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortical regions. These models are fueling novel hypotheses that are currently being tested with much refined experimental tools to examine the interactions within this network. Lagging far behind, however, is the examination of sex differences in this network and how sex hormones influence the functional activity and reactivity of these brain regions in the context of fear  inhibition. Indeed, there is a large body of literature suggesting that sex hormones, such as estrogen, do modulate neural plasticity within the fear extinction network, especially in the hippocampus.After a brief overview of the fear extinction network, we summarize what is currently known about sex differences in fear extinction and the influence of gonadal hormones on the fear  extinction network. We then go on to propose possible mechanisms by which sex hormones, such as estrogen, may influence neural plasticity within the fear extinction network. We end with a discussion of how knowledge to be gained from developing this line of research may have significant ramifications towards the etiology, epidemiology and treatment of anxiety disorders.", "18441260": "During preclinical investigations into the safety of drugs and chemicals, many are found to interfere with reproductive function in the female rat. This interference is commonly expressed as a change in normal morphology of the reproductive tract or a disturbance in the duration of particular phases of the estrous cycle. Such alterations can be recognized only if the pathologist has knowledge of the continuously changing histological appearance of the various components of the reproductive tract during the cycle and can accurately and consistently ascribe an individual tract to a particular phase of the cycle. Unfortunately, although comprehensive reports illustrating the normal appearance  of the tract during the rat estrous cycle have been available over many years, they are generally somewhat ambiguous about distinct criteria for defining the end of one stage and the beginning of another. This detail is absolutely essential to achieve a consistent approach to staging the cycle. For the toxicologic pathologist, this report illustrates a pragmatic and practical approach to staging the estrous cycle in the rat based on personal experience and a review of the literature from the last century.", "8245220": "We have previously shown that the density of dendritic spines on hippocampal CA1  pyramidal cells is dependent on circulating estradiol and progesterone and fluctuates naturally during the 5 day estrous cycle in the adult rat. To date, however, no detailed characterization of the roles that these hormones play in regulation of spine density has been made. In order to determine the time courses and extent of the effects of estradiol and progesterone on dendritic spine density, we have analyzed the density of dendritic spines on the lateral branches of the apical dendritic tree of Golgi-impregnated CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells in several experiments. In summary, our findings included the following: (1) Following ovariectomy, circulating estradiol is undetectable within 24 hours; however, spine density decreases gradually over a 6 day period. (2) Spine density does not decrease any further up to 40 days following ovariectomy. (3) Treatment  with estradiol alone can reverse the ovariectomy-induced decrease in spine density. (4) Spine density begins to increase within 24 hours following estradiol benzoate injection in an ovariectomized animal, peaks at 2 and 3 days, then gradually decreases over the next 7 day period. (5) Although free estradiol is metabolized more rapidly than estradiol benzoate, there is no difference in the rate of decrease in spine density following injection of either form. (6) Progesterone has a biphasic effect on spine density in that progesterone treatment following estradiol initially increases spine density for a period of 2 to 6 hours but then results in a much sharper decrease than is observed following estradiol alone. By 18 hours following progesterone treatment, spine density is decreased nearly to 6 day ovariectomy values. (7) Treatment of intact rats with the progesterone receptor antagonist, RU 486, during the proestrus phase of the estrous cycle inhibits the proestrus to estrus drop in spine density. These findings account for both the gradual increase and rapid decrease in spine density which we have previously observed during the estrous cycle and indicate that progesterone in particular may be an important factor in the regulation of rapid morphologic changes which occur naturally in the adult brain.", "25761571": "Pavlovian cues associated with junk-foods (caloric, highly sweet, and/or fatty foods), like the smell of brownies, can elicit craving to eat and increase the amount of food consumed. People who are more susceptible to these motivational effects of food cues may have a higher risk for becoming obese. Further, overconsumption of junk-foods leading to the development of obesity may itself heighten attraction to food cues. Here, we used a model of individual susceptibility to junk-foods diet-induced obesity to determine whether there are  pre-existing and/or diet-induced increases in attraction to and motivation for sucrose-paired cues (ie, incentive salience or 'wanting'). We also assessed diet- vs obesity-associated alterations in mesolimbic function and receptor expression. We found that rats susceptible to diet-induced obesity displayed heightened conditioned approach prior to the development of obesity. In addition, after junk-food diet exposure, those rats that developed obesity also showed increased  willingness to gain access to a sucrose cue. Heightened 'wanting' was not due to  individual differences in the hedonic impact ('liking') of sucrose. Neurobiologically, Mu opioid receptor mRNA expression was lower in striatal 'hot-spots' that generate eating or hedonic impact only in those rats that became obese. In contrast, prolonged exposure to junk-food resulted in cross-sensitization to amphetamine-induced locomotion and downregulation of striatal D2R mRNA regardless of the development of obesity. Together these data shed light on individual differences in behavioral and neurobiological consequences of exposure to junk-food diets and the potential contribution of incentive sensitization in susceptible individuals to greater food cue-triggered  motivation.", "26715366": "Environmental reward-predictive stimuli provide a major source of motivation for  instrumental reward-seeking activity and this has been linked to dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core. This cue-induced incentive motivation can be quite general, not restricted to instrumental actions that earn the same unique reward, and is also typically regulated by one's current need state, such that cues only motivate actions when this is adaptive. But it remains unknown whether cue-evoked dopamine signaling is similarly regulated by need state. Here, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to monitor dopamine concentration changes in the NAc core of rats during a Pavlovian-to-instrumental  transfer task in which the motivating influence of two cues, each signaling a distinct food reward (sucrose or food pellets), over an action earning a third unique food reward (polycose) was assessed in a state of hunger and of satiety. Both cues elicited a robust NAc dopamine response when hungry. The magnitude of the sucrose cue-evoked dopamine response correlated with the Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer effect that was selectively induced by this stimulus. Satiety attenuated these cue-evoked dopamine responses and behavioral responding, even though rats had never experienced the specific food rewards in this state. These data demonstrate that cue-evoked NAc core responses are sensitive to current need state, one critical variable that determines the current adaptive utility of cue-motivated behavior. Food-predictive stimuli motivate food-seeking behavior. Here, we show that food cues evoke a robust nucleus accumbens core dopamine response when hungry that correlates with the cue's ability to invigorate general food seeking. This response is attenuated when sated, demonstrating that food cue-evoked accumbens dopamine responses are sensitive to the need state information that determines the current adaptive utility of cue-motivated action.", "26503322": "Insulin activates insulin receptors (InsRs) in the hypothalamus to signal satiety after a meal. However, the rising incidence of obesity, which results in chronically elevated insulin levels, implies that insulin may also act in brain centres that regulate motivation and reward. We report here that insulin can amplify action potential-dependent dopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and caudate-putamen through an indirect mechanism that involves striatal cholinergic interneurons that express InsRs. Furthermore, two different chronic diet manipulations in rats, food restriction (FR) and an obesogenic (OB) diet, oppositely alter the sensitivity of striatal DA release to insulin, with enhanced responsiveness in FR, but loss of responsiveness in OB. Behavioural studies show  that intact insulin levels in the NAc shell are necessary for acquisition of preference for the flavour of a paired glucose solution. Together, these data imply that striatal insulin signalling enhances DA release to influence food choices.", "24804846": "Drug addiction is marked by pathological drug seeking and intense drug craving, particularly in response to drug-related stimuli. Repeated psychostimulant administration is known to induce long-term alterations in mesolimbic dopamine (DA) signaling that are hypothesized to mediate this heightened sensitivity to environmental stimuli. However, there is little direct evidence that drug-induced alteration in mesolimbic DA function underlies this hypersensitivity to motivational cues. In the current study, we tested this hypothesis using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to monitor phasic DA signaling in the nucleus accumbens core of cocaine-pretreated (6 once-daily injections of 15\u2009mg/kg, i.p.)  and drug-naive rats during a test of cue-evoked incentive motivation for food-the Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer task. We found that prior cocaine exposure augmented both reward seeking and DA release triggered by the presentation of a reward-paired cue. Furthermore, cue-evoked DA signaling positively correlated with cue-evoked food seeking and was found to be a statistical mediator of this behavioral effect of cocaine. Taken together, these findings provide support for  the hypothesis that repeated cocaine exposure enhances cue-evoked incentive motivation through augmented phasic mesolimbic DA signaling. This work sheds new  light on a fundamental neurobiological mechanism underlying motivated behavior and its role in the expression of compulsive reward seeking.", "18626092": "Pavlovian stimuli previously paired with food can markedly elevate the rate of food-reinforced instrumental responding. This effect, termed Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT), depends both on general activating and specific cueing properties of Pavlovian stimuli. Recent evidence suggests that the general activating properties of Pavlovian stimuli are mediated by mesoaccumbens dopamine systems; however, the role of NAC dopamine D1 and D2 receptors is still unknown. Here we examined the effects of a selective dopamine  D1 and D2 receptor blockade in the shell and core subregion of the NAC on general PIT. Rats were trained to press a single lever for food, and the effect of a single Pavlovian stimulus previously associated with the same food on performance of that lever was measured in extinction. Results reveal that PIT, that is, the increase in instrumental responding during presentation of the Pavlovian stimulus, was reduced by microinjections of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 and, less pronounced, by microinjections of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist raclopride into the NAC core or shell, respectively. Our data suggest  that dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the NAC core and shell mediate the general activating effects of Pavlovian stimuli on instrumental behavior.", "18037926": "The effects of nicotine on dopamine transmission from mesostriatal dopamine neurons are central to its reinforcing properties. Only recently however, has the influence of presynaptic nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) on dopaminergic axon terminals within striatum begun to be understood. Here, rather than simply enhancing (or inhibiting) dopamine release, nAChRs perform the role of a presynaptic filter, whose influence on dopamine release probability depends on presynaptic activity in dopaminergic as well as cholinergic neurons. Both mesostriatal dopaminergic neurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons play key  roles in motivational and sensorimotor processing by the basal ganglia. Moreover, it appears that the striatal influence of dopamine and ACh cannot be fully appreciated without an understanding of their reciprocal interactions. We will review the powerful filtering by nAChRs of striatal dopamine release and discuss  its dependence on activity in dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons. We will also  review how nicotine, acting via nAChR desensitization, promotes the sensitivity of dopamine synapses to activity. This filtering action might provide a mechanism through which nicotine promotes how burst activity in dopamine neurons facilitates goal-directed behaviour and reinforcement processing. More generally, it indicates that we should not restrict our view of presynaptic nAChRs to simply enhancing neurotransmitter release. We will also summarize current understanding  of the forms and functions of the diverse nAChRs purported to exist on dopaminergic axons. A greater understanding of nAChR form and function is imperative to guide the design of ligands with subtype-selective efficacy for improved therapeutic interventions in nicotine addiction as well as Parkinson's disease.", "18033235": "Modulation of striatal dopamine (DA) neurotransmission plays a fundamental role in the reinforcing and ultimately addictive effects of nicotine. Nicotine, by desensitizing beta2 subunit-containing (beta2*) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on striatal DA axons, significantly enhances how DA is released by reward-related burst activity compared to nonreward-related tonic activity. This  action provides a synaptic mechanism for nicotine to facilitate the DA-dependent  reinforcement. The subfamily of beta2*-nAChRs responsible for these potent synaptic effects could offer a molecular target for therapeutic strategies in nicotine addiction. We explored the role of alpha6beta2*-nAChRs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and caudate-putamen (CPu) by observing action potential-dependent DA release from synapses in real-time using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at carbon-fiber microelectrodes in mouse striatal slices. The alpha6-specific antagonist alpha-conotoxin-MII suppressed DA release evoked by single and low-frequency action potentials and concurrently enhanced release by high-frequency bursts in a manner similar to the beta2*-selective antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine (DHbetaE) in NAc, but less so in CPu. The greater role  for alpha6*-nAChRs in NAc was not due to any confounding regional difference in ACh tone since elevated ACh levels (after the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ambenonium) had similar outcomes in NAc and CPu. Rather, there appear to be underlying differences in nAChR subtype function in NAc and CPu. In summary, we reveal that alpha6beta2*-nAChRs dominate the effects of nicotine on DA release in NAc, whereas in CPu their role is minor alongside other beta2*-nAChRs (eg alpha4*), These data offer new insights to suggest striatal alpha6*-nAChRs as a molecular target for a therapeutic strategy for nicotine addiction.", "2303856": "Intracellular recordings were made in vivo from 9 giant aspiny neurons in the neostriatum of urethane-anesthetized rats. The cells were identified by intracellular staining with HRP or biocytin. The neurons exhibited morphological  features typical of neostriatal cholinergic interneurons. Six of the cells were obtained from intact animals, while 3 were recorded from rats with ipsilateral hemidecortications. Giant aspiny neurons were characterized by their slow irregular but tonic (3-10/sec) spontaneous activity and long-duration action potentials. Examination of the underlying membrane potential trajectories during  spontaneous firing revealed that individual action potentials were triggered from spontaneous small (1-5 mV) depolarizing potentials. These spontaneous potentials  exhibited the voltage sensitivity of ordinary EPSPs. They were much less frequent during the 80-200 msec pause in tonic afferent input that follows the excitation  evoked by cortical or thalamic stimulation, and were decreased in frequency in decorticate animals. Their rise times and half-widths matched those expected for  unitary synaptic potentials placed proximally on the surface of the neurons. Low-intensity stimulation of neostriatal afferents produced small short-latency EPSPs that appeared to be composed of responses identical to the spontaneous depolarizing potentials. The latencies of the EPSPs evoked from the cerebral cortex and thalamus were consistent with a monosynaptic input from both structures, but the maximal size of the EPSPs was much smaller than that evoked in spiny neurons, suggesting that a smaller number of afferent inputs make synapses with each of the aspiny cells. Giant aspiny neurons exhibited much larger input resistances and longer time constants than spiny neostriatal neurons. They also exhibited relatively linear steady-state current-voltage relationship compared to spiny projection cells. Input resistances ranged from 71-105 M omega, and time constants ranged from 17.8-28.5 msec. Analysis of the charging transients in response to current pulses yielded estimates of dendritic  length of approximately 1 length constant. Repetitive firing of the neurons was limited by a powerful spike afterhyperpolarization and by a strong spike frequency adaptation. The sensitivity of the giant aspiny interneuron to a relatively small number of proximal afferent synaptic contacts, its tonic firing, and its widespread dendritic and axonal fields place it in an excellent position  to act as a modulator of the excitability of neostriatal projection neurons in advance of the onset of movement-related neostriatal activity.", "24535653": "RATIONALE: Chronic food restriction (FR) increases behavioral responsiveness to drugs of abuse and associated environments. Pre- and postsynaptic neuroadaptations have been identified in the mesoaccumbens dopamine pathway of FR subjects but the mechanistic basis of increased drug reward magnitude remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: Effects of FR on basal and D-amphetamine-induced trafficking of AMPA  receptor subunits to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) postsynaptic density (PSD) were  examined, and AMPA receptor involvement in augmentation of D-amphetamine reward was tested. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FR and ad libitum fed (AL) rats were injected with D-amphetamine (2.5\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle. Brains were harvested and subcellular fractionation and Western analyses were used to assess AMPA receptor abundance in NAc homogenate and PSD fractions. A follow-up experiment used a curve-shift protocol of intracranial self-stimulation to assess the effect of 1-naphthylacetyl spermine (1-NASPM), a blocker of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors, on rewarding effects of D-amphetamine microinjected in NAc shell. RESULTS: FR increased GluA1 in the PSD, and D-amphetamine increased p-Ser845-GluA1, GluA1, GluA2, but not GluA3, with a greater effect in FR than AL  rats. D-amphetamine lowered reward thresholds, with greater effects in FR than AL rats, and 1-NASPM selectively reversed the enhancing effect of FR. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that FR leads to increased synaptic incorporation of GluA1 homomers to potentiate rewarding effects of appetitive stimuli and, as a maladaptive byproduct, D-amphetamine. The D-amphetamine-induced increase in synaptic p-Ser845-GluA1, GluA1, and GluA2 may contribute to the rewarding effect  of D-amphetamine, but may also be a mechanism of synaptic strengthening and behavior modification.", "23554493": "The mechanisms by which natural rewards such as sugar affect synaptic transmission and behavior are largely unexplored. Here, we investigate regulation of nucleus accumbens synapses by sucrose intake. Previous studies have shown that AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking is a major mechanism for regulating synaptic strength, and that in vitro, trafficking of AMPARs containing the GluA1 subunit takes place by a two-step mechanism involving extrasynaptic and then synaptic receptor transport. We report that in rat, repeated daily ingestion of a 25% sucrose solution transiently elevated spontaneous locomotion and potentiated accumbens core synapses through incorporation of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors  (CPARs), which are GluA1-containing, GluA2-lacking AMPARs. Electrophysiological,  biochemical, and quantitative electron microscopy studies revealed that sucrose training (7 d) induced a stable (>24 h) intraspinous GluA1 population, and that in these rats a single sucrose stimulus rapidly (5 min) but transiently (<24 h) elevated GluA1 at extrasynaptic sites. CPARs and dopamine D1 receptors were required in vivo for elevated locomotion after sucrose ingestion. Significantly,  a 7 d protocol of daily ingestion of a 3% solution of saccharin, a noncaloric sweetener, induced synaptic GluA1 similarly to 25% sucrose ingestion. These findings identify multistep GluA1 trafficking, previously described in vitro, as  a mechanism for acute regulation of synaptic transmission in vivo by a natural orosensory reward. Trafficking is stimulated by a chemosensory pathway that is not dependent on the caloric value of sucrose.", "23354537": "RATIONALE: Chronic food restriction (FR) increases rewarding effects of abused drugs and persistence of a cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP). When there is a single daily meal, circadian rhythms are correspondingly entrained, and pre- and postprandial periods are accompanied by different circulating levels of metabolic hormones that modulate brain dopamine function. OBJECTIVES: The present study assessed whether rewarding effects of d-amphetamine, cocaine, and persistence of cocaine-CPP differ between FR subjects tested in the pre- and postprandial periods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were stereotaxically implanted with intracerebral microinjection cannulae and an electrode in lateral hypothalamus. Rewarding effects of d-amphetamine and cocaine were assessed using electrical self-stimulation in rats tested 1-4 or 18-21\u00a0h after the daily meal. Nonimplanted subjects acquired a cocaine-CPP while ad libitum fed and then were switched to FR and tested for CPP at these same times. RESULTS: Rewarding effects of intranucleus accumbens (NAc) d-amphetamine, intraventricular cocaine, and persistence of cocaine-CPP did not differ between rats tested 18-21 h food-deprived, when ghrelin and insulin levels were at peak and nadir, respectively, and those tested 1-4\u00a0h after feeding. Rats that expressed a persistent CPP had elevated levels of p-ERK1, GluA1, and p-Ser845-GluA1 in NAc core, and the latter correlated with CPP expression. CONCLUSIONS: Psychostimulant reward and persistence of CPP in FR rats are unaffected by time of testing relative to the daily meal. Further, NAc biochemical responses previously associated with enhanced drug responsiveness in  FR rats are associated with persistent CPP expression.", "22356698": "Distinct subsets of nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons differentially encode goal-directed behaviors for natural vs. drug rewards [R. M. Carelli et al. (2000)The Journal of Neuroscience, 20, 4255-4266], and the encoding of cocaine-seeking is altered following cocaine abstinence [J. A. Hollander & R. M.  Carelli (2007) The Journal of Neuroscience, 27, 3535-3539]. Here, electrophysiological recording procedures were used to determine if the selective encoding of natural vs. cocaine reward by NAc neurons is: (i) maintained when the natural reinforcer is a highly palatable sweet tastant and (ii) altered by cocaine abstinence. Rats (n = 14) were trained on a multiple schedule of sucrose  reinforcement and cocaine self-administration (2-3 weeks) and NAc activity was recorded during the task before and after 30 days of cocaine abstinence. Of 130 cells recorded before abstinence, 82 (63%) displayed patterned discharges (increases or decreases in firing rate, termed phasic activity) relative to operant responding for sucrose or cocaine. As in previous reports, the majority of those cells displayed nonoverlapping patterns of activity during responding for sucrose vs. cocaine. Specifically, only 17 (21%) showed similar patterns of activity (i.e. overlapping activity) across the two reinforcer conditions. After  abstinence, this pattern was largely maintained, 23 of 70 phasic cells (33%) were overlapping. However, cocaine abstinence altered the overall percentage of selectively active neurons across reinforcer conditions. Specifically, significantly more neurons became selectively activated during cocaine-directed behaviors than during sucrose-directed behaviors. The results indicate that, although the selective encoding of cocaine and natural rewards is maintained even with a highly palatable substance, 30 days of cocaine abstinence dynamically alters the overall population encoding of natural and drug rewards by NAc neurons.", "21338878": "Food is consumed in order to maintain energy balance at homeostatic levels. In addition, palatable food is also consumed for its hedonic properties independent  of energy status. Such reward-related consumption can result in caloric intake exceeding requirements and is considered a major culprit in the rapidly increasing rates of obesity in developed countries. Compared with homeostatic mechanisms of feeding, much less is known about how hedonic systems in brain influence food intake. Intriguingly, excessive consumption of palatable food can  trigger neuroadaptive responses in brain reward circuitries similar to drugs of abuse. Furthermore, similar genetic vulnerabilities in brain reward systems can increase predisposition to drug addiction and obesity. Here, recent advances in our understanding of the brain circuitries that regulate hedonic aspects of feeding behavior will be reviewed. Also, emerging evidence suggesting that obesity and drug addiction may share common hedonic mechanisms will also be considered.", "19931598": "Previous findings suggest that neuroadaptations downstream of D-1 dopamine (DA) receptor stimulation in nucleus accumbens (NAc) are involved in the enhancement of drug reward by chronic food restriction (FR). Given the high co-expression of  D-1 and GluR1 AMPA receptors in NAc, and the regulation of GluR1 channel conductance and trafficking by D-1-linked intracellular signaling cascades, the present study examined effects of the D-1 agonist, SKF-82958, on NAc GluR1 phosphorylation, intracranial electrical self-stimulation reward (ICSS), and reversibility of reward effects by a polyamine GluR1 antagonist, 1-NA-spermine, in ad libitum fed (AL) and FR rats. Systemically administered SKF-82958, or brief ingestion of a 10% sucrose solution, increased NAc GluR1 phosphorylation on Ser845, but not Ser831, with a greater effect in FR than AL rats. Microinjection  of SKF-82958 in NAc shell produced a reward-potentiating effect that was greater  in FR than AL rats, and was reversed by co-injection of 1-NA-spermine. GluR1 abundance in whole cell and synaptosomal fractions of NAc did not differ between  feeding groups, and microinjection of AMPA, while affecting ICSS, did not exert greater effects in FR than AL rats. These results suggest a role of NAc GluR1 in  the reward-potentiating effect of D-1 DA receptor stimulation and its enhancement by FR. Moreover, GluR1 involvement appears to occur downstream of D-1 DA receptor stimulation rather than reflecting a basal increase in GluR1 expression or function. Based on evidence that phosphorylation of GluR1 on Ser845 primes synaptic strengthening, the present results may reflect a mechanism via which FR  normally facilitates reward-related learning to re-align instrumental behavior with environmental contingencies under the pressure of negative energy balance.", "19217372": "The ability to change behavior likely depends on the selective strengthening and  weakening of brain synapses. The cellular models of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) of synaptic strength, can be expressed by the synaptic insertion or removal of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), respectively. We here present an overview of studies that have used animal models to show that such AMPAR trafficking underlies several experience-driven phenomena-from neuronal circuit formation to the modification of behavior. We argue that monitoring and manipulating synaptic AMPAR trafficking represents an attractive means to study cognitive function and dysfunction in animal models.", "12831870": "It is well established that chronic food restriction enhances sensitivity to the  rewarding and motor-activating effects of abused drugs. However, neuroadaptations underlying these behavioral effects have not been characterized. The purpose of the present study was to explore the possibility that food restriction produces increased dopamine (DA) receptor function that is evident in behavior, signal transduction, and immediate early gene expression. In the first two experiments,  rats received intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of the D1 DA receptor agonist SKF-82958, and the D2/3 DA receptor agonist quinpirole. Both agonists produced greater motor-activating effects in food-restricted than ad libitum-fed  rats. In addition, Fos-immunostaining induced by SKF-82958 in caudate-putamen (CPu) and nucleus accumbens (Nac) was greater in food-restricted than ad libitum-fed rats, as was staining induced by quinpirole in globus pallidus and ventral pallidum. In the next two experiments, neuronal membranes prepared from CPu and Nac were exposed to SKF-82958 and quinpirole. Despite the documented involvement of cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling in D1 DA receptor-mediated c-fos induction, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity by SKF-82958 in CPu and  Nac did not differ between groups. Food restriction did, however, decrease AC stimulation by the direct enzyme stimulant, forskolin, but not NaF or MnCl(2), suggesting a shift in AC expression to a less catalytically efficient isoform. Finally, food restriction increased quinpirole-stimulated [(35)S]guanosine triphosphate-gammaS binding in CPu, suggesting that increased functional coupling between D2 DA receptors and G(i) may account for the augmented behavioral and pallidal c-Fos responses to quinpirole. Results of this study support the hypothesis that food restriction leads to neuroadaptations at the level of postsynaptic D1 and D2 receptor-bearing cells which, in turn, mediate augmented behavioral and transcriptional responses to DA. The signaling pathways mediating  these augmented responses remain to be fully elucidated.", "12049934": "Newly discovered features of the trafficking of AMPA receptors to and from the postsynaptic membrane of excitatory synapses are now bringing the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity into focus. Recent advances, including the existence of slots, anchors, transport factors and pathways for activity-dependent control, have elucidated the role of the individual AMPA receptor subunits and their binding partners. The latest views describe how subunit type dictates the assembly of heteromeric receptors, and how these heteromers interact with the receptor trafficking machinery and synaptic anchorage factors. Moreover, phosphorylation may play an important role in receptor transport and synaptic turnover.", "9736668": "Chronic food restriction increases the systemic self-administration and locomotor-stimulating effect of abused drugs. However, it is not clear whether these behavioral changes reflect enhanced rewarding potency or a CNS-based modulatory process. The purpose of this study was to determine whether food restriction specifically increases the rewarding potency of drugs, as indexed by  their threshold-lowering effect on lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation, and whether any such effect can be attributed to an enhanced central response rather  than changes in drug disposition. When drugs were administered systemically, food restriction potentiated the threshold-lowering effect of amphetamine (0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), phencyclidine (1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mg/kg, i.p.), and dizocilpine (MK-801) (0.0125, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) but not nicotine (0.15,  0.3, 0.45 mg/kg, s.c.). When amphetamine (25.0, 50.0, and 100.0 microgram) and MK-801 (5.0, 10.0, and 20.0 microgram) were administered via the intracerebroventricular route, food restriction again potentiated the threshold-lowering effects and increased the locomotor-stimulating effects of both drugs. These results indicate that food restriction increases the sensitivity of neural substrates for rewarding and stimulant effects of drugs. In light of work that attributes rewarding effects of MK-801 to blockade of NMDA receptors on medium spiny neurons in nucleus accumbens, the elements affected by  food restriction may lie downstream from the mesoaccumbens dopamine neurons whose terminals are the site of amphetamine-rewarding action. Possible metabolic-endocrine triggers of this effect are discussed, as is the likelihood that mechanisms mediating the modulatory effect of food restriction differ from those mediating sensitization by intermittent drug exposure.", "11842442": "Forebrain dopamine release is under the local control of D2 family (D2 and D3) autoreceptors. In this study, autoreceptor-mediated modulation of forebrain dopamine release was investigated using amperometry in brain slices following local electrical stimulation. 350 microm-thick slices of nucleus accumbens or dorsolateral neostriatum were prepared from male Wistar rats (150-200 g) and superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 32 degrees C. Dopamine release  was evoked by electrical pulses (0.1 ms, 10 mA) across bipolar tungsten stimulating electrodes and measured at carbon fibre microelectrodes using fixed potential amperometry (+300 mV vs. Ag/AgCl). Peak dopamine release on stimulation (single pulse) was 0.75 microM (neostriatum) and 1.37 microM (nucleus accumbens). Metoclopramide (1 microM) had no significant effect on DA efflux from a single pulse in either region. Using paired pulse stimuli, dopamine release on the second pulse varied according to the interval between the two pulses. At very long intervals (>20 sec), dopamine release was similar to that for the first pulse. At shorter intervals, dopamine efflux was attenuated. Metoclopramide had no effect on second pulse dopamine release when the pulse was applied at short (<0.1 sec) or long (>5.0 sec) intervals after the first. At intermediate intervals, metoclopramide significantly increased second pulse dopamine release.  The peak dopamine autoreceptor effect occurred at approximately 550 ms in neostriatum and approximately 700 ms in nucleus accumbens. The onset time is due  both to diffusion of dopamine from the release sites to the autoreceptors and receptor-effector mechanisms. These findings may have implications for the local  control of forebrain dopamine function in physiological and pathological states.", "22238334": "Excessive consumption of alcohol is among the leading causes of preventable death worldwide. Although ethanol modulates a variety of molecular targets, including several neurotransmitter receptors, the neural mechanisms that underlie its rewarding actions and lead to excessive consumption are unknown. Studies in animals suggest that release of endogenous opioids by ethanol promotes further consumption. To examine this issue in humans and to determine where in the brain  endogenous opioids act to promote alcohol consumption, we measured displacement of a radiolabeled \u03bc opioid receptor agonist, [\u00b9\u00b9C]carfentanil, before and immediately after alcohol consumption in both heavy drinkers and control subjects. Drinking alcohol induced opioid release in the nucleus accumbens and orbitofrontal cortex, areas of the brain implicated in reward valuation. Opioid release in the orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens was significantly positively correlated. Furthermore, changes in orbitofrontal cortex binding correlated significantly with problem alcohol use and subjective high in heavy drinkers, suggesting that differences in endogenous opioid function in these regions contribute to excessive alcohol consumption. These results also suggest a possible mechanism by which opioid antagonists such as naltrexone act to treat alcohol abuse.", "17291784": "OBJECTIVE: Alcohol dependence may be associated with dysfunction of mesolimbic circuitry, such that anticipation of nonalcoholic reward fails to activate the ventral striatum, while alcohol-associated cues continue to activate this region. This may lead alcoholics to crave the pharmacological effects of alcohol to a greater extent than other conventional rewards. The present study investigated neural mechanisms underlying these phenomena. METHODS: 16 detoxified male alcoholics and 16 age-matched healthy volunteers participated in two fMRI paradigms. In the first paradigm, alcohol-associated and affectively neutral pictures were presented, whereas in the second paradigm, a monetary incentive delay task (MID) was performed, in which brain activation during anticipation of monetary gain and loss was examined. For both paradigms, we assessed the association of alcohol craving with neural activation to incentive cues. RESULTS: Detoxified alcoholics showed reduced activation of the ventral striatum  during anticipation of monetary gain relative to healthy controls, despite similar performance. However, alcoholics showed increased ventral striatal activation in response to alcohol-associated cues. Reduced activation in the ventral striatum during expectation of monetary reward, and increased activation  during presentation of alcohol cues were correlated with alcohol craving in alcoholics, but not healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that mesolimbic activation in alcoholics is biased towards processing of alcohol cues. This might explain why alcoholics find it particularly difficult to focus on conventional reward cues and engage in alternative rewarding activities.", "12827641": "Microdialysis experiments in rodents indicate that ethanol promotes dopamine release predominantly in the nucleus accumbens, a phenomenon that is implicated in the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis in humans that an oral dose of ethanol would lead to dopamine release in the ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens. Six healthy subjects underwent two [(11)C]raclopride PET scans following either alcohol (1 ml/kg) in orange juice or orange juice alone. Subjective mood changes, heart rate, and blood-alcohol levels were monitored throughout the procedure. Personality traits were evaluated using the tridimensional personality questionnaire. PET images were co-registered with MRI and transformed into stereotaxic space. Statistical parametric maps of [(11)C]raclopride binding potential change were generated. There was a significant reduction in [(11)C]raclopride binding potential bilaterally in the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens in the alcohol condition compared to the orange juice condition, indicative of increased extracellular dopamine. Moreover, the magnitude of the change in [(11)C]raclopride binding correlated with the alcohol-induced increase  in heart rate, which is thought to be a marker of the psychostimulant effects of  the drug, and with the personality dimension of impulsiveness. The present study  is the first report that, in humans, alcohol promotes dopamine release in the brain, with a preferential effect in the ventral striatum. These findings support the hypothesis that mesolimbic dopamine activation is a common property of abused substances, possibly mediating their reinforcing effects.", "15924857": "In this article we develop the concept that the hippocampus and the midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) form a functional loop.  Activation of the loop begins when the hippocampus detects newly arrived information that is not already stored in its long-term memory. The resulting novelty signal is conveyed through the subiculum, accumbens, and ventral pallidum to the VTA where it contributes (along with salience and goal information) to the novelty-dependent firing of these cells. In the upward arm of the loop, dopamine  (DA) is released within the hippocampus; this produces an enhancement of LTP and  learning. These findings support a model whereby the hippocampal-VTA loop regulates the entry of information into long-term memory.", "22171047": "The nucleus accumbens shell (NAc) is a key brain region mediating emotional and motivational learning. In rodent models, dynamic alterations have been observed in synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) within the NAc following incentive stimuli, and some of these alterations are critical for acquiring new emotional/motivational states. NMDARs are prominent molecular devices for controlling neural plasticity and memory formation. Although synaptic NMDARs are  predominately located postsynaptically, recent evidence suggests that they may also exist at presynaptic terminals and reshape excitatory synaptic transmission  by regulating presynaptic glutamate release. However, it remains unknown whether  presynaptic NMDARs exist in the NAc and contribute to emotional and motivational  learning. In an attempt to identify presynaptically located NMDARs in the NAc, the present study uses slice electrophysiology combined with pharmacological and  genetic tools to examine the physiological role of the putative presynaptic NMDARs in rats. Our results show that application of glycine, the glycine-site agonist of NMDARs, potentiated presynaptic release of glutamate at excitatory synapses on NAc neurons, whereas application of 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid or 7-chlorokynurenic acid, the glycine-site antagonists of NMDARs, produced the opposite effect. However, these seemingly presynaptic NMDAR-mediated effects could not be prevented by application of d-APV, the glutamate-site NMDAR antagonist, and were still present in the mice in which NMDAR NR1 or NR3 subunits were genetically deleted. Thus, rather than suggesting the existence of presynaptic NMDARs, our results support the idea that an unidentified type of glycine-activated substrate may account for the presynaptic effects appearing to  be mediated by NMDARs.", "21653866": "Choices between certain and uncertain rewards of different magnitudes have been proposed to be mediated by both the frontal lobes and the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system. In rats, systemic manipulations of DA activity or inactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) disrupt decision making about  risks and rewards. However, it is unclear how PFC DA transmission contributes to  these processes. We addressed this issue by examining the effects of pharmacological manipulations of D(1) and D(2) receptors in the medial (prelimbic) PFC on choice between small, certain and large, yet probabilistic rewards. Rats were trained on a probabilistic discounting task where one lever delivered one pellet with 100% probability, and the other delivered four pellets, but the probability of receiving reward decreased across blocks of trials (100, 50, 25, 12.5%). D(1) blockade (SCH23390) in the medial PFC decreased preference for the large/risky option. In contrast, D(2) blockade (eticlopride) reduced probabilistic discounting and increased risky choice. The D(1) agonist SKF81297 caused a slight, nonsignificant increase in preference for the large/risky lever. However, D(2) receptor stimulation (quinpirole) induced a true impairment in decision making, flattening the discounting curve and biasing choice away from or toward the risky option when it was more or less advantageous, respectively. These findings suggest that PFC D(1) and D(2) receptors make dissociable, yet complementary, contributions to risk/reward judgments. By striking a fine balance between D(1)/D(2) receptor activity, DA may help refine these judgments, promoting either exploitation of current favorable circumstances or exploration of more profitable ones when conditions change.", "9065518": "The activation of mu-opioid receptors in the nucleus accumbens (Acb) produces changes in locomotor and rewarding responses that are believed to involve neurons, including local gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons. We combined immunogold-silver detection of an antipeptide antiserum against the cloned mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and immunoperoxidase labeling of an antibody against GABA to determine the cellular basis for the proposed opioid modulation of GABAergic neurons in the rat Acb. MOR-like immunoreactivity (MOR-LI) was localized prominently to plasma membranes of neurons having morphological features of both spiny and aspiny cells, many of which contained GABA. Of 351 examples of profiles that contained MOR-LI and GABA labeling, 65% were dendrites. In these dendrites, MOR-LI was seen mainly along extrasynaptic portions of the plasma membrane apposed to unlabeled terminals and/or glial processes. Dually labeled dendrites often received convergent input from GABAergic terminals and/or from unlabeled terminals forming asymmetric excitatory-type synapses. Of all profiles that contained both MOR and GABA immunoreactivity, 28% were axon terminals. MOR-containing GABAergic terminals and terminals separately labeled for MOR or GABA formed synapses with unlabeled dendrites and also with dendrites  containing MOR or GABA. Our results indicate that MOR agonists could modulate the activity of GABA neurons in the Acb via receptors located mainly at extrasynaptic sites on dendritic plasma membranes. MOR ligands also could alter the release of  GABA onto target dendrites that contain GABA and/or respond to opiate stimulation.", "7083004": "The possibility that morphine exerts in reinforcing effects via an action in the  nucleus accumbens was investigated in the rat using the self-administration model and the method of intracerebral injection. Male, adult rats implanted with a chronic cannula aimed at this nucleus were tested for self-administration in a rectangular chamber equipped with two levers, one at each end. Each subject was given several sessions in blocks of two sessions for a given substance, the first session with the active lever at one end of the chamber, the next with the active lever at the other end. During a session, responses on the inactive lever were without consequences. Depression of the active lever was coupled with the presentation of a tone to facilitate discrimination between the two levers. All subjects received a sequence of 5 sessions, the first for habituation, the next two to test for effects of artificial cerebrospinal fluid, and the next two to test for effects of morphine. A few subjects in which the cannula had not been dislodged or plugged were further tested for effects of morphine and then for effects of morphine mixed with naloxone. Each response on the active lever resulted in an injection of 0.02 microliter. During the morphine sessions, this volume contained 0.2 microgram of the opiate; during the sessions of morphine and naloxone, this volume contained 0.2 microgram morphine mixed with 0.2 microgram naloxone. The results show that self-administration was induced and maintained when morphine was injected inside the nucleus accumbens, not in an area outside this region but at the same brain level. The rate or responding on the active lever for morphine was higher than for artificial cerebrospinal fluid and it showed a pattern of gradual increase over time. In contrast, the rate of responding on the inactive lever during the morphine sessions showed a decline. This pattern was not evident in these animals during control sessions and in the  animals in which the injections were outside the n. accumbens. These results are  interpreted to indicate that the n. accumbens may be part of a system of structures mediating the reinforcing effects of opiates.", "19110006": "Impairments in different forms of behavioral flexibility, such as set-shifting and reversal learning, are some of the most reliable cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, and have been attributed to a disruption in frontal lobe functioning. However, recent animal studies have highlighted the distinct functional roles that different subcortical systems interconnected with  the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play in different forms of behavioral flexibility. This suggests that dysfunction in these circuits also contribute to the cognitive impairments in these processes observed in schizophrenia. The present review summarizes findings from studies that utilize or rodent studies rodents to elucidate the dissociable contributions that prefrontal cortical, striatal, thalamic and dopaminergic systems make to different component processes of behavioral flexibility, with an emphasis on set-shifting functions mediated by the medial PFC. We also review recent work investigating how different manipulations thought to model certain aspects of schizophrenia affect set-shifting and reversal learning. Lastly, we report novel data describing the effects of subchronic ketamine exposure on these forms of flexibility. Ketamine treatment reduced perseverative tendencies during set-shifting, but impaired reversal learning, suggesting a complex disruption of neural circuits related to  the nucleus accumbens shell and orbitofrontal cortex. Viewed collectively, these  findings further our understanding of how certain neural abnormalities observed in the schizophrenic brain may relate to impairments in behavioral flexibility. This information may facilitate the development of animal models that resemble the complex disruptions in neural circuitry observed in schizophrenia, which would aid in the discovery of novel targeted pharmacotheraputic approaches to ameliorate cognitive dysfunction linked to these circuits.", "21109477": "The ability to resist the urge to eat requires the proper functioning of neuronal circuits involved in top-down control to oppose the conditioned responses that predict reward from eating the food and the desire to eat the food. Imaging studies show that obese subjects might have impairments in dopaminergic pathways  that regulate neuronal systems associated with reward sensitivity, conditioning and control. It is known that the neuropeptides that regulate energy balance (homeostatic processes) through the hypothalamus also modulate the activity of dopamine cells and their projections into regions involved in the rewarding processes underlying food intake. It is postulated that this could also be a mechanism by which overeating and the resultant resistance to homoeostatic signals impairs the function of circuits involved in reward sensitivity, conditioning and cognitive control.", "25220811": "Phasic increases and decreases in dopamine (DA) transmission encode reward prediction errors thought to facilitate reward-related learning, yet how these signals guide action selection in more complex situations requiring evaluation of different reward remains unclear. We manipulated phasic DA signals while rats performed a risk/reward decision-making task, using temporally discrete stimulation of either the lateral habenula (LHb) or rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) to suppress DA bursts (confirmed with neurophysiological studies)  or the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to override phasic dips. When rats chose between small/certain and larger/risky rewards, LHb or RMTg stimulation, time-locked to delivery of one of these rewards, redirected bias toward the alternative option, whereas VTA stimulation after non rewarded choices increased  risky choice. LHb stimulation prior to choices shifted bias away from more preferred options. Thus, phasic DA signals provide feedback on whether recent actions were rewarded to update decision policies and direct actions toward more  desirable reward.", "21402915": "Several emerging theories of addiction have described how abused substances exploit vulnerabilities in decision-making processes. These vulnerabilities have  been proposed to result from pharmacologically corrupted neural mechanisms of normal brain valuation systems. High alcohol intake in rats during adolescence has been shown to increase risk preference, leading to suboptimal performance on  a decision-making task when tested in adulthood. Understanding how alcohol use corrupts decision making in this way has significant clinical implications. However, the underlying mechanism by which alcohol use increases risk preference  remains unclear. To address this central issue, we assessed dopamine neurotransmission with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry during reward valuation and risk-based decision making in rats with and without a history of adolescent alcohol intake. We specifically targeted the mesolimbic dopamine system, the site of action for virtually all abused substances. This system, which continuously develops during the adolescent period, is central to both reward processing and risk-based decision making. We report that a history of adolescent alcohol use alters dopamine signaling to risk but not to reward. Thus, a corruption of cost encoding suggests that adolescent alcohol use leads to long-term changes in decision making by altering the valuation of risk.", "21747759": "Dopaminergic signaling within the basal ganglia has classically been thought to occur within two distinct neuronal pathways; the direct striatonigral pathway which contains the dopamine D1 receptor and the neuropeptides dynorphin (DYN) and substance P, and the indirect striatopallidal pathway which expresses the dopamine D2 receptor and enkephalin (ENK). A number of studies have also shown, however, that D1 and D2 receptors can co-exist within the same medium spiny neuron and emerging evidence indicates that these D1/D2-coexpressing neurons, which also express DYN and ENK, may comprise a third neuronal pathway, with representation in both the striatonigral and striatopallidal projections of the basal ganglia. Furthermore, within these coexpressing neurons it has been shown that the dopamine D1 and D2 receptor can form a novel and pharmacologically distinct receptor complex, the dopamine D1-D2 receptor heteromer, with unique signaling properties. This is indicative of a functionally unique role for these  neurons in brain. The aim of this review is to discuss the evidence in support of a novel third pathway coexpressing the D1 and D2 receptor, to discuss the potential relevance of this pathway to basal ganglia signaling, and to address its potential value, and that of the dopamine D1-D2 receptor heteromer, in the search for new therapeutic strategies for disorders involving dopamine neurotransmission.", "9676983": "A microstructural analysis of licking behavior in nondeprived and 23-hr food-deprived rats (n = 15) presented with various sucrose solutions (0.03-1.0 M) in daily single-bottle, 1-hr sessions was conducted. Food deprivation and concentration interacted to increase total licks. The effects of food deprivation and concentration on burst size (BS), burst number (BN), and other parameters varied as a function of the pause criterion (PC; 0.3-100 s) used to define licking bursts. A rationale for selecting a 1-s PC for further analysis is presented. Despite the lack of correlations between temporally contiguous burst and pause combinations, mean BS decreased and pause duration increased as meals progressed. At the 1-s PC, BS increased linearly with concentration, implying that this microstructural parameter is influenced in part by taste. Food deprivation did not affect BS but rather increased BN and proportionally extended the meal duration.", "20506412": "CART (Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript) peptide has been implicated  in playing a modulatory role in reward and reinforcement. Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that injections of CART peptide (CART 55-102) into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) attenuated both cocaine- and dopamine-induced increases in locomotor activity (LMA), and attenuated cocaine reward as well. In this study, the effects of CART peptide on LMA induced by dopamine receptor agonists were evaluated after intraaccumbal injections in male, Sprague-Dawley rats. Effects of the D1 receptor agonist SKF-81,297, saline, CART 55-102, or CART 55-102 and SKF-81,297 together were compared. The SKF-81,297-induced increase in  LMA was potentiated by coadministration of CART, while injection of CART alone had no significant effect. Injection of the D2 agonist 7-OH-DPAT had no effect on LMA, and the combination of both 7-OH-DPAT and CART peptide also had no effect. Quinelorane, a D3 receptor agonist, did not alter LMA, nor did the combination of CART peptide and quinelorane. The next experiment examined the effects of CART peptide on LMA induced by coinjection of both the D1 agonist SKF-81,297 and the D2 agonist 7-OH-DPAT. The combination of SKF-81,297 and 7-OH-DPAT induced greater LMA than SKF-81,297 alone. Coadministration of CART peptide along with the D1 and D2 agonists reduced LMA. These results strongly suggest that CART peptide reduces the effects of psychostimulants by modulating the simultaneous activation of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors rather than by affecting the action of any individual dopamine receptor.", "18802445": "Over the past decade or so, CART (cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript)  peptides have emerged as major neurotransmitters and hormones. CART peptides are  widely distributed in the CNS and are involved in regulating many processes, including food intake and the maintenance of body weight, reward and endocrine functions. Recent studies have produced a wealth of information about the location, regulation, processing and functions of CART peptides, but additional studies aimed at elucidating the physiological effects of the peptides and at characterizing the CART receptor(s) are needed to take advantage of possible therapeutic applications.", "14698680": "The role played by the biologically active CART 55-102 peptide in NAcc AMPH induced locomotion was investigated. When microinjected alone into this site, none of the doses of CART 55-102 tested (0.1, 0.4, 1.0 or 2.5 microg/0.5 microl/side) produced effects on locomotion during a two-h test. However, when co-injected with AMPH (2.5 microg/0.5 microl/side) into the NAcc, moderately high (2.5 microg/side) and middle to high (0.4-2.5 microg/side) doses of CART 55-102 significantly attenuated the effects of AMPH on locomotion and rearing, respectively. These results indicate that CART peptides can exert an antagonistic effect on the generation of locomotion by AMPH in the NAcc.", "22864945": "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Previous research with an animal model of relapse has shown that acute food deprivation will reinstate extinguished drug seeking. Recent evidence with humans, however, suggests that chronic food restriction rather than acute food deprivation is related to increases in drug taking and relapse, emphasizing a need for an animal model to elucidate the neural mechanisms mediating the effects of chronic food restriction on drug seeking. Here we studied the effects of chronic food restriction during a period of abstinence on heroin seeking in rats. METHODS: Rats were trained to self-administer heroin over 10 days (0.1 mg/kg/infusion; i.v.). Rats were then removed from the operant conditioning chambers and exposed to a mild food restriction (resulting in 10-15 % decrease in body weight) or given unrestricted access to food for 14 days while abstinent. The abstinence period was followed by a drug-seeking test under extinction conditions. Subsequent experiments manipulated the length of restriction and test conditions. RESULTS: Rats that were food restricted throughout the abstinence period demonstrated a robust increase in cue-induced heroin seeking compared to sated rats. Re-feeding prior to testing or decreasing the length of the food restriction period prevented the augmentation of drug seeking. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of chronic food restriction and a concurrent state of  hunger appears to be necessary for an increase in cue-induced heroin seeking following abstinence. The procedure presented here may serve as a useful model to study the increased risk for relapse following dietary manipulations in abstinent subjects.", "25857550": "The ventral pallidum (VP) plays a critical role in the processing and execution of motivated behaviors. Yet this brain region is often overlooked in published discussions of the neurobiology of mental health (e.g., addiction, depression). This contributes to a gap in understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of psychiatric disorders. This review is presented to help bridge the gap by providing a resource for current knowledge of VP anatomy, projection patterns and subregional circuits, and how this organization relates to the function of VP neurons and ultimately behavior. For example, ventromedial (VPvm) and dorsolateral (VPdl) VP subregions receive projections from nucleus accumbens shell and core, respectively. Inhibitory GABAergic neurons of the VPvm project to mediodorsal thalamus, lateral hypothalamus, and ventral tegmental area, and this  VP subregion helps discriminate the appropriate conditions to acquire natural rewards or drugs of abuse, consume preferred foods, and perform working memory tasks. GABAergic neurons of the VPdl project to subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra pars reticulata, and this VP subregion is modulated by, and is necessary for, drug-seeking behavior. Additional circuits arise from nonGABAergic neuronal phenotypes that are likely to excite rather than inhibit their targets.  These subregional and neuronal phenotypic circuits place the VP in a unique position to process motivationally relevant stimuli and coherent adaptive behaviors.", "12802017": "The striatum in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry is a key neural substrate that is implicated in motor balance and procedural learning. The projection neurons in the striatum are dynamically modulated by nigrostriatal dopaminergic input and intrastriatal cholinergic input. The role of intrastriatal acetylcholine (ACh) in learning behaviors, however, remains to be fully clarified. In this investigation, we examine the involvement of intrastriatal ACh in different categories of learning by selectively ablating the striatal cholinergic neurons with use of immunotoxin-mediated cell targeting. We show that selective ablation of cholinergic neurons in the striatum impairs procedural learning in the tone-cued T-maze memory task. Spatial delayed alternation in the  T-maze learning test is also impaired by cholinergic cell elimination. In contrast, the deficit in striatal ACh transmission has no effect on motor learning in the rota-rod test or spatial learning in the Morris water-maze test or on contextual- and tone-cued conditioning fear responses. We also report that  cholinergic cell elimination adaptively up-regulates nicotinic ACh receptors not  only within the striatum but also in the cerebral cortex and substantia nigra. The present investigation indicates that cholinergic modulation in the local striatal circuit plays a pivotal role in regulation of neural circuitry involving reward-related procedural learning and working memory.", "9822755": "The novel neuropeptides called hypocretins (orexins) have recently been identified as being localized exclusively in cell bodies in a subregion of the tuberal part of the hypothalamus. The structure of the hypocretins, their accumulation in vesicles of axon terminals, and their excitatory effect on cultured hypothalamic neurons suggest that the hypocretins function in intercellular communication. To characterize these peptides further and to help understand what physiological functions they may serve, we undertook an immunohistochemical study to examine the distribution of preprohypocretin-immunoreactive neurons and fibers in the rat brain. Preprohypocretin-positive neurons were found in the perifornical nucleus and in the dorsal and lateral hypothalamic areas. These cells were distinct from those that express melanin-concentrating hormone. Although they represent a restricted  group of cells, their projections were widely distributed in the brain. We observed labeled fibers throughout the hypothalamus. The densest extrahypothalamic projection was found in the locus coeruleus. Fibers were also seen in the septal nuclei, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the paraventricular and reuniens nuclei of the thalamus, the zona incerta, the subthalamic nucleus, the central gray, the substantia nigra, the raphe nuclei, the parabrachial area, the medullary reticular formation, and the nucleus of the  solitary tract. Less prominent projections were found in cortical regions, central and anterior amygdaloid nuclei, and the olfactory bulb. These results suggest that hypocretins are likely to have a role in physiological functions in  addition to food intake such as regulation of blood pressure, the neuroendocrine  system, body temperature, and the sleep-waking cycle.", "21070820": "The mesolimbic reward pathway is implicated in stress-related psychiatric disorders and is a potential target of plasticity underlying the stress resistance produced by repeated voluntary exercise. It is unknown, however, whether rats find long-term access to running wheels rewarding, or if repeated voluntary exercise reward produces plastic changes in mesolimbic reward neurocircuitry. In the current studies, young adult, male Fischer 344 rats allowed voluntary access to running wheels for 6 weeks, but not 2 weeks, found wheel running rewarding, as measured by conditioned place preference (CPP). Consistent with prior reports and the behavioral data, 6 weeks of wheel running increased \u0394FosB/FosB immunoreactivity in the nucleus accumbens (Acb). In addition, semi quantitative in situ hybridization revealed that 6 weeks of wheel  running, compared to sedentary housing, increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA  levels in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), increased delta opioid receptor (DOR) mRNA levels in the Acb shell, and reduced levels of dopamine receptor (DR)-D2 mRNA in the Acb core. Results indicate that repeated voluntary exercise is rewarding and alters gene transcription in mesolimbic reward neurocircuitry. The  duration-dependent effects of wheel running on CPP suggest that as the weeks of wheel running progress, the rewarding effects of a night of voluntary wheel running might linger longer into the inactive cycle thus providing stronger support for CPP. The observed plasticity could contribute to the mechanisms by which exercise reduces the incidence and severity of substance abuse disorders, changes the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse, and facilitates successful coping with stress.", "17392469": "Electrophysiological recordings were completed in rats (n = 14) trained to self-administer cocaine to determine whether activation of nucleus accumbens (Acb) neurons (core vs shell) by cocaine-associated stimuli is enhanced after 1 month of cocaine abstinence. After self-administration training, 170 cells were recorded during a single test session conducted either the next day or 1 month later. The test session consisted of three phases during which (1) the cocaine cue was presented unexpectedly to rats, (2) rats responded for the same cue in the absence of the drug (extinction), and (3) the cocaine cue was presented randomly between cocaine-reinforced responding during resumption of self-administration. The cocaine stimulus significantly increased activation of Acb core (not shell) neurons after 1 month of cocaine abstinence (compared with 1 d); this finding occurred regardless of contingency of cue presentation or cocaine availability. Acb core activation was not observed in other rats (n = 7)  presented with the same stimulus never paired with cocaine. The results reflect a cellular neuroadaptation in the Acb core related to cocaine-associated cues that  is observed during initial cue exposure and sustained during extinction and resumption of self-administration after prolonged drug abstinence.", "17659381": "RATIONALE: There is evidence that lesions of the nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) promote preference for smaller earlier reinforcers over larger delayed reinforcers in inter-temporal choice paradigms. It is not known whether this reflects an effect of the lesion on the rate of delay discounting, on sensitivity to reinforcer magnitude, or both. AIM: We examined the effect of AcbC lesions on inter-temporal choice using a quantitative method that allows effects on delay discounting to be distinguished  from effects on sensitivity to reinforcer size. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen rats received bilateral quinolinic acid-induced lesions of the AcbC; 14 received sham lesions. They were trained under a discrete-trials progressive delay schedule to press two levers (A and B) for a sucrose solution. Responses on A delivered 50 microl of the solution after a delay d(A); responses on B delivered 100 microl after d(B). d(B) increased across blocks of trials, while d(A) was manipulated across phases of the experiment. Indifference delay d(B(50)) (value of d(B) corresponding to 50% choice of B) was  estimated in each phase, and linear indifference functions (d(B(50)) vs d(A)) derived. RESULTS: d(B(50)) increased linearly with d(A) (r(2) > 0.95 in each group). The intercept of the indifference function was lower in the lesioned than the sham-lesioned group; slope did not differ between groups. The lesioned rats had extensive neuronal loss in the AcbC.

In order to determine whether or not this feeding is part of a general behavioral activation, we observed the effect of intra-AcbSh DNQX injections on intake of solid food, liquid food, and water, and on gnawing behavior. In addition, we investigated the possibility that activation of a subset of these receptors with (+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) could suppress feeding. DNQX significantly increased intake of solid and liquid food, but did not significantly affect water intake or gnawing behavior. Furthermore, injections of AMPA into the AcbSh suppressed deprivation-induced feeding and intake of a palatable 5% sucrose solution without affecting water intake in water-deprived rats.

We measured GluR(1) (S845) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in rat striatal subregions in an animal model of cocaine relapse. Animals with cocaine self-administration experience and their yoked partners were exposed to extinction conditions for one hour in the drug-paired environmental context after one day or three weeks withdrawal to measure protein phosphorylation induced by the cocaine-paired context in the absence of cocaine reinforcement. GluR(1) (S845) (an index of protein kinase A (PKA) activity) and ERK phosphorylation increased in the nucleus accumbens core of self-administering but not yoked animals after three weeks (but not one day) withdrawal, indicating a time-dependent emergence of context-associated protein phosphorylation in this accumbens subregion. In comparison, animals trained to self-administer sucrose displayed a similar increase in ERK, but not GluR(1) (S845) , phosphorylation following reexposure to a sucrose-paired environment three weeks later, indicating that GluR(1) (S845) phosphorylation did not result solely from lever press behavior per se. In contrast, basal (home cage) GluR(1) (S845) phosphorylation was elevated in the nucleus accumbens shell and caudate-putamen after one day or three weeks cocaine withdrawal regardless of context exposure. These results suggest that time-dependent emergence of context-associated GluR(1) (S845) phosphorylation in the nucleus accumbens core may contribute to the persistence of cocaine-seeking behavior, whereas ERK phosphorylation may be a consequence of this behavior.", "11549750": "Drugs of abuse regulate the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in striatal regions, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc). To explore how regulation of CREB in the NAc affects behavior, we used herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors to elevate CREB expression in this region or to overexpress a dominant-negative mutant CREB (mCREB) that blocks CREB function. Rats treated with HSV-mCREB in place conditioning studies spent more time in environments associated with cocaine, indicating increased cocaine reward. Conversely, rats treated with HSV-CREB spent less time in cocaine-associated environments, indicating increased cocaine aversion. Studies in which drug-environment pairings were varied to coincide with either the early or late effects of cocaine suggest that CREB-associated place aversions reflect increased cocaine withdrawal. Because cocaine withdrawal can be accompanied by symptoms of  depression, we examined how altered CREB function in the NAc affects behavior in  the forced swim test (FST). Elevated CREB expression increased immobility in the  FST, an effect that is opposite to that caused by standard antidepressants and is consistent with a link between CREB and dysphoria. Conversely, overexpression of  mCREB decreased immobility, an effect similar to that caused by antidepressants.  Moreover, the kappa opioid receptor antagonist nor-Binaltorphimine decreased immobility in HSV-CREB- and HSV-mCREB-treated rats, suggesting that CREB-mediated induction of dynorphin (an endogenous kappa receptor ligand) contributes to immobility behavior in the FST. Exposure to the FST itself dramatically increased CREB function in the NAc. These findings raise the possibility that CREB-mediated transcription within the NAc regulates dysphoric states.", "21336273": "In a rat model of context-induced relapse to heroin, we identified sparsely distributed ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons that were activated by the heroin-associated context. Selective pharmacogenetic inactivation of these neurons inhibited context-induced drug relapse. A small subset of ventral mPFC neurons formed neuronal ensembles that encode the learned associations between heroin reward and heroin-associated contexts; re-activation of these neuronal ensembles by drug-associated contexts during abstinence provoked drug relapse.", "11449264": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used to study the operational organization of the human brain, but the exact relationship between the measured fMRI signal and the underlying neural activity is unclear. Here we present simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and fMRI responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and multi-unit spiking activity with highly spatio-temporally resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses from the visual cortex of monkeys. The largest magnitude changes were observed in LFPs, which at recording  sites characterized by transient responses were the only signal that significantly correlated with the haemodynamic response. Linear systems analysis  on a trial-by-trial basis showed that the impulse response of the neurovascular system is both animal- and site-specific, and that LFPs yield a better estimate of BOLD responses than the multi-unit responses. These findings suggest that the  BOLD contrast mechanism reflects the input and intracortical processing of a given area rather than its spiking output.", "17332411": "Stimulant addiction is often linked to excessive risk taking, sensation seeking,  and impulsivity, but in ways that are poorly understood. We report here that a form of impulsivity in rats predicts high rates of intravenous cocaine self-administration and is associated with changes in dopamine (DA) function before drug exposure. Using positron emission tomography, we demonstrated that D2/3 receptor availability is significantly reduced in the nucleus accumbens of impulsive rats that were never exposed to cocaine and that such effects are independent of DA release. These data demonstrate that trait impulsivity predicts cocaine reinforcement and that D2 receptor dysfunction in abstinent cocaine addicts may, in part, be determined by premorbid influences.", "17568396": "Homer proteins are integral components of the postsynaptic density that are necessary for alcohol-induced neuroplasticity within the nucleus accumbens (NAC). In this report, we describe the effects of chronic alcohol consumption upon NAC Homer expression and investigate the functional consequences of mimicking the alcohol-induced changes in Homer expression vis-\u00e0-vis alcohol-induced changes in  NAC neurochemistry and behavior. Chronic alcohol consumption under continuous access (3 months; daily intake approximately 11.2+/-1.5 g/kg/day) produced a robust increase in NAC Homer2 protein levels that was apparent at 2 days, 2 weeks, and 2 months following withdrawal from alcohol drinking. The increased Homer2 expression was accompanied by a less enduring elevation in total mGluR1 and NR2b levels that were evident at 2 days and 2 weeks but not at the 2-month time point. Mimicking the alcohol-induced increase in Homer2 levels by viral transfection of NAC neurons in alcohol-preferring C57BL/6J inbred mice enhanced behavioral output for alcohol reinforcement and increased alcohol intake under both preprandial and postprandial conditions. Moreover, NAC Homer2 overexpression facilitated the expression of an alcohol-conditioned place preference, as well as the development of motor tolerance. Finally, NAC Homer2 overexpression facilitated NAC glutamate and dopamine release following an acute alcohol injection and augmented alcohol-induced dopamine and glutamate sensitization, but did not affect NAC gamma-aminobutyric acid levels. Thus, an upregulation in NAC mGluR-Homer2-N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor signaling appears to be an important molecular adaptation to alcohol that promotes neuroplasticity facilitating motivational drive for alcohol and the development of alcoholism-related behaviors.", "12486182": "The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a critical integrator of neural plasticity that is responsive in a brain region-specific manner to a variety of environmental and pharmacological stimuli, including widely prescribed antidepressant medications. We developed inducible transgenic lines of mice that  express either CREB or a dominant-negative mutant of CREB (mCREB) in forebrain regions and used these mice to determine the functional significance of this transcription factor in the learned helplessness paradigm, a behavioral model of  depression. We also use a complementary viral-mediated gene transfer approach to  directly test the effect of mCREB in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region important for motivation and reward. The results demonstrate that blockade of CREB by overexpression of mCREB in transgenic mice or by viral expression of mCREB in the nucleus accumbens produces an antidepressant-like effect, whereas overexpression of CREB in transgenic mice results in the opposite phenotype. In addition, mCREB expression was colocalized with and decreased the expression of prodynorphin in nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons, and antagonism of dynorphin in the nucleus accumbens was sufficient to produce an antidepressant-like effect similar to that observed after blockade of CREB. Together, the results demonstrate that nucleus accumbens CREB-dynorphin influence behavior in the learned helplessness model and suggest that this signaling cascade may contribute to symptoms of depression.", "19285474": "Separate studies have implicated the lateral habenula (LHb) or amygdala-related regions in processing aversive stimuli, but their relationships to each other and to appetitive motivational systems are poorly understood. We show that neurons in the recently identified GABAergic rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which receive a major LHb input, project heavily to midbrain dopamine neurons, and show phasic activations and/or Fos induction after aversive stimuli (footshocks, shock-predictive cues, food deprivation, or reward omission) and inhibitions after rewards or reward-predictive stimuli. RMTg lesions markedly reduce passive  fear behaviors (freezing, open-arm avoidance) dependent on the extended amygdala, periaqueductal gray, or septum, all regions that project directly to the RMTg. In contrast, RMTg lesions spare or enhance active fear responses (treading, escape)  in these same paradigms. These findings suggest that aversive inputs from widespread brain regions and stimulus modalities converge onto the RMTg, which opposes reward and motor-activating functions of midbrain dopamine neurons.", "17241272": "The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is thought to play an important role in reward function. Two populations of neurons, containing either dopamine (DA) or gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), have been extensively characterized in this area. However, recent electrophysiological studies are consistent with the notion that neurons that utilize neurotransmitters other than DA or GABA are likely to be present in the VTA. Given the pronounced phenotypic diversity of neurons in this region, we have proposed that additional cell types, such as those that express the neurotransmitter glutamate may also be present in this area. Thus, by using in situ hybridization histochemistry we investigated whether transcripts encoded by genes for the two vesicular glutamate transporters, VGluT1 or VGluT2,  were expressed in the VTA. We found that VGluT2 mRNA but not VGluT1 mRNA is expressed in the VTA. Neurons expressing VGluT2 mRNA were differentially distributed throughout the rostro-caudal and medio-lateral aspects of the VTA, with the highest concentration detected in rostro-medial areas. Phenotypic characterization with double in situ hybridization of these neurons indicated that they rarely co-expressed mRNAs for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, marker for DAergic neurons) or glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD, marker for GABAergic neurons). Based on the results described here, we concluded that the VTA contains glutamatergic neurons that in their vast majority are clearly non-DAergic and non-GABAergic.", "1377716": "Physiological and pharmacological studies indicate that descending projections from the prefrontal cortex modulate dopaminergic transmission in the nucleus accumbens septi and ventral tegmental area. We investigated the ultrastructural bases for these interactions in rat by examining the synaptic associations between prefrontal cortical terminals labeled with anterograde markers (lesion-induced degeneration or transport of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin;  PHA-L) and neuronal processes containing immunoreactivity for the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase. Prefrontal cortical terminals in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area contained clear, round vesicles and  formed primarily asymmetric synapses on spines or small dendrites. In the ventral tegmental area, these terminals also formed asymmetric synapses on large dendrites and a few symmetric axodendritic synapses. In the nucleus accumbens septi, degenerating prefrontal cortical terminals synapsed on spiny dendrites which received convergent input from terminals containing peroxidase immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase, or from unlabeled terminals. In single sections, some tyrosine hydroxylase-labeled terminals formed thin and punctate symmetric synapses with dendritic shafts, or the heads and necks of spines. Close appositions, but not axo-axonic synapses, were frequently observed between degenerating prefrontal cortical afferents and tyrosine hydroxylase-labeled or unlabeled terminals. In the ventral tegmental area, prefrontal cortical terminals labeled with immunoperoxidase for PHA-L were in synaptic contact with dendrites containing immunogold reaction product for tyrosine hydroxylase, or with unlabeled dendrites. These results suggest that: (1) catecholaminergic (mainly dopaminergic) and prefrontal cortical terminals in the nucleus accumbens septi dually synapse on common spiny neurons; and (2) dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area receive monosynaptic input from prefrontal cortical afferents. This study provides the first ultrastructural basis for multiple sites of cellular interaction between prefrontal cortical efferents and mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons.", "22074687": "Cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) is more persistent in food-restricted  than ad libitum fed rats. This study assessed whether food restriction acts during conditioning and/or expression to increase persistence. In Experiment 1, rats were food-restricted during conditioning with a 7.0 mg/kg (i.p.) dose of cocaine. After the first CPP test, half of the rats were switched to ad libitum feeding for three weeks, half remained on food restriction, and this was followed by CPP testing. Rats tested under the ad libitum feeding condition displayed extinction by the fifth test. Their CPP did not reinstate in response to overnight food deprivation or a cocaine prime. Rats maintained on food restriction displayed a persistent CPP. In Experiment 2, rats were ad libitum fed during conditioning with the 7.0 mg/kg dose. In the first test only a trend toward CPP was displayed. Rats maintained under the ad libitum feeding condition  did not display a CPP during subsequent testing and did not respond to a cocaine  prime. Rats tested under food-restriction also did not display a CPP, but expressed a CPP following a cocaine prime. In Experiment 3, rats were ad libitum  fed during conditioning with a 12.0 mg/kg dose. After the first test, half of the rats were switched to food restriction for three weeks. Rats that were maintained under the ad libitum condition displayed extinction by the fourth test. Their CPP was not reinstated by a cocaine prime. Rats tested under food-restriction displayed a persistent CPP. These results indicate that food restriction lowers the threshold dose for cocaine CPP and interacts with a previously acquired CPP to increase its persistence. In so far as CPP models Pavlovian conditioning that  contributes to addiction, these results suggest the importance of diet and the physiology of energy balance as modulatory factors.", "11698615": "The present study aimed to characterize a functional role for group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the nucleus accumbens and the capacity of repeated cocaine to elicit long-term changes in group I mGluR function. Reverse dialysis of the group I agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) into the nucleus accumbens resulted in an increase in extracellular glutamate levels that was mediated by the mGluR1 subtype and depended on voltage-dependent Na(+) and Ca(2+) conductance. At 3 weeks after discontinuing 1  week of daily cocaine injections, the capacity of DHPG to induce glutamate release was markedly reduced. Similarly, DHPG induced an mGluR1-dependent increase in locomotor activity after microinjection into the nucleus accumbens that was significantly blunted 3 weeks after repeated cocaine administration. Signaling through group I mGluRs is regulated, in part, by Homer proteins, and it was found that the blunting of group I mGluR-induced glutamate release and motor  activity after repeated cocaine was associated with a reduction in Homer1b/c protein that was selective for the medial nucleus accumbens. These data show that repeated cocaine produces an enduring inhibition of the neurochemical and behavioral consequences of stimulating mGluR1 that is accompanied by changes in the mGluR scaffolding apparatus.", "9768834": "Author information:  (1)Department of Neuropharmacology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.", "27976722": "In addition to dopamine neurons, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) contains GABA-, glutamate- and co-releasing neurons, and recent reports suggest a complex role for the glutamate neurons in behavioural reinforcement. We report that optogenetic stimulation of VTA glutamate neurons or terminals serves as a positive reinforcer on operant behavioural assays. Mice display marked preference for brief over sustained VTA glutamate neuron stimulation resulting in behavioural responses that are notably distinct from dopamine neuron stimulation  and resistant to dopamine receptor antagonists. Whole-cell recordings reveal EPSCs following stimulation of VTA glutamate terminals in the nucleus accumbens or local VTA collaterals; but reveal both excitatory and monosynaptic inhibitory  currents in the ventral pallidum and lateral habenula, though the net effects on  postsynaptic firing in each region are consistent with the observed rewarding behavioural effects. These data indicate that VTA glutamate neurons co-release GABA in a projection-target-dependent manner and that their transient activation  drives positive reinforcement.", "23711983": "A decrease in dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) binding in the striatum is one of the most common findings in disorders that involve a dysregulation of motivation, including obesity, addiction and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. As disruption of D2R signaling in the ventral striatum--including the nucleus accumbens (NAc)--impairs motivation, we sought to determine whether potentiating  postsynaptic D2R-dependent signaling in the NAc would improve motivation. In this study, we used a viral vector strategy to overexpress postsynaptic D2Rs in either the NAc or the dorsal striatum. We investigated the effects of D2R overexpression on instrumental learning, willingness to work, use of reward value representations and modulation of motivation by reward associated cues. Overexpression of postsynaptic D2R in the NAc selectively increased motivation without altering consummatory behavior, the representation of the value of the reinforcer, or the capacity to use reward associated cues in flexible ways. In contrast, D2R overexpression in the dorsal striatum did not alter performance on  any of the tasks. Thus, consistent with numerous studies showing that reduced D2R signaling impairs motivated behavior, our data show that postsynaptic D2R overexpression in the NAc specifically increases an animal's willingness to expend effort to obtain a goal. Taken together, these results provide insight into the potential impact of future therapeutic strategies that enhance D2R signaling in the NAc.", "15657599": "Using a rat model of craving and relapse, we have previously found time-dependent increases in cue-induced cocaine seeking over the first months of withdrawal from cocaine, suggesting that drug craving incubates over time. Here, we explored the  role of the amygdala extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway in this incubation. Cocaine seeking induced by exposure to cocaine cues was substantially higher after 30 withdrawal days than after 1 withdrawal day. Exposure to these cues increased ERK phosphorylation in the central, but not the  basolateral, amygdala after 30 d, but not 1 d, of withdrawal. After 30 d of withdrawal from cocaine, inhibition of central, but not basolateral, amygdala ERK phosphorylation decreased cocaine seeking. After 1 d of withdrawal, stimulation of central amygdala ERK phosphorylation increased cocaine seeking. Results suggest that the incubation of cocaine craving is mediated by time-dependent increases in the responsiveness of the central amygdala ERK pathway to cocaine cues.", "14973246": "Cocaine addiction in humans is associated with long-term propensity to relapse. Using a rat relapse model, we found that cocaine seeking induced by exposure to cocaine-associated cues progressively increases after withdrawal. This progressive increase is associated with increases in brain-derived nerve growth factor (BDNF) levels within the mesolimbic dopamine system. Based on these findings, we studied whether BDNF infusions into the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the cell body region of mesolimbic dopamine neurons, would potentiate cocaine seeking after withdrawal. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine for 10 d, and cocaine seeking was measured in extinction tests 3, 10, or 30 d after withdrawal. During testing, rats were exposed to contextual cues that had predicted cocaine availability during training, and lever presses resulted in contingent presentations of a discrete tone-light cue that was previously temporally paired with cocaine infusions. BDNF (0-0.75 microg/site) or nerve growth factor (NGF; 0-0.75 microg/site) was infused into the VTA 1-2 hr after the last self-administration session. To examine the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in BDNF effects, U0126 (1 microg/site), an MEK inhibitor, was used. A single intra-VTA infusion of BDNF, but not NGF, induced long-lasting enhancement of cocaine seeking for up to 30 d, an effect reversed by U0126. In contrast, neither BDNF infusions into the substantia nigra, nor acute intra-VTA BDNF infusions 2 hr before testing on day 3 of withdrawal, were effective. These data suggest that BDNF-mediated neuroadaptations in mesolimbic areas are involved in the persistent cocaine seeking induced by exposure to drug  cues after withdrawal.", "19349975": "Plastic changes in glutamatergic synapses that lead to endurance of drug craving  and addiction are poorly understood. We examined the turnover and trafficking of  NMDA receptors and found that chronic exposure to the psychostimulant amphetamine (AMPH) induced selective downregulation of NMDA receptor NR2B subunits in the confined surface membrane pool of rat striatal neurons at synaptic sites. This downregulation was a long-lived event and was a result of the destabilization of  surface-expressed NR2B caused by accelerated ubiquitination and degradation of crucial NR2B-anchoring proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The biochemical loss of synaptic NR2B further translated to the modulation of synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term depression at cortico-accumbal glutamatergic synapses. Behaviorally, genetic disruption of NR2B induced and restoration of NR2B loss prevented behavioral sensitization to AMPH. Our data identify NR2B as an important regulator in the remodeling of excitatory synapses  and persistent psychomotor plasticity in response to AMPH.", "21957248": "The mesolimbic dopamine projection from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is critical in mediating reward-related behaviors, but the precise role of dopamine in this process remains unknown. We completed a series of studies to examine whether coincident changes occur in NAc cell firing  and rapid dopamine release during goal-directed behaviors for sucrose and if so,  to determine whether the two are causally linked. We show that distinct populations of NAc neurons differentially encode sucrose-directed behaviors, and  using a combined electrophysiology/electrochemistry technique, further show that  it is at those locations that rapid dopamine signaling is observed. To determine  causality, NAc cell firing was recorded during selective pharmacological inactivation of dopamine burst firing using the NMDA receptor antagonist, AP-5. We show that phasic dopamine selectively modulates excitatory but not inhibitory  responses of NAc neurons during sucrose-seeking behavior. Thus, rapid dopamine signaling does not exert global actions in the NAc but selectively modulates discrete NAc microcircuits that ultimately influence goal-directed actions.", "18725236": "Drug addiction can be defined by a compulsion to seek and take drug, loss of control in limiting intake, and the emergence of a negative emotional state when  access to the drug is prevented. Drug addiction impacts multiple motivational mechanisms and can be conceptualized as a disorder that progresses from impulsivity (positive reinforcement) to compulsivity (negative reinforcement). The construct of negative reinforcement is defined as drug taking that alleviates a negative emotional state. The negative emotional state that drives such negative reinforcement is hypothesized to derive from dysregulation of key neurochemical elements involved in reward and stress within the basal forebrain structures involving the ventral striatum and extended amygdala. Specific neurochemical elements in these structures include not only decreases in reward neurotransmission, such as decreases in dopamine and opioid peptide function in the ventral striatum, but also recruitment of brain stress systems, such as corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), in the extended amygdala. Acute withdrawal  from all major drugs of abuse produces increases in reward thresholds, increases  in anxiety-like responses, and increases in extracellular levels of CRF in the central nucleus of the amygdala. CRF receptor antagonists also block excessive drug intake produced by dependence. A brain stress response system is hypothesized to be activated by acute excessive drug intake, to be sensitized during repeated withdrawal, to persist into protracted abstinence, and to contribute to the compulsivity of addiction. Other components of brain stress systems in the extended amygdala that interact with CRF and may contribute to the negative motivational state of withdrawal include norepinephrine, dynorphin, and  neuropeptide Y. The combination of loss of reward function and recruitment of brain stress systems provides a powerful neurochemical basis for a negative emotional state that is responsible for the negative reinforcement driving, at least in part, the compulsivity of addiction.", "3947206": "Abstinence symptoms and psychiatric diagnoses were evaluated in 30 chronic cocaine abusers. Structured diagnostic interviews were done within an experimental design intended to maximize differentiation of enduring symptoms from symptoms linked to binges of cocaine use.

HTSeq offers parsers for many common data formats in HTS projects, as well as classes to represent data, such as genomic coordinates, sequences, sequencing reads, alignments, gene model information and variant calls, and provides data structures that allow for querying via genomic coordinates.

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been heavily implicated in the regulation of impulsive decision-making. However, lesions of the OFC in rats have both increased and decreased impulsivity in delay-discounting paradigms, where impulsive choice is defined as the selection of small immediate over larger delayed rewards. OBJECTIVES: Reviewing the different methods used, we hypothesized that the effects of OFC inactivation on delay discounting may be critically affected by both subjects' baseline level of impulsive choice and the presence or absence of  a cue to bridge the delay between selection and delivery of the large reward. RESULTS: Here, we show that OFC inactivation increased impulsive choice in less impulsive rats when the delay was cued, but decreased impulsive choice in highly  impulsive rats in an uncued condition. CONCLUSIONS: Providing explicit environmental cues to signal the delay-to-reinforcement appears to change the way in which the OFC is recruited in the decision-making process in a baseline-dependent fashion. This change may reflect activation of the dopamine system, as intra-OFC infusions of dopamine receptor antagonists increased impulsive choice but only when the delay was cued.", "24342569": "Binge eating, a central feature of multiple eating disorders, is characterized by excessive consumption occurring during discrete, often brief, intervals. Highly palatable foods play an important role in these binge episodes - foods chosen during bingeing are typically higher in fat or sugar than those normally consumed. Multiple lines of evidence suggest a central role for signaling by endogenous opioids in promoting palatability-driven eating. This role extends to  binge-like feeding studied in animal models, which is reduced by administration of opioid antagonists. However, the neural circuits and specific opioid receptors mediating these effects are not fully understood. In the present experiments, we  tested the hypothesis that endogenous opioid signaling in the nucleus accumbens promotes consumption in a model of binge eating. We used an anticipatory contrast paradigm in which separate groups of rats were presented sequentially with 4% sucrose and then either 20% or 0% sucrose solutions. In rats presented with 4% and then 20% sucrose, daily training in this paradigm produced robust intake of 20% sucrose, preceded by learned hypophagia during access to 4% sucrose. We tested the effects of site-specific infusions of naltrexone (a nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist: 0, 1, 10, and 50\u03bcg/side in the nucleus accumbens core and shell), naltrindole (a delta opioid receptor antagonist: 0, 0.5, 5, and 10\u03bcg/side in the nucleus accumbens shell) and beta-funaltrexamine (a mu opioid receptor antagonist: 0 and 2.5\u03bcg/side in the nucleus accumbens shell) on consumption in this contrast paradigm. Our results show that signaling through the mu opioid receptor in the nucleus accumbens shell is dynamically modulated during formation of learned food preferences, and promotes binge-like consumption of palatable foods based on these learned preferences.", "20826665": "Efficient reward seeking is essential for survival and invariably requires overcoming costs, such as physical effort and delay, which are constantly changing in natural settings. Dopamine transmission has been implicated in decisions weighing the benefits and costs of obtaining a reward, but it is still  unclear how dynamically changing effort and delay costs affect dopamine signaling to rewards and related stimuli. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, we examined phasic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) core and shell during reward-seeking behavior in rats. To manipulate the effort and time needed to earn a reward, we used instrumental tasks in which the response requirements (number of lever presses) were either fixed throughout a behavioral session [fixed ratio  (FR)] or systematically increased from trial to trial [progressive ratio (PR)]. Dopamine release evoked by cues denoting reward availability was no different between these conditions, indicating insensitivity to escalating effort or delay  costs. In contrast, dopamine release to reward delivery in both the NAcc core and shell increased in PR, but not in FR, sessions. This enhancement of reward-evoked dopamine signaling was also observed in sessions in which the response requirement was fixed but the delay to reward delivery increased, yoked to corresponding trials in PR sessions. These findings suggest that delay, and not effort, was principally responsible for the increased reward-evoked dopamine release in PR sessions. Together, these data demonstrate that NAcc dopamine release to rewards and their predictors are dissociable and differentially regulated by the delays conferred under escalating costs.", "20037591": "Neurotransmission operates on a millisecond timescale but is changed by normal experience or neuropathology over days to months. Despite the importance of long-term neurotransmitter dynamics, no technique exists to track these changes in a subject from day to day over extended periods of time.

Here, we focus on two transcription factors, CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) and DeltaFosB, which contribute to drug-induced changes in gene expression. Both are activated in the nucleus accumbens, a major brain reward region, but mediate different aspects of the addicted state. CREB mediates a form of tolerance and dependence, which dampens an individual's sensitivity to subsequent drug exposure and contributes to a negative emotional state during early phases of withdrawal. In contrast, DeltaFosB mediates a state of relatively prolonged sensitization to drug exposure and may contribute to the increased drive and motivation for drug, which is a core symptom of addictive disorders. A  major goal of current research is to identify the many target genes through which CREB and DeltaFosB mediate these behavioral states. In addition, future work needs to understand how CREB and DeltaFosB, acting in concert with numerous other drug-induced molecular changes in nucleus accumbens and many other brain regions, interact with one another to produce the complex behavioral phenotype that defines addiction.", "23726845": "Neuroplastic changes in the dorsal striatum participate in the transition from casual to habitual drug use and might play a critical role in the development of  methamphetamine (METH) addiction. We examined the influence of METH self-administration on gene and protein expression that may form substrates for METH-induced neuronal plasticity in the dorsal striatum. Male Sprague-Dawley rats self-administered METH (0.1mg/kg/injection, i.v.) or received yoked saline infusions during eight 15-h sessions and were euthanized 2h, 24h, or 1month after cessation of METH exposure. Changes in gene and protein expression were assessed  using microarray analysis, RT-PCR and Western blots. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by PCR was used to examine epigenetic regulation of METH-induced transcription. METH self-administration caused increases in mRNA expression of the transcription factors, c-fos and fosb, the neurotrophic factor, Bdnf, and the synaptic protein, synaptophysin (Syp) in the dorsal striatum. METH also caused changes in \u0394FosB, BDNF and TrkB protein levels, with increases after 2 and 24h, but decreases after 1month of drug abstinence. Importantly, ChIP-PCR showed that METH self-administration caused enrichment of phosphorylated CREB (pCREB), but not of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), on promoters of c-fos, fosb, Bdnf and Syp at 2h after cessation of drug intake. These findings show that METH-induced changes in gene expression are mediated, in part, by pCREB-dependent epigenetic phenomena. Thus, METH self-administration might trigger epigenetic changes that mediate alterations in  expression of genes and proteins serving as substrates for addiction-related synaptic plasticity.", "23000149": "Compulsive overconsumption of reward characterizes disorders ranging from binge eating to drug addiction. Here, we provide evidence that enkephalin surges in an  anteromedial quadrant of dorsal neostriatum contribute to generating intense consumption of palatable food. In ventral striatum, mu opioid circuitry contributes an important component of motivation to consume reward. In dorsal neostriatum, mu opioid receptors are concentrated within striosomes that receive  inputs from limbic regions of prefrontal cortex. We employed advanced opioid microdialysis techniques that allow detection of extracellular enkephalin levels. Endogenous >150% enkephalin surges in anterior dorsomedial neostriatum were triggered as rats began to consume palatable chocolates. In contrast, dynorphin levels remained unchanged. Furthermore, a causal role for mu opioid stimulation in overconsumption was demonstrated by observations that microinjection in the same anterior dorsomedial quadrant of a mu receptor agonist ([D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin; DAMGO) generated intense >250% increases in intake of palatable sweet food (without altering hedonic impact of sweet tastes). Mapping by \"Fos plume\" methods confirmed the hyperphagic effect to be anatomically localized to the anteromedial quadrant of the dorsal neostriatum, whereas other quadrants were relatively ineffective. These findings reveal that opioid signals  in anteromedial dorsal neostriatum are able to code and cause motivation to consume sensory reward.", "15922019": "The transition from casual drug use to addiction, and the intense drug craving that accompanies it, has been postulated to result from neuroadaptations within the limbic system caused by repeated drug exposure. This review will examine the  implications of cocaine-induced alterations in mesolimbic dopamine receptor signaling within the context of several widely used animal models of addiction. Extensive evidence indicates that dopaminergic mechanisms critically mediate behavioral sensitization to cocaine, cocaine-induced conditioned place preference, cocaine self-administration, and the drug prime-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior. The propagation of the long-term neuronal changes associated with recurring cocaine use appears to occur at the level of postreceptor signal transduction. Repeated cocaine treatment causes an up-regulation of the 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-signaling pathway within the nucleus accumbens, resulting in a dys-regulation of balanced D1/D2 dopamine-like receptor signaling. The intracellular events arising from enhanced D1-like postsynaptic signaling mediate both facilitatory and compensatory responses to the further reinforcing effects of cocaine.", "19560473": "There is emerging evidence that the neuropeptide oxytocin may be utilised as a treatment for various psychopathologies, including drug addictions. Here we used  an animal model to assess whether oxytocin might be effective in the treatment of methamphetamine addiction. Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to lever press to intravenously self-administer methamphetamine under a progressive ratio schedule  of reinforcement. Once responding had stabilised, one group of rats received escalating doses of oxytocin (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally (IP) prior to daily self-administration tests, while other rats received vehicle. After these tests, lever-pressing was extinguished and the ability of methamphetamine primes (IP, 1 mg/kg) to reinstate responding was studied with and without co-administration of oxytocin (IP, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg). Results showed that oxytocin dose-dependently reduced responding for intravenous  methamphetamine with an almost complete absence of responding at the highest oxytocin dose (1 mg/kg). Hyperactivity during methamphetamine self-administration was also dose-dependently reduced by oxytocin. Oxytocin (1 but not 0.3 mg/kg) also reduced the ability of methamphetamine to reinstate methamphetamine-seeking  behaviour. In separate tests, oxytocin (IP, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg) robustly decreased the hyperactivity and rearing induced by methamphetamine challenge (IP, 1 mg/kg), producing activity levels similar to control animals. This study suggests that oxytocin may have a powerful inhibitory effect on the motivation to consume methamphetamine and on hyperactivity associated with acute methamphetamine intoxication. These results point to the potential utility of human trials of oxytocin as a therapeutic treatment for methamphetamine addiction.", "23332758": "The sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein, is an interorganelle signaling modulator that potentially plays a role in drug-seeking behaviors. However, the brain site of action and underlying cellular mechanisms remain unidentified. We found that cocaine exposure triggers a Sig-1R-dependent upregulation of D-type K(+) current in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) that results in neuronal hypoactivity and thereby enhances behavioral cocaine response. Combining ex vivo and in vitro studies, we demonstrated that this neuroadaptation is caused by a persistent protein-protein association between Sig-1Rs and Kv1.2 channels, a phenomenon that is associated to a redistribution of both proteins from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane. In conclusion, the dynamic Sig-1R-Kv1.2 complex represents a mechanism  that shapes neuronal and behavioral response to cocaine. Functional consequences  of Sig-1R binding to K(+) channels may have implications for other chronic diseases where maladaptive intrinsic plasticity and Sig-1Rs are engaged.", "7393973": "Extinction and recovery of cocaine self-administration following 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nucleus accumbens.", "7552315": "The ventral tegmental area receives a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) innervation  from the nucleus accumbens and contains GABA immunoreactive neurons believed to be interneurons. We combined the immunocytochemical detection of retrogradely transported Fluoro-Gold (FG) from the nucleus accumbens (Acb) with the detection  of GABA within the same section of tissue in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of  the rat brain to determine whether there might also be reciprocal GABAergic projections in the mesolimbic pathway. Immunoperoxidase labeling for FG and immunogold-silver labeling for GABA were most readily distinguished within perikarya and dendrites in sections examined by electron microscopy. Ultrastructural observations indicated that 36% (n = 110) of the FG-labeled perikarya and dendrites also contained GABA immunoreactivity. The present results provide the first evidence that GABA is contained in a subpopulation of neurons in the mesolimbic pathway from the VTA to the Acb. The reciprocity of this circuitry may provide an important feedback loop thus facilitating inhibition of  motor activity.", "19015660": "RNA-Seq is a recently developed approach to transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequencing technologies. Studies using this method have already altered our  view of the extent and complexity of eukaryotic transcriptomes. RNA-Seq also provides a far more precise measurement of levels of transcripts and their isoforms than other methods. This article describes the RNA-Seq approach, the challenges associated with its application, and the advances made so far in characterizing several eukaryote transcriptomes.", "16972104": "RATIONALE: Impaired inhibitory control over behavior is a key feature in various  psychiatric disorders, and recent studies indicated an important role for dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors and the nucleus accumbens (Acb) in this respect. OBJECTIVE: The present experiments were designed to study the role of dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors in the Acb in inhibitory response control. METHODS: Rats were trained in a five-choice serial reaction time task and received bilateral infusions into the Acb core or shell of either SCH 23390 or eticlopride (representing selective dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptor antagonists,  respectively). Subsequently, the effects of systemic amphetamine on inhibitory response control were examined. RESULTS: Eticlopride into either the Acb core or shell did not affect premature responding, a measure for inhibitory response control, but increased reaction time and errors of omission. In contrast, SCH 23390 into both regions reduced premature responding, slightly improved attentional performance in the core and increased errors of omission in the shell. Amphetamine robustly increased premature responding which was dose-dependently blocked by eticlopride in the Acb core and attenuated by eticlopride in the shell. In addition, amphetamine slightly decreased accuracy and reaction time, and these effects were inhibited by eticlopride in both regions. SCH 23390 infusion into the Acb core or shell did not alter amphetamine's effects. CONCLUSION: Our data provide evidence for the involvement of dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors in the Acb core and shell in inhibitory response control and attentional performance.", "8229752": "Dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens may be an important factor in ethanol reinforcement and genetically determined ethanol preference. This hypothesis was tested by measuring dopamine (DA) release by intracranial microdialysis during voluntary oral ethanol self-administration in alcohol-preferring (P) and genetically heterogeneous Wistar rats. The animals were trained to respond for ethanol (10% w/v) or water in a free-choice operant task. Extracellular DA levels in the nucleus accumbens were subsequently monitored during 30-min self-administration sessions and a 15-min \"waiting period\" before session onset. Ethanol self-administration in all animals was followed by a significant, dose-dependent rise in DA release with maximal effects at approximately 15 min after peak intake. Dose-effect functions revealed significantly steeper slopes for the DA-releasing effects of ethanol in P than in genetically heterogeneous Wistar rats. Over an identical range of ethanol doses and blood alcohol levels, increases in DA efflux ranged from 143% to 459% of basal levels in P rats but only from 142% to 212% in Wistar rats. To differentiate the pharmacological effects of ethanol from the effects of operant  responding, additional groups of P and Wistar rats were tested during self-administration of saccharin (0.05% w/v). By contrast with ethanol, saccharin did not substantially elevate extracellular DA levels. A significant, transient increase in DA efflux was, however, observed in both strains of rats during the presession waiting period in the absence of ethanol or saccharin availability.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "18565549": "Cue-induced drug-seeking in rodents progressively increases after withdrawal from cocaine, suggesting that cue-induced cocaine craving incubates over time. Here, we explored the role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC, a brain area previously implicated in cue-induced cocaine seeking) in this incubation. We trained rats to self-administer cocaine for 10days (6h/day, infusions were paired with a tone-light cue), and then assessed after 1 or 30 withdrawal days the effect of exposure to cocaine cues on lever presses in extinction tests. We found that cue-induced cocaine-seeking in the extinction tests was higher after 30 withdrawal days than after 1day. The time-dependent increases in extinction responding were associated with large (ventral mPFC) or modest (dorsal mPFC) increases in ERK phosphorylation (a measure of ERK activity and an index of neuronal activation). After 30 withdrawal days, ventral but not dorsal injections of muscimol+baclofen (GABAa+GABAb receptor agonists that inhibit neuronal activity) decreased extinction responding. After 1 withdrawal day, ventral but not dorsal mPFC injections of bicuculline+saclofen (GABAa+GABAb receptor antagonists that increase neuronal activity) strongly increased extinction responding. Finally, muscimol+baclofen had minimal effect on extinction responding after 1day, and in cocaine-experienced rats, ventral mPFC injections of muscimol+baclofen or bicuculline+saclofen had no effect on lever presses for an oral sucrose solution. The present results indicate that ventral mPFC neuronal activity plays an important role in the incubation of cocaine craving.", "21490964": "Relief fits the definition of a reward. Unlike other reward types the pleasantness of relief depends on the violation of a negative expectation, yet this has not been investigated using neuroimaging approaches. We hypothesized that the degree of negative expectation depends on state (dread) and trait (pessimism) sensitivity. Of the brain regions that are involved in mediating pleasure, the nucleus accumbens also signals unexpected reward and positive prediction error. We hypothesized that accumbens activity reflects the level of negative expectation and subsequent pleasant relief. Using fMRI and two purpose-made tasks, we compared hedonic and BOLD responses to relief with responses during an appetitive reward task in 18 healthy volunteers. We expected  some similarities in task responses, reflecting common neural substrates implicated across reward types. However, we also hypothesized that relief responses would differ from appetitive rewards in the nucleus accumbens, since only relief pleasantness depends on negative expectations. The results confirmed  these hypotheses. Relief and appetitive reward task activity converged in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which also correlated with appetitive reward pleasantness ratings. In contrast, dread and pessimism scores correlated with relief but not with appetitive reward hedonics. Moreover, only relief pleasantness covaried with accumbens activation. Importantly, the accumbens signal appeared to specifically reflect individual differences in anticipation of the adverse event (dread, pessimism) but was uncorrelated to appetitive reward hedonics. In conclusion, relief differs from appetitive rewards due to its reliance on negative expectations, the violation of which is reflected in relief-related accumbens activation.", "24939695": "Methamphetamine use disorder is a chronic neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent binge episodes, intervals of abstinence, and relapses to drug use. Humans addicted to methamphetamine experience various degrees of cognitive deficits and other neurological abnormalities that complicate their activities of daily living and their participation in treatment programs. Importantly, models of methamphetamine addiction in rodents have shown that animals will readily learn to give themselves methamphetamine. Rats also accelerate their intake over  time. Microarray studies have also shown that methamphetamine taking is associated with major transcriptional changes in the striatum measured within a short or longer time after cessation of drug taking. After a 2-h withdrawal time, there was increased expression of genes that participate in transcription regulation. These included cyclic AMP response element binding (CREB), ETS domain-containing protein (ELK1), and members of the FOS family of transcription  factors. Other genes of interest include brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tyrosine kinase receptor, type 2 (TrkB), and synaptophysin. Methamphetamine-induced transcription was found to be regulated via phosphorylated CREB-dependent events. After a 30-day withdrawal from methamphetamine self-administration, however, there was mostly decreased expression of transcription factors including junD. There was also downregulation of genes whose protein products are constituents of chromatin-remodeling complexes. Altogether, these genome-wide results show that methamphetamine abuse  might be associated with altered regulation of a diversity of gene networks that  impact cellular and synaptic functions. These transcriptional changes might serve as triggers for the neuropsychiatric presentations of humans who abuse this drug. Better understanding of the way that gene products interact to cause methamphetamine addiction will help to develop better pharmacological treatment of methamphetamine addicts.", "18653439": "The conceptualization of drug addiction as a compulsive disorder with excessive drug intake and loss of control over intake requires motivational mechanisms. Opponent process as a motivational theory for the negative reinforcement of drug  dependence has long required a neurobiological explanation. Key neurochemical elements involved in reward and stress within basal forebrain structures involving the ventral striatum and extended amygdala are hypothesized to be dysregulated in addiction to convey the opponent motivational processes that drive dependence. Specific neurochemical elements in these structures include not only decreases in reward neurotransmission such as dopamine and opioid peptides in the ventral striatum, but also recruitment of brain stress systems such as corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), noradrenaline and dynorphin in the extended amygdala. Acute withdrawal from all major drugs of abuse produces increases in reward thresholds, anxiety-like responses and extracellular levels of CRF in the  central nucleus of the amygdala. CRF receptor antagonists block excessive drug intake produced by dependence. A brain stress response system is hypothesized to  be activated by acute excessive drug intake, to be sensitized during repeated withdrawal, to persist into protracted abstinence and to contribute to stress-induced relapse. The combination of loss of reward function and recruitment of brain stress systems provides a powerful neurochemical basis for the long hypothesized opponent motivational processes responsible for the negative reinforcement driving addiction.", "23475113": "Induction of histone acetylation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region, promotes cocaine-induced alterations in gene expression. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) tightly regulate the acetylation of histone tails, but little is known about the functional specificity of different HDAC isoforms in the development and maintenance of cocaine-induced plasticity, and previous studies of HDAC inhibitors report conflicting effects on cocaine-elicited behavioral adaptations. Here we demonstrate that specific and prolonged blockade  of HDAC1 in NAc of mice increased global levels of histone acetylation, but also  induced repressive histone methylation and antagonized cocaine-induced changes in behavior, an effect mediated in part through a chromatin-mediated suppression of  GABAA receptor subunit expression and inhibitory tone on NAc neurons. Our findings suggest a new mechanism by which prolonged and selective HDAC inhibition can alter behavioral and molecular adaptations to cocaine and inform the development of therapeutics for cocaine addiction.", "17884016": "BACKGROUND: Although heavy smoking has been associated with impulsivity in humans, it is not clear whether poor impulse control represents a risk factor in  the etiology of nicotine dependence. METHODS: To address this issue, rats were selected on the basis of individual differences in impulsivity in the delayed reward task (impulsive choice) and the  5-choice serial reaction time task (impulsive action). Subsequently, rats were subjected to a nicotine self-administration (SA) paradigm tailored to measure the motivational properties of nicotine and nicotine-associated stimuli. In separate  groups, differences in electrically evoked dopamine release in slice preparations obtained from several mesolimbic brain regions were determined. RESULTS: Impulsive action was associated with an enhanced motivation to initiate  and maintain nicotine SA. In contrast, impulsive choice predicted a diminished ability to inhibit nicotine seeking during abstinence and an enhanced vulnerability to relapse upon re-exposure to nicotine cues. Impulsive action was  associated with reduced dopamine release in the accumbens core and impulsive choice with reduced dopamine release in accumbens core, shell, and medial prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The strong association between sub-dimensions of impulsivity and nicotine SA implies that interventions aimed to improve impulse control might help to reduce susceptibility to nicotine dependence and/or lead to successful smoking cessation.", "9491897": "The hypothalamus plays a central role in the integrated control of feeding and energy homeostasis. We have identified two novel neuropeptides, both derived from the same precursor by proteolytic processing, that bind and activate two closely  related (previously) orphan G protein-coupled receptors. These peptides, termed orexin-A and -B, have no significant structural similarities to known families of regulatory peptides. prepro-orexin mRNA and immunoreactive orexin-A are localized in neurons within and around the lateral and posterior hypothalamus in the adult  rat brain. When administered centrally to rats, these peptides stimulate food consumption. prepro-orexin mRNA level is up-regulated upon fasting, suggesting a  physiological role for the peptides as mediators in the central feedback mechanism that regulates feeding behavior."}
